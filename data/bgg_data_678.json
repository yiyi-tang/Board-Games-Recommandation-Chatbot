    "Description": "From the website:&#10;&#10;Faction Wars is a skirmish game designed for 2 or more players and involves using 28mm miniatures on a table with some terrain to represent your forces. Each player has a squad of around 10 to 15 models with which to beat their opponent.&#10;&#10;Most wargamers who are interested in the sci-fi genre will already have a large collection of suitable miniatures. Instead of having to buy more, you can use the ones you have got to play Faction Wars.&#10;&#10;The game is very easy to learn, but still offers a level of detail that should engage even the most experienced wargamers. Faction Wars is set in the not-too-distant future, so some of the technology and weapons will be familiar, but with plenty of added science fiction to bring the universe to life.&#10;&#10;The human race has escaped the clutches of Earth and colonised the galaxy. The invention of wormhole technology has allowed the vast gulfs of empty space to be crossed. However, this vastness is also leading to the downfall of the Commonwealth. The supreme political figure is the High Guardian, who is losing control over the rapidly expanding wave of colonisation. A number of factions, all with greatly different agendas and ideas battle against each other in small skirmishes right across the galaxy.&#10;&#10;The rulebook contains:&#10;&#10;* An introduction to the Inviroate Commonwealth of the Federated Worlds&#10;    * Background material on each of the 9 factions&#10;    * Plenty of colour photos and original artwork&#10;    * Rules for playing the game, plus some scenarios&#10;    * Stats and background for each faction to allow you to build up your squad&#10;    * Stats and background for Special Characters&#10;    * Lists of weapons, armour, equipment, skills and psionic abilities to equip your sqaud&#10;    * Suggestions for creating terrain and setting up your gaming table&#10;    * Rules for using vehicles within the game&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The original Pentathlon of the ancient Olympic Games were based on the ideal soldier of the time, skilled in running, jumping, wrestling, and throwing (javelin and discus).  Thus Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic games, invented the Modern Pentathlon based on the ideal soldier of his time, recreating the experience of a 19th century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines: running, swimming, riding, and fighting (with pistol and sword).  In the vein of Reiner Knizia's Decathlon, this is a collection of dice games loosely based off the real-life events.&#10;&#10;The five events capture a wide spectrum dice game mechanics, including push-your-luck, calculated risks, bluffing, and set collection.  Players who have read Dr. Knizia's book Dice Games Properly Explained will find the events draw upon various traditional games, but combine and develop their mechanics to place more emphasis on decisions than luck.  For example, in the 200m Freestyle Swimming and Pistol Shooting events, players may continually purchase rerolls to mitigate bad luck but should consider the trade-off of how much that would benefit their opponents.  In Epee Fencing, players always have exactly 7 points to allocate each round, and so the event is more about bluff and discerning their opponent's actions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Steam Lords is a game of resource management for 2 ruthless players. To win you must use your resources wisely to construct 12 victory points worth of buildings along the Shale River which runs through the different quarters of the City of Iron.&#10;&#10;Needed to play: the deck of 34 cards and 35 markers per player in 2 colors.&#10;&#10;Setup: Place the 4 Quarter Cards comprising the map of the Shale River between players.&#10;&#10;The 4 quarters of the city each have 6 buildings on them that can be constructed by players. Each building is worth 1 victory point towards the goal of 12. Further, each building allows players to use the special power of that quarter of the city to place more workers, distribute resources or purchase cards in the game.&#10;&#10;Next each player takes a set of the 5 Industry Cards: Foundry, Trade Guild, Civil Service, Builders and Shipwrights and places them below their side of the river.&#10;&#10;Industry Cards are used to construct the buildings along the river by placing resources on the 5 icons on each card. Once enough resources have been accrued, players may construct one of the buildings, though each industry type only constructs one or two particular types of building based on which Quarter Cards the industries are adjacent to.&#10;&#10;Next each player takes a set of the 4 Resource Cards: Brick Kiln, Textile Mill, Lumbermill and Smelter. Players shuffle these cards and randomly lay them out below the Industry Cards. Place the Contract Card within reach of both players. Then lay out the 11 Upgrade Cards face up within reach of both players.&#10;&#10;Lastly, players each take 4 of their 30 eurocube markers and place them on four icons on any of their Industry Cards. Players may only place a marker on one each of the four resource types. Each card shows icons for a different resource type used in the game to construct the buildings and purchase upgrade cards.&#10;&#10;Play: Steam Lords is divided into rounds of four phases. Players take turns during phases 1, 3 and 4, and play simultaneously during phase 2. Players will alternate going first between rounds, with Player One going first in the first round, Player Two going first in the 2nd round, etc... Once all 4 phases have been completed, a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Contract&#10;Players take turns placing 5 workers (eurocube markers) on the Contract Card claiming either resources or distribution rights.&#10;Phase 2: Distribute&#10;Players simultaneously distribute resources, moving markers from the Resource Cards to the Industry Cards.&#10;During this phase, each player may &lsquo;deliver&rsquo; any resources for a total of 5 card units in distance. To calculate distance, count the number of cards up and over to the left or right you wish to move a resource.&#10;Phase 3: Build&#10;Players take turns constructing buildings on the Quarter Cards if they have all 5 resources needed on their Industry Cards.&#10;If a player has all 5 icons marked on an Industry Card, they may remove those markers and construct any of the unclaimed buildings on a Quarter Card. Once all 6 buildings have been constructed no more can be claimed. Each building built on a Quarter Card is worth 1VP.&#10;Phase 4: Upgrade&#10;Players take turns buying Upgrade Cards one at a time, and may only buy Upgrade Cards if they have built buildings in Coalside during phase 3. For each building built in Coalside, a player may buy 1 Upgrade Card during this phase. To purchase an Upgrade Card, a player must pay the number of resources shown at the bottom of each Upgrade Card. They may then take the card and place it in front of them.&#10;&#10;Four of the Upgrade Cards allow players to store additional resources on the Resource Cards. After purchasing one of the four cards replace the existing Resource Card with the new one. Each of these cards is worth 2VP. Seven of the Upgrade Cards let you construct building with fewer resources, gain distribution units or place more workers in phase 1. The cards list their respective upgrades.&#10;&#10;An expanded set of 12 additional cards has also been included for a longer game.&#10;&#10;Artscow direct order - http://www.artscow.com/gallery/playing-cards/steam-lords-wym0ul1sbgjg&#10;&#10;",

But, unfortunately you will soon discover that your church is composed not only of SPIRITUAL and CARNAL members, but also of HYPOCRITES.  On the other hand, your church can grow spiritually as you DISCIPLE these same members from HYPOCRITES to CARNAL and also from CARNAL to SPIRITUAL.&#10;&#10;Along the way you will encounter CIRCUMSTANCES which, depending upon the presence or absence of SPIRITUAL GIFTS in your church, will either help or hinder your overall growth.&#10;&#10;But sooner or later on one of the CIRCUMSTANCE cards, the RAPTURE will appear.  (Guaranteed to get a rise out of everybody).  Suddenly the game ends; and the SPIRITUALITY of your church is weighed in the balance (in this game, by a point system.  Will your church be found wanting... more points?)  The church with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Definitions:  Whats the RAPTURE?  Something to get all up in the air about, and the point at which the game ends.&#10;&#10;Whats the Church?  Another good question.  We've been debating it for years.  For our purposes, in RAPTURE there are no buildings -- just people.&#10;&#10;What are SPIRITUAL GIFTS?  A part of this game and the REAL one.  There are over 20 listed in the Bible, we've selected 7 for this game.&#10;&#10;Whats the difference between a CARNAL and SPIRITUAL member?  See 1 Corinthians 3:1-3.&#10;---&#10;&#10;The game is a roll and move type game with different things happening based on the different spaces the player lands on.&#10;&#10;",

There are two cards that instruct you as to how this might be done, and suggesting that it should be to scale (5 yards to the inch).&#10;The other 52 cards relate to moving your ball towards your opponent's goal (whilst he is trying to do the same to you). It is only a card game so no equipment is provided (as in the pitch mentioned earlier and the designer suggests you use buttons for the ball).&#10;The object is to be the first to score 4 goals. Scoring a goal usually refers to a move card being played that crosses the goal-line.&#10;Every card has a Kevin Keegan football tip on it.&#10;The box clearly states that the game is for 2 to 6 players, but the rules only suggest up to 4 players. Either way, it is really a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;",

(This is where the strategy comes in) Do you pick a lower point card or a higher point card? The Youngest player then rolls the three dice, trying to match one of the die or combination of dice to their card amount which is face up. Each time the die/dice combination match the player's card that is face up, the player gets to move the card into their &quot;mile pile&quot; trying to be the first to hike 100 miles. Players must beware of getting caught with a &quot;cooler card&quot; - like the mother bear &amp; cubs in the trail. If you get caught with one of the three cooler cards you loose 10 miles. Other twists in the game include bonus rolls if the player&rsquo;s dice totals the card amount that is face up. Don&rsquo;t forget to look out for the trips /doubles rule which is when any of the dice come up with doubles or triples. You take a card from the person to your right.&#10;&#10;",

Alternatively, you could add a card from your hand, and add it to the amount on the card on the table, with a view to taking it next turn with a card equal to the total on the two cards which you were 'building'. However, before your next turn comes round, another player might be able to take your 'build'.&#10;There are special cards that score more than normal.&#10;The game ends when the pack runs out. Cards you captured are added up, their face value in money. Then any Lucky Pennies score as 1 shilling. Any Lucky Sixpence scores 2 shillings. Any Money Boxes score 4 shillings and twopence.

The method for answering is quite novel. Instead of a straight a) b) c) d) multiple choice, you pick your answer and go to the next card according to the number next to that answer. You should find that your set of answers takes you back to your starting card after eight questions.&#10;&#10;There is interaction between the players when one person thinks they need a cards already used by another in their answer. There is then a challenge for the card because each card can only appear in a single set of answers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The word &quot;chametz&quot; is Hebrew and refers to the food items and derivatives that are prohibited during the week of the Jewish holiday Passover (usually bread and other items containing five prohibited grains: barley, wheat, oat, rye and spelt).  Egregious examples of chametz include pizza, donuts, cookies, cupcakes, pretzels, and crackers.  &quot;Chametz: The Search is On!&quot; is played similarly to &quot;Clue&quot; but instead of deducing a murder, the players must determine which character left which item of chametz in which room.  It's especially appropriate because Jewish law requires families to search their home and clean it of all chametz before Passover begins.&#10;&#10;The board is a blueprint of a house with six rooms (kitchen, bedroom, dining room, living room, office and garage).  There are also six items of food and six characters.&#10;&#10;Eighteen cards are included (one for each character, food and room).  After separating the cards into the 3 categories and secretly hiding one character, one food and one room in the small envelope provided, the remaining cards are shuffled and then dealt out to the entire group, clockwise, until all cards are gone.  Players may begin in any room as long as they choose it before seeing their cards.  They take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine how far they can walk around the perimeter of the home (with entrances off the main spaces).&#10;&#10;Upon entering a room, players may make a guess as to the hidden person, food and room.  The player to their left may prove them wrong by showing a card in their hand that matches one of the items in the guess. If that player has no matches, the guess goes to the next person.  If nobody has a match, the player can check the hidden cards to see if they're right.&#10;&#10;Players do not have to write with pen or pencil (another prohibition for Jews on the Sabbath and Holidays) and instead place cardboard markers in a noteboard with 18 slots (one for each item).&#10;&#10;The cardboard markers can be placed in the slot in such a way as to &quot;point&quot; left, right or up, and may be used to remind yourself who showed you that particular item.&#10;&#10;There are 4 mandatory &quot;Question Squares&quot; on the board and 4 optional ones.  When landing on these squares, the player is read a question from the stack of Question Cards based on another roll of the die (each Question Card has True/False, Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-Blank versions of the question).  A roll of 1 or 2 gets the easier True-False version, and 5 or 6 gets the hardest Fill-in-the-Blank version.  The questions pertain to Passover and Jewish History.&#10;&#10;After answering correctly, the player may immediately jump to any room on the board and make a guess.  There are no secret passageways between rooms otherwise.&#10;&#10;First player to guess the hidden character, food and room wins.  To play with 2 players, one card is placed face down in each room before dealing the cards out.  So when entering a room, the player may choose to make a guess or look at the face-down card (it's essentially a 3rd player who shows one of their cards when you enter each room).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Yiddishe Kop is a game of brain teasers and riddles with a Jewish bent.  The box contains 134 Puzzle Cards with 3 clues each and the answer printed upside down; and 20 Query Cards that say: &quot;This card good for one yes or no question.&quot;&#10;&#10;To begin play, one player becomes the &quot;Puzzle Master&quot; and deals the 20 Query cards to the players one at a time left-to-right until the cards are gone.  With 5 players, each player gets 4 Query Cards.&#10;&#10;The Puzzle Master then chooses a Puzzle Card and reads the puzzle to the group (and reads the answer to themselves only).&#10;&#10;From left-to-right players turn in a Query Card to ask a yes-or-no question.  The four possible answers are &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Irrelevant,&quot; and &quot;Partially Correct.&quot;  If the questioner receive a &quot;Yes&quot; they may continue to ask follow-up questions without playing another Query Card.  If they receive any other answer, play moves to their left.&#10;&#10;Players need to pay close attention to the questions being asked so they don't duplicate questions.&#10;&#10;Whoever answers the puzzle correctly keeps the Puzzle Card.  If no one is able to determine the answer before all the Query Cards are played, the Puzzle Master keeps the Puzzle Card and the role of Puzzle Master rotates to their left and the Query Cards are dealt again.  The object of the game is to win 3 Puzzle Cards.&#10;&#10;The Puzzle Master is the final arbiter, but if the answer is read and the group unanimously believes the Puzzle Master gave incorrect or misleading answers, they do not keep the Puzzle Card and sit out the next round.&#10;&#10;Players may play alone by reading the 3 clues provided one by one and trying to deduce the answer.&#10;&#10;",

They hurry to investigate, only to find a great eagle, suffering from wounds that appear to have come from goblin weapons. They only have short time to get the eagle assistance before it perishes.&#10;&#10;A Journey To Rhosgobel is the third Adventure Pack in the Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game! After facing a fearsome group of trolls, the heroes have pressed further into the Anduin Valley to continue their search for Gollum. However, when they stumble across a dying eagle wounded in a fight with goblins, they are compelled to offer their assistance.&#10;&#10;During their search for Gollum, the heroes must take a detour in order to save a valuable ally. Since the Eagles play such an important role in the Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure Packs, players will want to retain the trust of their winged allies by saving one of their kin. In order to do so, they must bring the bird to Rhosgobel and seek out the wizard Radagast, who knows many secrets of the wild.&#10;&#10;A Journey to Rhosgobel contains 60 fixed cards from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. In this exciting expansion, even more Eagles join the Tactics sphere, while Leadership players are given a D&uacute;nedain Quest that will inspire confidence in their cause. The heroes&rsquo; trek through Mirkwood leads them to Haldir of L&oacute;rien, whose unnatural agility will aid the party in their task. However, the sky grows dark with foul minions of the Shadow, and every step toward Rhosgobel causes the heroes&rsquo; avian ally more pain. There is no time to lose!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tired of the everyday hustle and bustle of everyday life and work, you decide to try to earn your fortune with a yacht you have inherited from an uncle you never knew.  You fly down to the yacht&rsquo;s location, but as it turns out the &ldquo;yacht&rdquo; is a small junker that is questionably seaworthy.&#10;&#10;Can you make a living with this boat?  What can you do?  Fish?  Become a rum runner?  While contemplating your future at a local restaurant, the local news station runs a story depicting a man and his crew popping a bottle of Champagne as they celebrate finding a wreck full of Spanish treasure.  &ldquo;Why not me?&rdquo; you ask yourself....  Why not you?&#10;&#10;Armed only with your boat and 50 Trade Credits (TCs), you decide to set out tomorrow to find treasure and fame in the waters between the U.S. and the Bahamas.  You will have to learn to dive, sail, and methods for search and recovery.  Will you try to advance conservatively, or try to advance quickly by luck?  Will you try to depend on cheaper equipment, or spend the fruits of your labors on the latest in high-tech equipment?  It will not be easy, and the competition with other wanna-be treasure hunters will be fierce.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to become the most renowned treasure hunter the Bahamas has ever known.  Up to 6 players take on the role of one of 16 international treasure hunters, each with different individual strengths.  Players may choose to visit the ports of Miami, Port Lucaya, or Alice Town to purchase and sell dive equipment, boating equipment, search and recovery supplies, and other merchandise; players may choose to explore unexplored areas of the sea by turning over sea tiles with random depths, or dive in explored areas.&#10;&#10;A player begins as an unexperienced diver, limited to shallow depths, limited by poor air consuption, and lack of equipment.  Beginning divers will be glad to recover minor treasures such as lobster, and shells during their freedives.  The more dives that are completed the more experience is gained.  The diver is allowed to make dives leading to greater depths, and with a larger possibility to obtain greater treasure.  The greater the treasure the diver recovers, the more Trade Credits a diver will earn at market.  The combination of experience and Trade Credits will allow the diver to eventually recover treasures that are worth too much money to sell on market, but can be donated to the Miami Nautical Museum in exchange for Victory Points.  The first player to win 10 victory points becomes the most renowned treasure hunter the Bahamas has ever known, and is the victor!&#10;&#10;DIVE! is a board game made by a diver, but which can be played by divers and non-divers alike.  No dive experience is needed, however, those familiar with diving will recognize diving concepts.  Divers will also recognize some of the concepts in this game are not exactly realistic.  That is because making real concepts unrealistic, makes the game fun!  That being said, playing DIVE! should not be seen as a substitution for scuba training, and the concepts in the game should not be used in actual diving.  If you are interested in diving, please contact your local PADI dive center.&#10;&#10;",

To move their pony-shaped player piece, players take turns drawing cards from a stack of 32 cards.

If a pony lands on the space directly in front of one of the two shortcuts, it takes the shortcut. If it lands on a flag field, it can only move on after the player has drawn another horseshoe card of the same colour.&#10;The player whose pony is first to reach the castle wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1862 Cross Keys (American Civil War in 3D)&#10;&#10;This is our fourth and penultimate of five battles in the Jackson Valley Campaign of 1862 and the eighth battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D.It sees a Union force under General John C Fr&eacute;mont launching an attack against Ewell&rsquo;s division, whilst the Confederate General Thomas J Stonewall Jackson is holding Port Republic against another pending Union attack (The final battle of the series).&#10;&#10;The Union army outnumbers the Confederates nearly two to one, so can they change history this time around and win at the battle of Cross Keys?&#10;&#10;Cross Keys initially has a time limit of 14 bounds in which the Union must achieve their task objective.Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game with in a 1 to 2 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavor of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&#10;&#10;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&#10;&#10;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User Summary&#10;&#10;Based on the game from the original Battlestar Galactica television series. Game play is similar to that of Poker. The deck consists of 56 cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;     52 Pyramid cards (divided into 4 suits - red, green, black, brown)&#10;     4 Cylon cards (similar to Jokers)&#10;&#10;&#10;The value of the cards are determined by a symbol system of dots, lines, and triangles (pyramids). One dot has the value of 1 and one line has the value of 5. The highest value of the dot line cards is 13, with the pyramid card out ranking that. However a pyramid card can also rank low in a sequence of cards, much like an Ace can in standard playing cards.&#10;&#10;Sequence examples:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10 (much like Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10)&#10;     5, 4, 3, 2, Pyramid (much like 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace)&#10;&#10;&#10;Cylon cards are used as wild cards, and can be played one of two ways. The card can either be a stand in for which ever card the player wants it to be OR it can be the Cap Stone to created a Full Pyramid, which is the highest possible winning hand in the game.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt initially 5 cards in Pyramid. The cards are dealt out like in Poker, one at a time around the table, beginning with the player to the dealer's left.&#10;&#10;Once the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left bets first and places their bet into the pot. Then the dealer will ask if anyone would like new cards and how many they want. Players can discard up to 4 cards.&#10;&#10;After the new cards are dealt, each player can either surrender (discard and sit out the hand), call (match the pot), or raise (match the pot and raise it). If a player decides to raise, every other player must match this raise in order to stay in the game or surrender.&#10;&#10;The following is the rank of winning Pyramid hands:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Full Pyramid - Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Cylon&#10;     Kobol - Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10&#10;     Colony - 5 cards in sequence AND of the same color&#10;     Quorum - 5 cards in sequence of any color&#10;     Quad - 4 cards of the same rank, one of each color&#10;     Triad - 3 of a kind&#10;     Duo - a pair&#10;&#10;&#10;If more than one player has matching hand types, then the hand that has the highest card wins out. For example two players have a Quorum. One player has 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and the other player has 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. The second player, the one with the 8, beats the hand of the first player.&#10;&#10;Much like Poker, Pyramid is a game of bets and bluffs. The goal is to win the most money in the end. Use your wits and your best Pyramid face to win all the Cubits!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An infrastructure building game in which players spend resources to upgrade camps (a kind of tech track) and draw special power cards (from 3 different decks with different styles of effects).  Players can choose to split their resource draws between the 'rare' and 'common' resource decks, and will need cards from both decks to make upgrades and purchase cards.  Trading is permitted, and the game encourages creative trades.  The game ends wither when a player hits 12 VP.  However, when players draw Artifacts from the resource decks (which serve as wild cards), the 'discovery dawning track' advances; if it completed, the game ends and the victor is determined by counting a different sort of VP.&#10;&#10;The game includes basic and advanced rules, so that beginners are not overwhelmed by the special powers available to them.  There are several viable paths to victory, and the game supports different play styles depending on your chosen path to victory (isolationist, interactive, aggressive).&#10;&#10;From the beginning of the rules:&#10;Welcome to a mysterious island in the Bermuda Triangle, where you and your opponents represent freshly-arrived teams in search of incredible power and money.  In order to be victorious, you must manage resourced wisely, plan coordinated attacks, and accomplish cunning trades.  Multiple routes exist to the finish line - will you be the one who best analyzes the given situation an emerges victorious?  This is what you will discover in Bermuda Crisis: Discovery Dawning.&#10;&#10;",

It's November 1965 all over again and YOU are under fire on a 'Hot LZ' and there is only one way in and one way out...by air. New counters join the system in the form of multiple helicopter models, the 'Thumper Gunner', M60 machine-guns, and more.&#10;&#10;With ATS LZ X-RAY you'll be brought in....and hopefully back out again in a series of scenarios that depict the action from initial landing to Hot LZ and then some. Moore, Plumley, and all the valiant soldiers depicted in the book and movie &quot;We Were Soldiers Once&quot; are there and back in action again, facing a determined enemy with one goal: overrun the LZ and the men of the 7th Air Cav. You'll find all the termite mounds you can handle, NVA Regulars, historical leader counters, and Hueys...Hueys...Hueys...in various models. All with DETAILED COLOR MILITARY ART used for the die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;LZ X-RAY provides all the combat counters you need to play, just bring your own ATS marker counters, ATS rulebook and standard play aids.&#10;&#10;",

What is important is that you are aiming to collect groups of 3, 4 or 5 cards of the same value.&#10;Points are scored by having such sets, with each group scoring the value of the cards in the group.

    "Description": "Battle of Kursk (operation &quot;Zittadele&quot;) that took place in 1943 was final German attempt to keep strategic initiative on Eastern front. Germans regained their spirit (crushed after defeat at Stalingrad) after successful recapturing of Kharkov and hoped new powerful tanks Panthers and Tigers allow them to crush Russian defense. It took time to deploy new equipment to the battle which gave Soviets time to prepare deep defenses. On the other side Russian generals planned to slow and weaken attacking German forces and after they have no more offensive power launch Soviet counteroffensive.&#10;&#10;German assault was formed by two pincers - one attacking from the North while the other from the South. German plan was to cut off Soviet forces (5 armies) in Kursk bulge and destroy them. North pincer was a bit weaker and faced much more condense defensive lines which took much more time to break through. Assaulting forces was successfully distracted on July 12th by Soviet offensive to the north of the Kursk salient that was aimed toward Orel - directly at the rear of the assaulting Germans.&#10;&#10;On the south German forces was much more successful. After fierce combats they managed to break Soviet defenses and reached Obojan and Prokhorovka which was last Soviet defense before Kursk. Soviet forces was exhausted and suffered heavy losses during the battle (Soviet 5th Guards Army defending Prokhorovka was 50 tangs out of 650 that it had couple of days before). On July 12th ,although German commander - general Mainstein insisted on final push and break of Soviet defenses, Hitler - impressed by Allied invasion of Sicily and Soviet offensive towards Orel decided to abandon operation &quot;Zittadele&quot;.&#10;&#10;There are many myths that arose around the battle - mainly due to the fact that any real data available was kept confidential for a long time. It is fact that Germans did not break through Soviet lines but from recent historical materials it appears that Germans might have been very close to success. General Mainstein described the battle as German's lost victory - and, at least on the South, it looks like Germans were really close. Also German losses was extremely exaggerated (on July 11 - day of famous battle at Prokhorovka Germans lost around 48 tanks) while Soviet loses was tremendous. It looks like the battle could be won by Germans, but luckily other factors took the spirit of victory from Hitler just in time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From publisher's website :&#10;&#10;&quot;Spring, 1876&#10;&#10;The most formidable army ever assembled on the Great Plains begins to move. The army is comprised of three columns commanded by George Crook, John Gibbon, and Alfred H. Terry. The most renowned American officer of the era, George A. Custer, commands the 7th Cavalry Regiment, its 12 companies organized in 24 sections, its pack of mules and its Arikara scouts. Also on the move are the units of the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry regiments, Crow and Shoshone scouts, riflemen, volunteers, wagons, machine-guns, 19 superior officers and important figures, 108 combat sections, and 30 support units.&#10;&#10;All of this is represented by more than 250 original illustrations in Hoka Hey!&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a story of the Great Plains that takes a decisive turn. The great Indian tribes are included: Hunkpapas, Oglalas, Minneconjous, Sans Arc, Br&ucirc;l&eacute;s, Santee, Two Kettle, Yanktonnais, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Blackfeet.&#10;&#10;At the call of Sitting Bull, a great charismatic chief, 24 tribal chiefs and heroes, including Gall, Crazy Horse, and Lame White Man, assembled 76 groups of warriors. To defend their tipis, their families and their ponies, their way of life and their freedom, they will fight! It&rsquo;s a good day to die!&#10;&#10;More than 200 original drawings represent these Indian tribes who marched against the forces of the United States: Hoka Hey!&#10;&#10;At Honsinger Bluff, on the banks of the Yellowstone River, the first engagement between Sitting Bull and Custer took place on 4 August 1873. A first meeting of the swords that foreshadowed the fighting to come.&#10;&#10;On 9 June 1876, on the banks of the Tongue River, a skirmish showed Crook that the Indians were there and ready to fight!&#10;&#10;On 17 June 1876, the Indians won the first round by repulsing Crook&rsquo;s column at the Rosebud River.&#10;&#10;Finally, near the Little Big Horn from 25-27 June 1876, the Sioux won their greatest victory. Yes, truly, for Custer and 263 of his men, this was a good day to die.&#10;&#10;This first module includes:&#10;&#10;Prelude to the Tragedy: The Battle of Honsinger Bluff, an A2 map and a historical scenario.&#10;&#10;Crook is Repulsed: The Battle of Rosebud, two A2 maps and two scenarios (one of them historical).&#10;&#10;Custer&rsquo;s End: The Battle of the Little Big Horn, one to three A2 maps and 11 scenarios (three of them historical).&#10;&#10;June&rsquo;s Victories: The June 1876 campaign, rules to link the battles of the Rosebud and Little Big Horn.&#10;&#10;Last Warning: The Battle of the Tongue River, an A2 map and two scenarios. (This battle will be sent as a bonus for the first 500 orders.)&#10;&#10;A Good Day to Die: three battles, 15 scenarios.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What it is: A game centered around Viennese dialect. Unplayable if you are not familiar with the German language in general and Viennese dialect in particular.&#10;&#10;Aim of the game: Bribing the attendant of the &quot;G&auml;nseh&auml;ufel&quot; (a forested sand island in the Danube with a large open-air bath) into giving you the last of the almost-sold-out lockers. The player who is first to successfully bribe the attendant wins the game.&#10;&#10;How it is played: To bribe the attendant, one needs to collect three &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; (inn/restaurant cards). These are gained by moving one's player token to the &quot;Wirtshausfelder&quot; (inn/restaurant spaces) on the board. When a player lands on a &quot;Wirtshausfeld&quot;, he has to interpret a &quot;Wuchtel-Karte&quot;. Each of these cards contains a lighthearted comments in Viennese dialect and four sentences in standard German. The active player first tries to interpret the comment. If he is successful, he gets to draw a &quot;Wirtshauskarte&quot;. If not, he may pay 200 &quot;Kaiserm&uuml;hlentaler&quot; (game money) to have one of the four possible translations read to him and to guess if the translation is correct. If he is successful, he gets to draw a card. The &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; have alcoholic strengths printed on them. If the card has the same colour as the player's secret task card, he/she can try to bring it to the attendant to bribe him. But at the bath's entrance, there is a policeman conducting alcohol checks. Depending on the alcoholic strength of the active player's cards, he either has to pay a fine, or the other player/s who initiated the alcohol check have to pay the cost for the check.&#10;Other special fields on the board let players win or lose money (through gambling, staying at the office, selling or auctioning off &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; etc.)&#10;&#10;",
