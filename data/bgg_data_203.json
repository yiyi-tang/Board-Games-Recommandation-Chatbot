    "Description": "It is like dominoes, but with more strategy. The game consists of 24 (playing card) tiles. The tiles are dealt face up, 12 to each player, at the beginning of the game and remain face up for the entire game. Players take turns playing tiles to the board and the player who uses all their tiles first wins.&#10;&#10;Each tile has a one of three different symbols (cross, circle or square) is each of the corners - exactly one card of all possible combinations up to rotation. To legally place a tile on the board it must be placed next at least one other tile and both the symbols along the common edge must match.&#10;&#10;The main strategic aspect comes from the additional rule that if a player places a tile next to two or more tiles (such as in a &quot;corner&quot;) then they get to have another turn (with no limit on extra tuns achieved this way).&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Last Front is a WWII-themed strategy card game in which players try to outbid each other and capture the most territories. There are 162 Cards total in the game that are divided into three decks: the Battle Deck, The Event Deck and the Territory Deck.&#10;&#10;The Battle deck is made up of Unit cards, Special cards and Icon cards. These cards are drawn by the players and used to make their bids.&#10;&#10;Unit cards are divided into four types: Troops, Tanks, Planes and Support. These all have a face value and different ratios within the Battle deck. There are more Troops than anything, but they are much lower value than Tanks or Planes. Support units have two values- a defense value and an attack value. If someone is trying to steal a territory you have captured they can be a powerful deterrent!&#10;&#10;Icon cards feature famous personalities from different nations and they each grant bonuses or special effects based on their role in the war. The famous spy Virginia Hall allows you to see an opponent&rsquo;s hand and swap a card. Patton gives a per-card bonus to Tank units. Vasily Zaytsev and Lyudmilla Pavlichenko are snipers that can take out enemy Icons. &#10; Special cards generally have special rules that can be disruptive to your opponents. Advanced Fighters boost your Plane values. Typhus eliminates all opponent Troops in a display. Blockades can stop an opponent from using any territory bonuses they may have.&#10;&#10;The Territory deck contains territory cards that players bid for in battles. Winning territories not only gets you closer to winning, but players with a controlling share of a territory type get a bonus that is unique to that country. The USSR gets a bonus to Defense cards. Germany gets a bonus for Tanks. &#10;The Event deck contains random events that can have a major impact on how a battle progresses. Fog of War forces all players to swap the cards in their hand with a new draw from the Battle deck. Winter impacts all Unit cards played for the rest of a battle, forcing players to commit more cards to a bid in order to stay in.&#10;&#10;Game play is fairly straightforward. Players make bids to capture territories by placing cards from their hand face up into their display in order to outbid their opponents and capture Territory cards. Bid values consist of the cumulative value of the cards - including any modifiers from Special, Icon or Event cards and Territory bonuses.&#10;&#10;The turn order consists of three parts: &#10;1.    The first player declares battle and draws one card from the battle deck&#10;2.    The first player makes their bid &#10;3.    Next player either exceeds the previous player&rsquo;s bid by at least one point or withdraws from the battle&#10;&#10;Because players only get two opportunities to draw fresh cards &ndash;one at the start of their turn and one when they either win or withdraw- every card is a vital resource. Players that over commit run the risk of leaving themselves open for attack on subsequent battles.  There is an additional &ldquo;digging in&rdquo; rule that allows players to commit cards in piles of 10 points each. This prevents those cards from being affected by other player&rsquo;s burn cards and has the added benefit of cutting down on the amount of math that&rsquo;s required.&#10;&#10;This continues until only one player remains, at which point the territory card is awarded to them and they declare the next battle. Victory conditions are based on the number and type of Territory Cards a player has accumulated. 2 of a kind or 3 different territories will win the game.&#10;&#10;",

This spectre does not distinguish between gods and men, all are crushed beneath the feet of what can only be called...The Cataclysm. Five great beings have formed a Covenant to halt the devastation. Battle rivals to prove that you&rsquo;re a commander that The Five need in order to stop The Cataclysm and earn your place amongst their great champions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The GamePhoenix Covenant is a tactics battle card game that fans have called &quot;like Magic meets Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; - and yes, you can believe them. It's far more than &quot;cards on a board;&quot; there's real strategic depth and you're not subject to mere dice rolls at every critical moment.&#10;&#10;In this universe, you are a great commander trying to prove yourself as the best of them all in a battle of wills. Outmaneuver your foes and create tactical formations by turning your cards, outwit others with well-timed unit abilities, combos and spells, and outplay opponents by taking advantage of our unique special-summoning Commander cards, directional armor and attack system, and built-right-on-the-field structure cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;More DetailsCommander Units allow players to forward-deploy units against opposing forces. While you can use them for their native abilities or attack power, forward-deploying can turn the tide of a battle. Position-based mechanics augment keyword-based and event-based mechanics seen in card games up to now. Some cards grow in power based on their position on the board, others might protect units next to them, and others might deflect enemy attacks.&#10;&#10;The unique square (80mm x 80mm) card units come with a combination of armor and weakpoints. Damage is reduced when a unit is attacked on an armored side, while a unit suffers a critical hit (extra damage) when hit in a weakpoint. You'll need to maneuver and turn your units to attack your enemies' unarmored sides and weakpoints while protecting your own in deadly tactical duels across the game board.&#10;&#10;In the Player vs. Player (PvP) head-to-head mode, you test your tactical and strategic might against everyone at once. Choose your army well, learn spells, and consider constructing powerful structures to support your forces. There is also a 2v2 team battle mode for all out there who want to test their skills while bringing a friend along for the fight!&#10;&#10;A Player vs. Environment (PvE) cooperative mode is under development, and multiple scenarios are being tested. With it, you will play alongside friends and take on missions that The Five require you and other great commanders to complete. You may even be able to design your own scenarios.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You&rsquo;ll also collect that animal tile after using their movement, which you can use for photo cards and bonuses!&#10;&#10;It's a tense back and forth as you and your opponent maneuver for the best positions and the best photos, try to impress the judges, and fight over the best campsites and landmarks. With strategic movement and a variety of ways to score, Yosemite is fast and challenging, keeping you and your opponent on your toes as you explore the beautiful park.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Checkers and chess are classics, but where is the modern twist? tak&bull;tak is today's new two-player strategy board game. tak&bull;tak has simple rules like checkers and the layered strategies of chess. The game uses the familiar grid and 'battlefield' board to allow players to &quot;advance, stack, and attack&quot; chips of matching colors and numbers. While learning to play is quick and easy, it takes a real strategist to win.&#10;&#10;How does it play?&#10;Players take turns moving their pieces across the board one space at a time, either straight ahead or diagonally, into the gray &quot;war zone&quot; with the goal of reaching the other player's safe zone.&#10;&#10;Stack &amp; Attack&#10;While moving across the board, players may stack any of their pieces of the same number or color. These stacks can now move as one piece to get across the board faster. When players meet in the war zone they may attack their opponent's pieces by stacking on any that are the same color or number and absorb them into their own forward moving stack.&#10;&#10;How to win?&#10;Advance the highest numeric value of chips into your opponents safe zone and win tak&bull;tak!&#10;&#10;",

The cards have to be placed adjacent to other cards according to the placing rules. Thus everybody lays out their own supply network and tries to collect planets. A planet can be collected from the supply network if a player builds a new route with the same planet. That means the planet has to be laid out a second (or third or more often) time and then the old planet card(s) have to be taken as victory point(s).&#10;&#10;Every player has got a mission card (with 4 missions) and a top secret card (with 2 tasks). The missions are all the same for each player, for example: &quot;place a planet at the supply network from another player&quot;. This is possible but harder than placing a planet in the own system. It also could hurt the other player but would not destroy his/her whole plan.&#10;&#10;Mission cards are placed open, so every player knows always how much missions the other players have solved. The secret tasks are all different and the players hide them till the end of the game. Only then the players show them and thus the secret tasks could be crucial for determining the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, everything happens under the watchful eye of the Boss, so plan carefully.&#10;&#10;All players draw from the same deck of cards, managing the resources they get to work and rest during their own turn, and interfere with their opponents during the turns of other players. A players actions depend on their Employee type, as it defines their action limit, card draw and hand size. The more you work, the more tired you get, making it harder to complete your tasks without resting to recharge. But while you take a break, other might use the opportunity to hand out their assignments to you, so watch out, and keep a Boss card in hand to defend yourself.&#10;&#10;Overtime is a satirical take on those all to familiar real life situations people regularly experience, but in the form of a fun and competitive race. The clock ticks down the turns, and if no player manages to finish their tasks by midnight, when the 8th turn ends, no one wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Points are scored according to the number of existing pieces in contact with the piece already played, irrespective of color. Additionally, the four corner spaces and the central square are marked with a dot; pieces played over these dots score one extra point.&#10;&#10;Each player has 14 pieces: straights, zig zags, &quot;U&quot; shapes, and corners of varying sizes. The pieces must be placed right side up, which is indicated by a groove carved into the top of the pieces. This often leads to difficult decisions needing to be made as to how to get the majority of your pieces onto the board while maximizing the points scored for each piece and also preventing your opponent from getting his pieces onto the board.&#10;&#10;Scoring is recorded using wooden pegs and one track for each player with 0-9 &amp; 0-50 holes in the border of the board. For each piece left at the end of the game, two points are deducted from a player's score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Adventure and glory await you in Pieces of Eight, the rousing combat game of rival buccaneer ships on the high seas. You play the game with a stack of metal pirate coins held in one hand that represents your ship. The coins you choose and the order in which you place them determine your ship's strengths, and you use the special abilities of your coins to destroy your opponent's coins one by one. Your goal is to expose the Captain coin buried deep in the middle of your adversary's ship, then take him out!&#10;&#10;Dare to enter the age of blood and gold with either The Blade or The Maiden's Vengeance ship set. Each set includes all the coins needed for one player to construct his own ship. Your opponents will each need their own ship set to play, but there's no other limit to the number of players who can join in. The coins in each set are not randomized; you can combine ship sets to gain a wider selection of coins and the advantage over your foes.&#10;&#10;From the Atlas Games website.&#10;&#10;",

They form two teams and with the help of a garden hose that they place under a fence, the gnomes organize a Tug-of-War. They shout, moan, swear, and insult each other. Sweat streams down in large drops from under their gnomish hats. They try to pull together at the fence. Squirrels from the neighborhood hurry to gather there. They can&rsquo;t sleep with all the noise and they gather at the garden's edge in order to watch the spectacle.&#10;&#10;Garden dwarves make a &quot;pull the rope&quot; competition. During his turn, each player plays a card which allows him to add a dwarf of a certain color on his side of the rope or to make dwarves of a particular color stronger (or weaker). When dwarves are actually pulling the rope, you slide a part of the cute little board.&#10;&#10;",

Each move is supposed to keep possible the ability to eventually form an expression equal to the goal, but it must not be possible to form such an expression immediately if there are still cubes remaining in the resources pile. Players may challenge each other if they believe a move has rendered impossible any expression that equals the goal, or if an expression can be formed prematurely. When a challenge is issued, all other players decide which side they want to be on. The side claiming that an expression is possible, has the burden of proof to create such an expression. The final expression must use all the Required cubes, none of the Forbidden cubes, and as many Permitted cubes as desired. Expressions are written down; the cubes are not moved. Parentheses may be inserted as desired. Rounds continue until some agreed condition is met (high score reached, or number of rounds).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the beginning of the game each player receives a different set of picture tiles. To start a round, a theme is shown, e.g. &quot;Women like it...&quot; Everyone thinks about this and selects a tile from his set, but does not show it to the other players. Players lay their tiles picture-side down on the table, and these tiles are mixed up with random tiles from the stock.&#10;&#10;On the board there are slots which are numbered from 0 to 6. Tiles are placed next to slot 3 so that everyone can see the pictures. The goal for each player is to have his tile reach the top (slot 6) of the ranking of items that best meet the requirement. Each player receives points equal to the slot number where his tile is at the end of each round. The point total is reduced if another player correctly guesses which tile belongs to whom and marks it with the player's color.&#10;&#10;When it is your turn, choose two tiles in the same row/slot and compare them to one another in meeting the requirement of the theme. (Important: You can only compare two tiles in the same row. If there is only one tile in row 4, you cannot compare this tile to one in a different row!)&#10;For example, say, &quot;I think women like lipstick more than a car.&quot; Then, you move the lipstick tile up one row and the car tile down one row. After you have done that, the others can guess your tile, by placing a stone of your color on any tile. Each player has only one stone of each color and can only guess the active player, so this must be done selectively and timely!&#10;&#10;The round ends when one tile reaches the 6 slot and another is in the 0. Then, you calculate the points. Each player gets points equal his slot, minus every correct guess stone on the tile. So, if your tile is in slot 4, but there are 2 correct color stones are on it, you get only 2 points (4 - 2 = 2).&#10;&#10;Before the beginning of the next round everyone gets a new picture tile from the stock and a new theme is shown.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 15 points after a round ends the game and is the winner. He is the RanKING.&#10;&#10;",

The first to arrive, and thus to claim the better G0 system, were those of Islamic origin . . . The second mission, of Chinese origin, arrived some 50 years later, in a crippled colony ship . . . they found [the G0 system] jealously guarded by a handful of Islamic ships, and had to crash-land instead in the far poorer quality red dwarf system. This early incident left a lasting animosity between the two cultures . . . Over two centuries, the Islamic culture established itself in its system, exploiting its mineral and ecological wealth to the fullest, and developing a thriving interplanetary society. The Chinese colony, on the other hand, was forced to spend the past 150 years in a spartan struggle for survival against marginal environments and the unpredictable flares of [the red dwarf] . . .  Now, however, the pressure of population on the Chinese and the pressure for additional resource supplies on the Islamic has brought these two cultures into direct conflict.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes on the role of an author attempting to construct the best story in the world of Oz. During the game, players will attempt to bring together objects, characters and locations that are appropriate together &ndash; for example, the Tin Woodman and his Oil Can &ndash; while avoiding hazards like the field of poppies and terrible beasts and villains like the Kalidahs or the Wicked Witch of the West.&#10;&#10;Each round players roll a special set of dice to determine the number of points they have for drawing and playing cards. The number of dice increases during the game, allowing the game to scale naturally while you play. The game ends when a player is able to move a Prime character &ndash; that is, one of the main characters of the story &ndash; from her Title card all the way to The End, but doing so is no simple race because the character who triggers the endgame is worth no points toward victory.&#10;&#10;Featuring hundreds of fascinating characters, events, and vistas, Oz is a world that has stood the test of time.

And the aim of the players is to reduce each track to zero and thereby meeting the climate target and winning the game. A deck of mission gives the players their missions that they need work together on to reduce the emissions. The actions they are able to perform comes from three separate resource card decks; Finances, Discipline and Commitment. These resource cards act as a currency in the game and also provide different actions the players can take. The players use action pawns to take any of the three possible actions: Take a card, Take 3 cards for two action pawns or Play a card.&#10;&#10;All players need to cooperate using their character&rsquo;s unique abilities and the actions provided by the resource cards. The household cannot rely one just one player to win the game for them but instead the household needs to collectively agree on their strategy and which actions they need to take to be able to complete the environmental missions and thereby reducing the emissions to zero and thereby they all win! If they don't manage to reduce them down to zero before the end of the 5th round time has run out and they all lost. Then they can try again in a new residence, with a different lifestyle and with different characters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players move their pieces across the spaces on the map and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces, seize critical objectives, and change the Netwar Index, which is an index used to indicate how successful each side has been in meeting their goals. Furthermore, one unique feature of the Holy Land is that as units engage in combat, their effectiveness may increase or decrease as they gain experience in fighting, or become demoralized.&#10; The game map shows Israel and adjoining countries, divided into large rectangular boxes known as regions, representing the general geography of the area.

In the first, players use the tiles to create a jungle in which there are a number of continuous and broken paths. Each player claims the junction on each card they lay down using their colored counters.&#10;2. In the second phase, players race to be the first to remove all their counters from the jungle by following the continuous paths to the outside&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;Basically, the first phase is like playing Carcassonne, you lay a tile you put a man on the junction. (surprise?). Then every player tries to move the men out following the quickest route. One move, one tile. Blocking is important in this game.&#10;&#10;",

Our witches are vegetarian and real!&#10;&#10;Legend says that in a lagoon of Cern&eacute;gula, a town in Burgos, a coven of witches had their meetings. In The Witches of Cern&eacute;gula, you must become the witch who cooks the best and most potions. Collect the required herbs, but these are not always available, so think well about your actions! Cook in your cauldron elaborate recipes and master one or more magic arts. Become the most experienced witch and earn points to prove it!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game consists of several rounds divided into two phases:&#10;&#10;&bull; Herb collection: In order to collect herbs, move your cauldron located inside your herb board, so that the ladle, the carrot leaves, and the snake head point to the herbs you want to collect. The players must take all the corresponding tokens according to the placement of their cauldrons, but they cannot store more than three green tokens per type of herb. If you had to place more than three green tokens on an herb, place red tokens from the common supply instead. Each red token near the board equals 2 negative points at the end of the game. The red tokens are permanent: they are still red even if the player has fewer than three green tokens on the herb.&#10;&#10;&bull; Potions preparation: During this optional phase, you can prepare one or more available potions as either complete or incomplete potions. In addition, once you have made the potion, you can perform the ability immediately or in another time, as the card indicates.&#10;&#10;Using potions' abilities costs victory points. After using the ability of a potion card, turn it 90&ordm; to indicate it's been used. At the end of the game, the value of turned potions cards is subtracted from your victory points.&#10;&#10;",

This also changes how some events play out.&#10;&#10;Caching Area Cards&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; This is the most randomizing factor in the game. However, Map cards and the ability to look at some of the cards reduces the &ldquo;randomness&rdquo; of landing on a card. If you know what is out there you can prepare for it.&#10;&#10;Characters&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; The Character that you play changes the strategy that you use. If you have the Puzzler, you may wish to go right out into the Caching area before heading to the Sporting Goods Store.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; The other Characters that are in play change your approach. If the Coin Collector is on the board you may want to wait to go to the Geocaching Mega Event until he or she has left the area.&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Cards are drawn at random, but you make meaningful choices each time. Deciding which piece of Equipment that you would like to activate will be based on your Character&rsquo;s abilities, other Characters, what Caching Area cards you know are out there, and the general strategy that you chose to take.&#10;&#10;Event Cards&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Some Event Cards have immediate effects, this is a random effect.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Other Event Cards can be saved to be used during your turn or at any time. Deciding when to use these cards and what cards you have will change each time you play.&#10;&#10;GeoCoin  Goals&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Each Geocoin has a goal that triggers its point value. Do you chase after a cache or do you go after the Geocoin&rsquo;s goal?&#10;&#10;",

The opponents cards of this type must then be placed onto the deposit pile. &#10;    Pick up cards from a row. You take all the cards of a single type from either end of any row and add them to your hand, then place the card in the row adjacent to these cards (and all cards of the same type) in the scoring area.&#10;    Place one card from your hand at the end of a row.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a row is emptied, create a new row of ten cards from the deck.

The Zulu player is on the offensive, attempting to wipe out the entire British force on the map as quickly as possible. The British is attempting to win by having some remnant hold out longer than occurred historically or, alternatively, by having some portion of his command escape off the map and get back to relative safety at Roarke&rsquo;s drift. Solitaire-play is easily doable. Each game turn of Last Stand is equal to five to 20 minutes of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the tempo of action in each turn. Each hexagon on the 22x34&rdquo; map represents 217 yards (200 meters) from side to opposite side. There are 176 5/8&rdquo; counters with each British unit-counter representing a company or a &ldquo;detachment&rdquo; of infantry. On the Zulu side, they individual units each represent temporary battlefield agglomerations of the about 100 to 200 warriors.&#10;&#10;Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #314&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lemur Tails is a two player card game where you try to create the longest tails by alternating black and white tail cards. The longer the tail, the better. Sounds easy enough, but you both create two tails and win if your shorter tail is longer than that of your opponent. So use the numbered tail cards to create two long tails and strategically use the joker cards and the sun worshipping lemurs. Only when you combine these factors, can you create the longest short tail and win.&#10;&#10;So how does it work?&#10;Every player has two lemurs, both of which have their own tail (of course). The aim of the game is to extend both these tails by adding tail cards. In your turn you can therefore add tail cards or you could use sun worshipping Lemurs for special abilities, or you can do both.&#10; When you want to extend a tail, you need alternate between black and white cards and have the right number on the tail card. You can only add a tail card that is +1, -1 or the same number as the previous card (and it has to be the opposing color).&#10;&#10;When you want to use sun worshipping Lemurs, you need to make sure you actually have them. You start with two, and can get more by adding at least three tails cards at once to a tail. Now what special abilities do these Lemurs have? They will allow you to take a card from the open market, take the last card from the tail of your opponent, take a random card from the hand of your opponent or discard and replace up to three of your hand cards.&#10;&#10;There are also joker cards that can be used, where only the color has to be correct.&#10;&#10;The key notion to keep in mind, is that you win by having the longest shortest tail. So don&rsquo;t focus on one tail but extend both of them for the win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card containing a letter is turned over. The active player proposes a word starting with this letter then, if he wishes it, turns over a new card and must propose a new word starting with the first turned over letter and containing the new letter. He proceeds, as long as he feels able to include the next letter.&#10;Of course, if you cannot find a word containing all the letters, you do not have to turn a new card over.&#10;If the active player decides to stop, the other players can try to do better while drawing a new letter at their turn...&#10;&#10;When you are the last to propose a word, you gain all cards including the same symbol. When the game ends, the player who has the most cards is declared the Winner.&#10;&#10;",
