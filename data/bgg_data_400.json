Select and discard pairs of cards of the same rank.  Both cards of the pair should be adjacent in a row, a diagonal, or a column.  &#10;2. After discarding all possible pairs, move the remaining cards from right to left and from bottom to top to fill the empty spaces. &#10;3. Deal additional cards from the stock pile to bring the number of cards back to 25. &#10;4. Repeat until no possible pairs can be matched.&#10;&#10;The amount of cards remaining counts as your minus score.  The game is won if the entire deck is discarded by pairs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Sceptered Isle consists of 4 battles of the Wars of the Roses. Towton, Mortimer's Cross, Barnet and Tewkesbury.&#10;&#10;It uses an evolution of the system from his pre-gunpowder quads published through 3W (Age of Chivalry, Crusades, Sword & Shield, Henry V, Crusades II). The command system has been changed to accommodate leader character - leaders are rated as aggressive, controlled, or timid, and are likely to gravitate to an order stance that is in keeping with their character as the battle unfolds. Correct exploitation of their capability in the battle plan is important for victory.  The melee and fire combat mechanics are also quite different from the other games in the series.&#10;&#10;The counters are nicely done, icons. The maps are DTP standard. Best of all, the rules are short, counters few, and you can set up and play and finish in an hour.&#10;&#10;",

Players can choose to attack or defend, and the first player whose deck is exhausted or who runs out of immunity points loses the game.&#10;&#10;Called Battle Cells Game Cards, the cards do not involve mystical beings or suits like diamonds and spades. &#10;.Instead, they are adorned with pictures of viruses, pathogens and pills, along with facts and the classification of the each organism.&#10;The cards were developed by a biotech company and a team of Raffles Institution students who have decided that that there are others ways to learn life sciences aside from textbooks and stacks of notes.&#10;First conceptualised by Genecet Biotechnologies, a leading biotech company that provides education in life sciences to schools, the prototype was then passed to the RI students &mdash;Melvyn Kee, Hoe Si En, Nicholas Leong and Tan Ee Kuan &mdash; to improve on.&#10;.Said Genecet Senior Manager Mr Jeffrey Lee: &quot;Being students, the RI boys had a different perspective on the game, because we as adults don't really know what they would enjoy.&quot;&#10;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a Stratego-like game that's actually two games, an army game and a navy game.  Pieces are set up on a board in a manner similar to Stratego, but rather than being linear (numerical values), the units have a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  i.e. the tank unit is superior to infantry and engineers but is inferior to aircraft, artillery, and mine units.&#10;&#10;For those who want to recreate the (army) game, the pieces are as follows:  Private, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant = 3 each.  Second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, 1, 2, 3, and 4 star generals = 1 each. Tanks=2, plane=1, Anti-aircraft/anti-tank=5. Mines=6, Engineers=6. A-Bomb=1.&#10;&#10;Infantry take each other according to rank; infantry also takes anti-aircraft/anti-tank and engineers.  Tanks and planes take infantry and engineers. Plane takes tank, anti-aircraft/anti-tank takes planes and tanks, engineers take mines without damage.  Mines are stationary pieces that explode and destroy anything that triggers it except an engineer. The A-Bomb is essentially a movable mine that destroys every piece in a surrounding square when it explodes.&#10;&#10;The pieces are like mah jongg tiles arranged so that the opponent cannot see what kind they are -- he just sees blank pieces advancing toward him. When a piece is attacked or attacks, it is turned over so that the face is visible.  It then becomes a known piece for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;We played the game in Hawaii in elementary school in the late 1950s.  There were two blank pieces included, presumably in case a piece got lost.  We sometimes used these to create two additional pieces, the brainwasher and the kamikaze.  The kamikaze was simply a flying bomb.  The brainwasher changed an opponent's piece into one of your own.  It was not possible to brainwash the A-Bomb.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Space Barons&nbsp;is a quick game of delivering commodities across a distant galaxy.&#10;&#10;Inventory: map showing star systems and connections between them; rocket ship pawns, home base and transporter markers, and galactic credits (money). The game is driven by a deck of rather silly delivery cards. There is a deck of insurance policy cards (in the event of disasters). And a six-sided die.&#10;&#10;Players begin by selecting a spaceship dealer or dealers and rolling the six-sided die, then paying for their spaceship. They then build and pay for their home base (which doubles as a permanent transporter), selecting a star system from the map. Each star system has a cost to build, ranging from 10-50, which indicates the value and frequency of deliveries that can be made to that system.&#10;&#10;Play is relatively simple. On each turn, players draw one delivery card, which usually specifies a cargo and three destinations, varying in value. The cargo is automatically available at the system where the player's rocket pawn is located. The player may then deliver that cargo to the best possible destination (if any is possible). Deliveries may only be made to star systems connected by the players. Upon arrival at a system specified by their card, players are paid for the cargo.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on arrival at a system. However, to depart from a system a player must possess a matter transporter at that system, or pay another player to rent their transporter. If no transporter is present, the player must build one on a later turn in order to move.&#10;Random events are included in the delivery deck. Some of these can result in loss of spaceship or transporter, or devaluing of cargo. A player may buy an insurance policy, partially covering the cost of losing a ship or transporter.&#10;&#10;The delivery deck has a reshuffle card. Upon reshuffling, an end-of-game card is added to the delivery deck. The length of play can be altered by choosing where and when to shuffle these two cards into the deck. The player with the most money when the end-of-game card is revealed wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The complete box includes also a couple of spare cards, some measurement cards that can be used to measure the size of your ear, and a c-cassette containing sound effects from the cards.&#10;&#10;A single round of this game begins by dealing each player a certain amount of cards (10 - 16) depending on the number of players - more cards with less players. On each round every player has two goals: to get rid of all his/her cards, and to collect sets of 3+ colored cards with a same text.&#10;&#10;During each round The first player who manages to empty his/her hand wins the round but isn't necessarily the player who receives the most points. That's because the most points are awarded from the collected sets. The winner, however, receives bonus points according to the cards still left in the hands of other players and other players get a lot of penalty from those cards. There is also a 100 point bonus awarded for a player who wins the round with only a single set on the board.&#10;&#10;The game is played over multiple rounds which all are scored. The winner is the player who first reaches 500 points. Because the amount of points gained from a round can vary from -150 to +450 the games can last forever or only for less than an hour.&#10;&#10;The fun part of the game is that when a player plays a card he/she must say what's printed in the card, like: &quot;Splappa dap!&quot;, &quot;Arra Argh Yargh&quot;, or &quot;Fippaditty Fappaditty Fappa daMap!&quot; It comes naturally after a few games, believe me.&#10;&#10;",

Most systems were centered around this element of the army. Battles such as Hastings tended to confirm their supremacy. By the fourteenth century there appeared in various nations trained infantrymen in numbers greater than previously hitherto. Battles such as Courtrai and Crecy were the first of many battles in which the infantry were to play increasingly decisive roles. Thus we see how the feudal system of castles and knights gave way to missiles and trained infantry. By 1500 gunpowder weapons were establishing a supremacy of their own, subsequent armies became balanced professional forces which are outside the scope of these rules.&quot;&#10;&#10;Lance is a set of medieval 25mm miniature gaming rules that provides melee and ranged weapon attacks, terrain effects, leader rules, visibility and detection, unit formations, and morale.&#10;&#10;",

Some cards take the player to treasure hunting, which means a lot of money. Some other cards may contain trivia question which can be very tricky - especially if Pietarsaari region is unknown. By answering a correctly to the question the player earns some money, and with a wrong answer the money must be paid.&#10;&#10;Players decide together how much initial money is given and when does the game end. Therefore the game can be played as long - or short - as the players want to. The winner is the player whose fortune is the most valuable at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, children and adults are asked safety questions and parents are encouraged to help the child get the correct answer. The child is rewarded with Lifesaver tokens for each correct answer. They could win a penny, five cents, a hug, a &quot;stay up 1/2 later&quot; token, etc. Honoring the tokens makes the family fun last long after the game is over.

It&rsquo;s all explained in the instruction booklet, which illustrates how to play each game.  Gameplay is kind of a mix of Skittle Pool, Zig Zag Zoom, and Rebound or Bumper Shot.&#10;&#10;There is a cool little marble-shooter gadget and marbles, of course.  There are other gadgets and equipment, too: tenpins for bowling games, a triangular pin-setting device, a spinner device and an abstract clown used as challenging obstacles during play, and a sidelines bat for baseball-type games.  Any number of people can play&mdash;including solo (which isn&rsquo;t much fun, however)&mdash;but Smack-A-Roo is best suited for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;",

The central piece of the game is a clock with an arrow that starts at 12 o'clock, and than starts moving clock-wise, taking exactly an hour for one turn. Surrounding the clock are tiles that are face down at the start of the game, but that are turned up during the game (showing colorful pictures of nature) if the players succeed in answering trivia questions about environmental topics. The clock-arrow indicates how well the players are doing because if the tile-turning is ahead of the arrow the players are doing well, but if they are behind they are in trouble!&#10;Other trouble for the players comes from wrong answers, because after a wrong answer a red card has to be turned over, which may mean that the Greenpeace ship is blocked. In case of a blockade progress on the dial is stopped (but the clock moves on!). Luckily good answers not only turn over tiles, but also give players green card that they can use to remove blockades.&#10;The game is cooperative because everyone wins if the last tile is turned over, and everyone loses when the clock runs out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Victory at Sea is a set of privately published miniatures rules from 1971. The rules simulate ship-to-ship tactical combat from 1898 to about 1970. Compared to more recent rules sets, these rules are almost just an outline. The heart of the rules are several sets of charts for gunnery, torpedoes and movement.&#10;The to-hit system uses a 2D6 roll compared to a chart that gives &quot;chances per 36&quot; for a hit.&#10;There are three scenarios included: Coronel, 1914; River Plate, 1939 and Denmark Straits, 1941. A photocopy sheet has 1:1200 ship plans to cut out for those who don't have miniatures.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Literally meaning &lsquo;Soldier Shogi&rsquo;, Gunjin Shogi is not really related to Shogi other than by having a military theme and pentagonal pieces. The game is more similar to Army Chess (Lu Zhan Jun Qi) or Stratego, featuring hidden pieces and a hierarchical system of combat, where higher ranked pieces defeat lower ones: the objective is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s flag. Like Army Chess, Gunjin Shogi requires a third person to act as umpire and resolve combat. Unlike Army Chess (and more like Hai Lu Kong Jun Qi), Gunjin Shogi includes planes and tanks.&#10;&#10;Each player has 23 pieces, consisting of a flag, 12 officers, 2 planes, 2 tanks, a cavalry unit, two engineers, a spy and two land mines. There is a hierarchy of ranks, with some exceptions &ndash; planes naturally cannot be destroyed by land mines and engineers deactivate land mines, for instance.&#10;&#10;The game dates to at least before the second world war (I base this on an incomplete pre-war set I was shown in an antique shop in Japan).&#10;&#10;",

The zone of the 16th was south of the highway, and along the Smolensk-Minsk Railroad. They were reinforced with the following units: 148th Tank Regiment (PT mineroller tanks), 63rd Guards Heavy Tank Regiment (KVs), 517th Tank Regiment (FT tanks), elements of several Self-Propelled Artillery Regiments, 2nd Guards Assault Engineer-Sapper Brigade, as well as numerous towed artillery units. The Soviet forces trained as a combined arms team prior to the attack, and were well prepared. In most sectors of Army Group Center, the Germans had relatively thin lines, and most armor and heavy artillery was stripped to defend expected areas of attack. The area of the highway had seen much heavy fighting in the winter of 1943-44, and the Germans expected an attack to come in this direction. When German intelligence detected the buildup of artillery and armored forces, as well as the movement of ammunition, their reaction was to ensure forces in this area retained significant combat strength. The 78th Sturm Division, already the most powerful &lsquo;infantry&lsquo; division in Army Group Center, maintained its structure which included the 189th Assault Gun Battalion (StuG), a Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion (PzJgIII/IVs), 5th Nebelwerfer Battalion (120mm Mortars), and Army Antiaircraft Battalion 293 (mix of 88s/20s). These forces defended from probably the most dense network of mines, trenches, and bunkers in Army Group Center, including special rotating bunkers housing machine-guns.&#10; Years of extensive on-sight research along with vigorous play testing by the veteran game designers at Heat of Battle brings you ONSLAUGHT TO ORSHA.&#10; ONSLAUGHT TO ORSHA contains:&#10;&#10;* Color 29x56&quot; historical map featuring 1&quot; hexes of the Smolensk-Minsk Railroad area&#10;    * Chapter OtO, that includes rules for new units, terrain types and vehicle notes&#10;    * Campaign Game, 22 scenarios and 2 Solitaire Missions&#10;    * 17 Page Map Study and Order of Battle&#10;    * And, over 180 new, full color counters covering vehicles and weapons not seen in an tactical wargame system are included for free!&#10;&#10;",
