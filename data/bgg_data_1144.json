These Side Quests can be attempted at lower levels than the intended difficulty recommends for an even hard challenge.&#10;&#10;Each Bounty Pack adds a side quest that can be attempted during specific moments of the Adventure Mode. The Bounties of Elenia line of Bounty Packs represent all of the horrible monstrosities that threaten the realms of Elenia.&#10;&#10;Each Bounty Pack contains a plethora of new content. New tokens, a new Bounty Book, new miniatures, new tiles that expand old sets, new unique loot, new upgrades, as well as optional content to change the possible combatants that might spawn in the Unintentional Malum Core Game and Adventure Expansions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lead the people of one of the four towns in a post-apocalyptic world. Complete secret objectives and compete against other players, for example find the Patient Zero, take him to the Research Center and save the world while making sure your citizens don't get infected and turn Zombie. Or intentionally get some of your people infected and direct a zombie herd to your opponents&rsquo; towns to disrupt their plans.&#10;&#10;In this roll and move game there are 5 secret missions that are given out randomly among the 2 - 4 players.  Each player will try and accomplish their mission to win all the while trying to prevent being turned into a zombie.&#10;&#10;THE MECHANICS:  a turn consists of 3-Steps: Produce (rolling a pair of dice), Move (up to 3 movements of 1 hex (w/an exception of the type of piece being moved), and Attack (either zombies in the area or other players).  These actions must be done in this order.   UNLESS a 7 is rolled, then infection spreads fast and pieces on the board, depending on their location, might turn into zombies and players lose control of their pieces in this event.  These mechanics will be repeated until a player accomplishes their secret mission or all players have turned into zombies at which point everyone loses.&#10;&#10;THE AREA BOARD:  A 12 X 12 hexagonal grid with each hexagonal space representing different topographies and symbols that provide provide benefits or introduce restrictions.  The board is also marked with grid areas designating areas of cities and buildings.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:  All of the areas and hexagonal spaces of the board are utilized in conjunction with the secret missions.  Upon roll of the dice, the production phase begins and players decide on their tactics according to the secret mission they were given at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;ATTACKS:   Attacks are optional and are resolved by dice role.  Depending on the number of units (maximum of three), dice are rolled and an attacking roll of 4, 5 or 6 is considered a hit while a 6 rolled by the defender is considered a successful defense with the defender winning any ties.&#10;&#10;THE GOAL:  Avoid being annihilated by other players or turned into a zombie and be the first to complete your secret mission.&#10;&#10;",

Players are a staff of an apparel shop. They import and sell outfits, while predicting or making everchanging trends.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing a garment card onto 3x3 grid. The card must be placed adjacent to a card which shares at least one attribute. When three cards of the same attribute make a line, a trend is made, such as red-color trend or denim trend.

    "Description": "Bravely in their Battles! is a moderately complex tabletop board game of Medieval Age pitched battles. Units are depicted with 2.5&rdquo; wide playing pieces, and battles occur on an area grid map.&#10;&#10;Terrain tiles allow the battlefields to be customized to match historical terrain. In addition, a number of smaller playing pieces represent leaders and various status effects that are placed on the map or units.&#10;&#10;Hastings 1066 depicts the hard-fought battle between William, the Duke of Normandy, and English Saxon king Harold Godwinson on October 14th at Senlac Hill in southern England.&#10;&#10;Agincourt 1415 depicts the annihilation of a large army of French men at arms by English King Henry V and his elite longbowmen on October 25th near Azincourt, France.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Who will help the most mice escape?&#10;&#10;Cat &amp; Mouse is a simple memory game full of tumbling fun. &#10;At the start of the game cover all orange, blue, black, and white mice with the red buckets. On a player's turn, they press their finger on one of the buckets and slide it to the edge so that the mice inside falls through one of the holes. If the color of the hole matches the mouse's color then it is a success and that player can keep the bucket.&#10;&#10;If the mouse has a different color, then that mouse goes back on the cheese, covered by the bucket, and the cat is placed on top.&#10;&#10;Buckets with the cat on top can not be moved until the cat is moved to another bucket.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all mice (except the one with the cat on it) have left the cheese. The player who has the most buckets wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Can one envisage a system of progression of the heroes in the form of experience, of cosmetics as in the video games, or then in a narrative frame retracing multiple choice paths, like a book of which you are the hero ?&#10;&#10;The SpaceCowboys' thinking around this &quot;Experience&quot; box is to allow players to appropriate the adventure of Time Travelers as they see fit.&#10;&#10;If you are inspired and attracted to the theme of a particular scenario, you can dive as usual, discover its secrets and mysteries, experience a thrilling adventure and tidy the box. The unique use remains within the reach of those who feel closer to the theme of a scenario than the history of the game.&#10;&#10;With &quot;Experience&quot;, it is rather the players eager to deepen their knowledge of the Lore of TS, its characters, history in the stories, which are targeted.&#10;&#10;The best part of all this is that the box &quot;Experience&quot; seems to be able to adapt to our progress when we decide to use it, regardless of the order of the scenarios already played or the one from which we go. get it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Until the Bitter End - US Airborne, a World War 2 wargame. This is the second game in the series and a print and play game for solitaire and two-players. This is a standalone game in my series of WW2 print and play games. You don't need to have played the first game - everything is included (you simply need to print it all out and need a regular six sided dice and a pencil).&#10;&#10;The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a game and requires very little space.&#10;&#10;A print and play WW2 wargame for two players and solitaire that takes around half an hour to setup and play.&#10;&#10;The game sets a small squad of US Airborne against their German enemies in a series of small skirmish scenarios. The game's counters (or chits) each represent an actual soldier with the gameplay being in the thick of man-to-man combat.&#10;&#10;The game can be played 2-player with one player playing as the US Airborne and the other player playing as the Germans. The game can also be played Solitaire with the player playing as the US Airborne against the German AI. For gamers familiar with Solitaire wargames this game uses a random chit-pull mechanic (as detailed in the video).&#10;&#10;The game is played in a number of Turns. In each Turn the player(s) randomly picks a Pull Chit from the mug and activate their Infantry. The Game Turn ends when all the Pull Chits have been removed from the cup.&#10;&#10;The player whose Pull Chit this force belongs to can now Activate one Infantry Counter. In activating the Infantry Counter the player can choose from several Actions such as Firing against the enemy, moving, charging into close combat, applying first aid, or attempting to fix a jammed weapon.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple and effective without needing buckets of dice. Players must establish range, line of sight and any modifiers. &#10;Close combat is particularly brutal and decisive with the playing be able to declare charges into combat.&#10;Snap Fire is a defensive fire mechanic where your Infantry Counters can fire on moving enemy counters.&#10;&#10;Finally, the game features a unique mechanic in the shape of Bravery Points.

    "Description": "On September 25th 2020, the domestic terrorist group known as &ldquo;The Watchers&rdquo; kidnapped a diplomat&rsquo;s wife and is holding her ransom.  They demand the release of several of their members from prison before they let her go.  An informant has told the authorities where she is located and the FBI&rsquo;s Special Weapons and Tactics team has been ordered to rescue her and bring the terrorists to justice.  Little do they know, but the media has tipped off the terrorists and they have a surprise waiting for the S.W.A.T. Team.&#10;&#10;In this game, the terrorists setup by placing the hostage in a building with two guards.  They then write down where their hidden sniper and mine will be placed. After this, they roll to see how many terrorist rifleman they will have and place them on the map.  The sniper is a hidden unit and is not placed on the map until he fires or a unit moves adjacent to him.&#10;&#10;The S.W.A.T. forces initially enter in truck from the West and East end of the map.  During their first turn one of their trucks will run over the hidden mine and the truck will be destroyed and the occupants must roll saves to see if they survive.  The S.W.A.T. forces have one additional unit that can enter on any turn in a helicopter.  If the helicopter lands adjacent to any terrorist unit (including the hidden sniper) it will be shot down.&#10;&#10;During the game, the S.W.A.T. forces will battle the terrorists and possibly try to arrest some of them.  Arrest attempts are dangerous and the S.W.A.T. unit can be killed in the process.  Once the S.W.A.T. team eliminates any terrorists guards holding the hostage, they can move in and take control of her.  They then need to transport her off map either on foot, in a truck or with the helicopter.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either the hostage is rescued or all the S.W.A.T. team members are killed.  Victory points are then calculated to see which side won and what level of victory they achieved.&#10;&#10;This game is designed for 2 players, but plays fairly well solitaire.  Most games last around 25 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In order to do so, each outlaw must bring three items needed for the robbery. To keep their dastardly plan a secret, however, the gang can only communicate with each other via Morse Code.&#10;&#10;Each player receives three item cards; these are the items that they need to bring to the gang's hideout. The train's initial distance to the tunnel is determined by the sum value of all players' cards.&#10;&#10;During their turn, each player rolls the four 'transmission' dice, using the resulting Morse Code dot/dash combination to form one or more letters of items on the map. Once an item's word has been spelt, any player needing that item can go to that locale and take it, immediately gaining its benefit.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player moves from one locale to another on the map, or is unable to use all four of the transmission dice, the train moves one click closer to the tunnel. If the odometer on the train reaches zero before all the outlaws arrive in the hideout with their three items, it escapes! The gang also has to contend with a troublesome Sheriff, who puts outlaws in jail, and Indians who will barter for items before you can get them!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Whether baker, banker, teacher or housewife, these brave civilian men and women showed that resistance was not futile, rallying under the flag with the Croix de Lorraine. With less training and equipment than regular forces, and scrounging whatever they could, the Maquis carried out a shadow war on many fronts: printing and distributing underground propaganda, sabotaging enemy networks, aiding Allied pilots who had crashed behind enemy lines, and sending valuable intelligence to the British, risking their lives and retaliation, until France was finally liberated in December 1944.&#10;&#10;Warfighter WWII: Expansion - #46 Maquis features Resistance fighters with missions and skills which reflect their methods of guerilla warfighting, with scrounged-up weapons and gear, stealthy movement, and unconventional objectives.

Seventy nine Squadrons of Fighters and Medium Bombers flew overhead in support of the Raiders.&#10;&#10;Shortly before 5am, the Allied forces charged ashore onto the 6 beaches on and surrounding the Fishing Port in the Town of Dieppe. Alert and waiting for the Allied forces stood the men of the German 302nd Static Infantry Division. The ensuing 6 hours of Battle saw the Allied forces fight with Bravery in the face of determined German defenders.&#10;At the end of the day, over 4000 Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen were dead or wounded. From the Canadians alone, 1946 Soldiers were marched into captivity, their Bravery and Courage was established on that fateful morning and the lessons learnt from this Disaster gave the Allied planners the necessary knowledge and tactics which would lead to successful invasion in Normandy in June 1944 two years later.&#10;&#10;For those player who are history buffs and wargamers you have all the necessary components to script out the desperate actions that occured between the 2nd Canadian Division, the Commandos and the 302nd Static Division of the occupying German forces on the beaches on or near the fishing port of Dieppe in France in the early hours of the 19th of August 1942.

The Japanese defenders were dug into well-entrenched underground bunkers and natural cave systems on the island, and even though the Americans had numerical, logistical and aerial supremacy, a high price was paid for the hard-won victory. In the iconic photo of the six Marines raising a flag over Mount Suribachi, three were killed in action days after, testament to the ferocity of the fighting.&#10;&#10;Warfighter WWII Expansion - #53 Iwo Jima  presents new subterranean locations with close-quarter impediments (such as locked doors and booby traps), along with new soldiers and skills focussed on built-up area combat, reflecting the indomitable fortitude of the US Marines over the five-week campaign as they rooted out the enemy from tunnels and holes.&#10;&#10;This set adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Missions!

It was the first major battle fought by regular US and UK troops, with regular Iraqi troops, against the Islamic Army of Iraq, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and several other insurgent groups, to capture and secure the city. Over six weeks from November to December 2004, Coalition forces became involved in some of the fiercest urban combat against Islamist forces, pushing them back house by house, street by street, frequently encountering prepared obstacles and improvised explosives, with heavy casualties on both sides, as well as civilians.&#10;&#10;This expansion captures the high-intensity conflict faced by US and UK forces, with challenging new built-up missions and locations, and introducing Service Records into the Warfighter Modern era.

    "Description": "Borodino&#10;7 September 1812 was the single bloodiest day of the Napoleonic Wars.&#10;&#10;The Russian forces which, since June, had retreated eastwards in front of Napoleon&rsquo;s advancing Grande Armee at last made their stand at the village of Borodino on the road to Moscow. Their newly appointed commander, Mikhail Kutuzov, had chosen his ground wisely. The marshy and wooded terrain around the village favoured the defender and Kutuzov strengthened his position still further by fortifying many of the natural obstacles. Here the Russians waited.&#10;&#10;Far from friendly territory, short of supplies, and with Winter approaching, Napoleon had little choice but to attack in order to open the way to the relative safety of Moscow. A series of frontal attacks by both sides resulted in an orgy of slaughter. The fighting involved around 250,000 troops and nearly 70,000 were left on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Both armies suffered terribly; but, it was the Russians who left the field and the way open for the Grande Armee to march on to Moscow. Too exhausted to follow their beaten foe, nearly week was to pass before the leading units entered the city. The victory proved to be pyrrhic. The Russian Tsar Alexander had no intention of suing for peace; but, instead waited for Winter to come to his aid. With supplies running out and the weather worsening, the Grande Armee evacuated the city in October. So began the famous retreat from Moscow.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Borodino is a tactical level two player game covering this bloodiest of battles. One player takes the role of Napoleon, commanding the Grande Armee, and the other of Kutusov leading the Russians. The battle is a source of great debate amongst historians, and players have the opportunity to try some of the options available to both commanders. For example, had Napoleon committed his Imperial Guard, the only significant unit on the battlefield that remained in reserve, or had he heeded the advice of Marshal Davout to try to out-flank the Russian position, might he have succeeded in destroying the Russian army and winning not only the battle, but the entire war?&#10;&#10;The First Battle of Polotsk&#10;&#10;This relatively little-known battle, which took place on 17 August 1812, was one of the most significant of Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion of Russia. Leading the majority of his Grande Armee ever eastwards, Napoleon had reached Smolensk. He had assigned Marshal Oudinot, commander of the II Corps, to protect his northern flank and to test the strength of the Russian forces defending the road to St Petersburg, the Russian capital. It transpired that these comprised only a single Corps, perhaps 25,000 men, commanded by General Wittgenstein. Impatient with Oudinot for failing to attack Wittgenstein, Napoleon dispatched St. Cyr's VI Corps to reinforce II Corps, bringing its strength up to about 32,000 men. The   aim was to defeat the Russians and, if possible, threaten St Petersburg.&#10;&#10;Faulty intelligence lead Oudinot to believe that Wittgenstein was too weak to mount an attack and so split his forces to making it easier for them to forage. He deployed II Corps on the southern bank and VI Corps on the northern bank of the River Dvna. Wittgenstein recognised that this left VI Corps, the weaker of the two, particularly vulnerable. The Russians attacked and heavy fighting ensued; but, the VI Corps fought bravely and held their position. Towards the end of the first day&rsquo;s fighting Marshal Oudinot was seriously wounded and command of both Corps passed to St. Cyr. The second day saw St. Cyr take the initiative. By feigning a retreat he was able to mislead Wittgenstein and suddenly launch a furious attack against the Russian centre and left flank. Just as defeat seemed inevitable, Wittgenstein ordered his cavalry to counterattack. They cut through the advancing enemy units only to be thrown back in confusion by French Cuirassiers.&#10;&#10;At this point, both sides were exhausted and had suffered heavy casualties. Each withdrew to a defensible position where they remained, watching each other, for the next two months until Napoleon&rsquo;s retreat from Moscow saw his northern flank again become the scene of desperate fighting.&#10;&#10;Although tactically it was a French victory, in strategic terms the First battle of Polotsk was a draw. Nonetheless, the strategic significance of the battle was immense. With his northern flank no longer threatened Napoleon was able to continue his advance upon Moscow. A grateful Emperor rewarded St-Cyr with a marshal&rsquo;s baton. The Russian Tsar Alexander was similarly grateful to Wittgenstein. The threat to St Petersburg had been nullified. He awarded Wittgenstein the Order of St George and conferred upon him the title of &quot;Saviour of St Petersburg&quot;.&#10;&#10;The First Battle of Polotsk is a tactical level two player game covering this strategically significant engagement. One player takes the role of Oudinot, commanding two Corps of the Grande Armee, and the other of Wittgenstein leading the Russians. There is a range of  options open to both players to see if they can achieve the decisive and strategically decisive  victory which eluded their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;SHS Games&#10;&#10;The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.  The SHS incorporates several unique features intended to replicate in a simple and intuitive way the options available to a commander (the wargamer) of a large army.  So whilst the commander has complete freedom to devise a plan, and a good deal when positioning units which have yet to encounter the enemy, once battle is joined the options become increasingly limited and unforeseen events can play a part in determining the outcome.  Nonetheless, even at a tactical level a commander's decisions are crucial in shaping events. The key to success is a sound plan with a margin for error which allows for ill-fortune, the shrewd deployment of units so as to be able to implement that plan, and the timely commitment of reserves.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kliszow&#10;The Battle of Kliszow is a tactical level two player game covering this important engagement during the Great Northern War. One player takes the role of King Charles XII leading his Swedish troops, and the other of Augustus the Strong commanding a Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian army. This is a classic example of a small well-trained and highly motivated army taking on a larger force in a strong defensive position. Victory will go to the player who is best able to exploit the advantages available to him.&#10;&#10;Earlier in War, the Swedes had repulsed attacks on their empire by the Danes, Russians and Poles and had now taken the offensive by invading the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After occupying Warsaw, Charles marched west with the aim of defeating Augustus decisively. On 19 July 1702 the two armies were camped only five miles apart. However, they were separated by a large wood and a swamp. The latter shielded Augustus&rsquo; camp to the north whilst his left flank was protected by the River Nida. Undeterred by this, and by the fact that his army of 12,000 was outnumbered, maybe by as much as two-to-one, by the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanians, Charles advanced through the woods abandoning most of his guns during the march.&#10;&#10;In an effort to secure a decisive victory, Charles&rsquo; strategy was envelope the enemy army. However, this plan was disrupted when the commander of the assault on the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian right flank was killed and the advance halted. The Poles then counter-attacked, but were beaten back by the Swedish infantry, as was an attack by the Saxons across the marsh which separated the centre of the two armies. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the Poles then abandoned Augustus leaving the field and exposing his right flank. Even though Augustus still had the larger army, it was now badly unbalanced and the Swedes immediately began to roll up his right flank. In the chaos that followed, Charles was able to capture most of the enemy&rsquo;s artillery and to turn these guns upon the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanians. However, fierce resistance by Saxon units in the centre and on the left flank allowed most Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian units to withdraw.&#10;&#10;It was certainly a victory, but not the decisive victory for which Charles had been hoping.&#10;&#10;Fraustadt&#10;&#10;This battle between a Swedish army commanded by General Rehnsk&ouml;ld and a Saxon-Polish-Russian force lead by General Schulenburg took place on 13 February 1706.  It has been described as the &ldquo;Swedish Cannae&rdquo; because the Swedish cavalry carried out a double envelopment, encircling the enemy and bringing about a decisive victory reminiscent of Hannibal&rsquo;s success nearly 2,000 years previously. For the loss of only 400 men, the Swedes inflicted 7,000 casualties upon the Saxon-Polish-Russians and captured a similar number.&#10;&#10;Prior to the battle, King Charles XII was contemplating recalling his over-stretched forces from Poland. Indeed, in the lead up to the battle Rehnskold deliberately gave the impression that the Swedes were withdrawing by retreating his 10,000 men towards Fraustadt. This ploy was successful in luring Schlenburg, at the head of 20,000 men, away from a very strong defensive position to pursue the Swedes. With the two armies now facing each other the Swedish cavalry launched repeated attacks on both flanks, eventually routing the enemy cavalry stationed on each.  They then wheeled to attack the rear of the Saxon-Polish-Russian infantry, with devastating results. At the same time the Swedish infantry began moving forward to assault Schulenburg&rsquo;s forces from the front, thereby completing the encirclement. Although the Saxon-Polish-Russian right flank held for a while, under this intense pressure the army soon broke and those who were unable to flee surrendered en mass.&#10;&#10;In terms of Sweden&rsquo;s campaign in Poland, the Battle of Fraustadt had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Rather than abandoning their campaign, the Swedes had become the dominant military power in the region. Before the year was over Saxony would sue for peace.&#10;&#10;Rehnskold had little option but to risk battle with Schlenburg&rsquo;s superior forces for fear that the odds would be tipped even further against him should Augustus the Strong, commanding 8,000 Saxons, join with Schlenburg. Augustus was only a few days&rsquo; march away from Fraustadt. In addition to the standard game, there is a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenario which envisages his arrival on 13 February 1706.   &#10;&#10;&#10;SHS Games&#10;&#10;The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.

    "Description": "In the year 2388, a group of university students working in the Tycho Crater settlement, New Pottsdam, invent the long-desired technology of a Faster Than Light (FTL) propulsion system.  (In this case, an Alcubierre design.)  Mankind expands outward in every direction, for 3000 light years, in the next 700 years.&#10;&#10;It is now the year 3000 AD, and after a little less than 700 years of FTL technology, man has created a modest sphere of inhabited systems some 6000 light years in diameter, and a collective population nearing 1 trillion souls.  Many, many systems containing habitable worlds still remain to be explored and colonized within that sphere, yet the expansion relentlessly continues.   A few, planet-bound sapient races have been found, but no other race with space travel (much less FTL capability) has yet to be revealed.&#10;&#10;But the Milky Way galaxy is a vast expanse of hundreds of billions of stars, and despite centuries of FTL drives, man has still only seen the smallest fraction of a single percentage point of those star systems.&#10;&#10;Much, much more lies out there, not the least of which is other, star-faring races.  And of those, some are hopefully friendly and open-armed (in some cases, figuratively), some likely paranoid beyond reason, some simply convinced that any species other than their own must be eradicated, but most will likely fall in various places across the spectrum of possibilities.  The diplomatic skills of man will be sorely tested, as may his ability and will to wage interstellar warfare.&#10;&#10;Fourth Millennium is a 4X game for 1 to 6 players, set on a map of the entire Milky Way galaxy &ndash; 100,000 light years in diameter &ndash; where each player will choose their own path in attempting to carve out the biggest and best empire, encountering a variety of 36, possible alien races, each with its own unique attributes, attitude, and aspirations, not to mention the empires being built by the other players.&#10;&#10;Staying relevant technologically will prove a challenge.  Some alien races you encounter may be more advanced than you&hellip;and not happy about your presence on their doorstep.  Indeed, you may even need to ally with other players in order to whittle down a common threat.&#10;&#10;And during your explorations, you may find multiple artifacts, left behind by a long-gone race.  They are key to understanding new technologies and improving your overall civilization.  But be forewarned. Those who left behind these artifacts - which we call &quot;The Andromedans&quot; - are still observing, may decide to intervene, and if so, with the sole intent of destroying all, competing star-faring races.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Sounds easy, right? Be warned, the mansion is guarded by a highly intelligent mad scientist, a highly indestructible robot, and a highly insecure sentient alien tentacle all of which can also be moved up and down floors to capture any intruders they encounter! If the players are caught, they are escorted from the mansion and any loot they had collected is lost (scored loot can never be lost). The mansion is full of secret passages that the players can use to avoid the guards and move more quickly up and down floors. Can you avoid capture, snag the loot, and escape the mansion to become the first player to score 30 points?&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
