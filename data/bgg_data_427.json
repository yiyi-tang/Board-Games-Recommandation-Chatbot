He&rsquo;s quite aware that he&rsquo;s the poorest, lowliest wretch in this god-forsaken village&mdash;and has the ripe, brown stains on his tattered shirt to prove it.

Nonetheless, a word festers in the back of Gong&rsquo;s mind: revolt!&#10;&#10;You and your friends will have a blast recreating medieval life by playing this fast pace, strategic and addicting card game where nothing is as it seems, nor as it should be.

    "Description": "Merchant Prince is a fairly simple Monpoly-inspired game - players purchase control of commodities and areas of the world and charge other players for landing on them, with the aim of bankrupting them.&#10;&#10;The basic game system is fairly novel.  There is a map of the world on which players move ships from port to port (along a track), and a standard track running around the outside of the board on which players move ambassador pieces.  On a turn a player rolls the die twice and must use one roll for each piece.  Control of commodities is purchased on outer track spaces, but your ship has to be at an appropriate port to do so, establishing a relation between the pieces.  Other spaces on the outer track reward or punish players controlling various commodities, and there are also spaces which allow one to become a Merchant Prince controlling one of the six regions of the world (and charge additional &quot;rent&quot; to players).&#10;&#10;Another interesting bit is that the game is nominally set in the 25th century, which is used to justify dividing the world into six regions rather than the nations of 1937.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is played on a 20x20 grid superimposed on a map. The map&rsquo;s terrain consists of various lakes, flatlands, caverns and mountains. Each player controls an army that consists of a variety of modern units depending on the scenario. Players set up their units any way they choose in their designed corner of the gameboard. A player may take four actions each turn but no piece may take more than two actions during a turn. Move, fire, rapid transit (move a piece in one&rsquo;s own corner without using the dice), place a jet or pass are the possible actions. Units within range of each other undertake combat by rolling the appropriate six-sided or eight-sided die. The victory conditions are dependent upon the scenario.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Imperial Rome and The Barbarians is the second expansion to Commands & Colors: Ancients. In this second expansion you will find historical battles that focus on Rome and the early Gallic invasion, invasion of the Northmen, the Servile War (Spartacus), Caesar's conquest of Gaul, the Roman Civil Wars and much more.&#10;&#10;Showcased in the second expansion, are over 20 scenarios that range from 390 BC (Allia River) to 9 AD (Teutoburger Wald), and all the blocks and labels you need to field the Roman and Barbarian forces to fight out these battles. By now, you know we can do this, because Commands & Colors: Ancients by design is a unique historical game system that allows players to effectively portray stylized Ancient battles that play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&#10;&#10;Imperial Rome and The Barbarians will feature at least one new unit type as well as several &quot;specialty&quot; units and leaders (Briton Chariots, Legionaries using the pilum, and Caesar, for example). Each of these operates within the confines of the original system rules, with only slight modifications to reflect their historical abilities and importance. So, rules-wise, if you've played Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble at all learning the few special rules for these new types of units.&#10;&#10;The battle dice resolve combat quickly and the Command cards provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities for victory. Yet the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Ancient units, their weapons, terrain and the history.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players must lay a path of  eras (cards) in chronological order, outwards from their edge of the board. The objective is to be first to  advance your playing piece onto the end era of your own path. Cards are drawn from a main pack which contains eras  cards . Play actions are determined by what symbol shows when the die is thrown. The three symbols are era ( reveal an era) , thunderbolt ( take a thunderbolt card) and eruption ( move or or erupt volcanoes on an opponents path). Thunderbolt cards are not laid but trigger various natural calamity and more benign events. Each era card is an aerial view associated with a particular evolutionary period. Each era card has various sites to be negotiated including rocks,waterholes, swamps, volcanoes, rising seas and ravines. Different sites have different levels of risk (hazardous areas). Certain thunderbolts can penalize players whose paths have cards that contain hazardous areas. Players interact by contesting some or each era card by a bidding using tokens.  A neat (new) rule limit player's from bidding excessively because tokens are lost by the winning bidder depending on the bid difference between his and the next highest bid.  A player who wins an era card may be include it in any path. He may for example, include a card with a risky site  in an opponent's path. Each player now has his own   cone (volcano) which  can be moved to  create an obstacle for an opponent's playing piece and can cause an eruption on an opponent path. An eruption   can be used to   force an opponents playing piece back .  The first player who survives his turn with his path complete ( 6 era cards ), holding at least one token  and with his  piece on his end ( sixth) era card  wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

There are four special places on the board, where players may improve or hamper their progress by completing a task. When a player lands on one of these spaces, however, all players get a chance at receiving the bonus or penalty: they complete to answer the math question posed by the roll of the dice. A player must complete all the tasks to get a home. Dice are used in the same way as in Blue Ribbon Pooch. The graphics on the game board depict various situations in which a child might interact with a dog.&#10;&#10;This is a children's game designed to develop math skills.&#10;&#10;",

During the course of the battle the Persian Prince Cyrus died which ended his revolt against his brother King Artaxerxes.  The famous retreat of the ten thousand Greek auxiliaries (which fought for Cyrus) was the result. The Greeks were led by the Athenian General Xenophon. This Greek army had to fight its way back to Greece through the hostile Persian Empire (from Mesopotamia and across Asia Minor). The Greek city of Sparta renewed the war against Persia in 399-394 BC.&#10;&#10;",

This random scenario system provides an almost unending variety of map configurations, force structures, and combat situations.

    "Description": "(from publisher's website)&#10;&#10;It's good to be the king.  When you rule the land by divine right, none may question your authority and you may do as you will.  You possess absolute power, giving your whim the force of law and drawing the people of the realm into your majestic presence as ants are drawn to sweet, pure honey.  Unfortunately, you are not the king.  You are one of the ants.&#10;&#10;The object of It&rsquo;s Good to Be the King is currying the most favor with the king by providing the most important elements for a series of events to honor him.  During the course of each game, the king demands that seven events be held for his pleasure.  These include such diversions as parades, hunts, feasts, and tourneys.&#10;&#10;In order to do the royal bidding, players manage their hands in order to collect the things necessary to satisfy the king&rsquo;s demands while preventing the other players from doing the same.  Use care when getting rid of your cards, since what is useless for the Tourney may be vital for an upcoming Feast!  The player who has the most royal favor at the end of the seventh round of play is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each set includes a Court Deck of 80 cards, a Chartulary Deck of 10 cards, and an instruction sheet.  It&rsquo;s Good to Be the King is suited for 3-6 players who do not mind backstabbing their opponents.  This fast and fun game of court intrigue and chicanery will be on store shelves this June, so round up some friends and prepare to be royally entertained!&#10;&#10;",

These are used to play two games, one (not given a separate title) which is rummy-like, and one, The Hunt for El Presidente, which is similar to Old Maid.&#10;&#10;For the first game, the cards can be combined with those from other TSR comics - Buck Rogers, 13: Assassin, RIP: Avenger of the Dead, Black Barney, and the Warhawks main feature.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game players compete to find magical artifacts from an ancient maze. The maze is enchanted and players can change its layout using only their minds. This way they can help themselves in their search or hinder their opponents. Coins placed number up on the maze represent either monsters (stronger the bigger the number on the coin) or artifacts (if the suit, revealed only to the player that lands there, matches the player's suit). First player to find 3 artifacts and exit the maze wins.&#10;&#10;This game was designed to be played with a piecepack set and a pentominoes set (e.g. Quintillions). The pentomino pieces are the walls for the maze. It gives a nice 3D feel to the game (each square section of the pentomino pieces has to be of the same approximate size as the small squares from the piecepack tiles). If you don't have a pentominos set, there's an alternative mechanic, although it changes the game a bit.&#10;&#10;",
