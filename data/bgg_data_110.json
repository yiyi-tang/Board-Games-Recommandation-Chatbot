    "Description": "Ulti is the national card game of Hungary.&#10;&#10;Background to the Game&#10;&#10;It was developed in the 20th century from the rules of the 18th century card game Marias and the 19th century card game Talonmarias. It is traditionally played with a special deck of cards called the William Tell deck. The deck has 32 cards - like a modern Skat deck - but uses German suits (Bells, Hearts, Leaves, Acorns).&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Ulti is a trick-taking game for three players. In each hand the player who wins the bidding chooses trumps (or no trumps) and plays alone against the other two players in partnership.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 10 cards. The start player is allowed to look at and swap with the two cards left over (called a Talon). Once they have done this they must make a bid. Each player in turn can choose to look at the Talon and swap cards with it but if they do they must make a bid which is of higher value than the previous one.&#10;&#10;Numerous different value bids can be made. These range from winning the hand, taking the last trick with the seven of the trump suit (Ulti), loosing every trick (Betli) or winning every trick (Durchmars). The value of most of these bids can be doubled by playing the Heart suit as the trump card. If a player thinks the winning bid will not be successful he can make a bid saying this when he plays the first trick (called a Kontra). At the end of the hand, if he is correct he will get double points (or money if playing for money.)&#10;&#10;Once the bid has been finalized the players play out the tricks. When the tricks have been finished the players see if the bid was successful. If the bid was successful the losing players give the winner the value of the bid (points or money). If the bid was unsuccessful the loser gives the other two players the value of the bid. If a player has called a Kontra he gets double points.&#10;&#10;Ulti has no fixed end point and players can play as many hands as they have time for.&#10;&#10;",

If you have an empty bed of the four in your hospital, draft a dino from the five available, then roll your dice.&#10;&#10;You start with three dice that show the three treatments needed to cure dinosaurs, a tranquilizer dart, and a wild icon. Spend treatment icons to heal your dinos; each one needs 1-5 treatments as depicted on their card. Any two matching icons can be used to acquire a single-use wild token or an upgrade card that provides a permanent beneficial effect; spend three matching icons to acquire more dice. If you have tranquilizers and bed space to spare, you can take more dino cards into your hospital. However, if a dinosaur isn't fully cured and has no sleep tokens on it, it wakes up and leaves the hospital &mdash; and if it's a carnivore, it takes another dinosaur with it when it goes!&#10;&#10;Cured dinosaurs move from the hospital to your victory pile, netting you the point value on the card. When one of the three card stacks is empty, complete the round, then see who's scored the most from their veterinary efforts.&#10;&#10;",

But wait &ndash; these aren't the knights of old, but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it's too late?&#10;&#10;In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game, the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high.&#10;&#10;In game terms, the quests are represented by five types of cards, with each card showing 1-3 swords, as well as a number from 2 to 5 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game, with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Reveals a rumor card.&#10;    Attempts a quest.&#10;    Accuses a knight.&#10;&#10;&#10;To reveal a rumor card, the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it's a quest card, players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest, with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed, players can no longer speak to one another; in addition, Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again.&#10;&#10;Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11, 12 or 13. Any lower, and they arrived too soon, wasting time; any higher, and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest, the player points to the top quest card and says, &quot;It's time.&quot; The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13, then the players receive 1-3 white swords, as shown on the quest cards. If lower, they receive one black sword; if higher, 1-3 black swords. All other quests are checked to see whether the players were too late, then the stack resets. A failed quest rewards the attempter with a special bonus card for later use.&#10;&#10;Once three swords have been claimed, whatever the color, a player can choose to accuse another player of being traitorous to the cause, winning a reward if correct and a penalty otherwise. If the players collect seven white swords, they have stopped Morgan's forces and win. If, however, they collect seven black swords first, then Arthur's kingdom falls.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;    Shadows over Camelot&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;A Pragmatic War: The War of the Austrian Successione 1741 - 1748&quot; is a two-player wargame simulating the War of the Austrian Succession. The war like its predecessor, the War of the Spanish Succession (excellently portrayed by Don Herndon&rsquo;s No Peace Without Spain!) was fought primarily to determine who would succeed to the throne of a great empire, in this case the Austrian Empire. When the current ruler of the Austrian crown lands and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Charles VI died without male issue he had laid the groundwork for his eldest daughter Maria Theresa to succeed to the Hapsburg crown lands.  Known as the &ldquo;Pragmatic Sanction&rdquo;, this diplomatic effort obtained the agreement of the leading powers of Europe to her accession to the Hapsburg dominions and the election of her paramour as the next Holy Roman Emperor. However, with the opportunistic seizure of Silesia by the young Frederick the Great of Prussia, the agreement unraveled and the war began.  In time, it would involve virtually all of Europe.&#10;&#10;One player represents the Austrian interest represented by the Austrians and those powers in Europe faithful to the original agreement, (&ldquo;the Pragmatic Alliance&rdquo;). The other player represents the challengers to the Austrians, the Bavarian rival for the Imperial title, Charles Albert and his supporters, primarily the Bourbon rulers of France and Spain intermittently joined by Prussia (&ldquo;the Bourbons&rdquo;). Each &ldquo;faction/alliance&rdquo; consists of a number of allied powers representing the military forces of various states and royal houses of Europe.&#10;&#10;The simulation is based upon the &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; system, yet adapted to reflect the historical situation of 1741. Victory is determined by the faction that more closely obtains their goals - represented by victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Additionally, cards have Special Actions. Use these during a round to rearrange cards, cause more damage, recover cards, get bonuses and more.&#10;&#10;The player with active cards remaining at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

The games in the series had 120 counters and were supposed to be playable in 120 minutes or less, hence the name.&#10;&#10;The game plays quite fast because the rules, while badly referenced (typical of GDW), are quite straight forward (medium simple). You need to get some card and mount the boards, but the boards themselves are nice enough. The counters are standard fare, but have no printing on the back to show disrupted units.&#10;&#10;The system is based on that used in Imperium: Empires in Conflict &#226;&#128;&#147; Worlds in the Balance.&#10;&#10;",

We use six and ten sided dice, statlines and modifications to represent every aspect of the game, from scenery effects, shooting, ramming and sideswiping, to using equipment like Nitros, Oil Slicks and Smoke Screens.&#10;&#10;",

The time period is mid-19th century and you start your expedition at one of the six Ports of Entry.&#10;&#10;Your journey is financed by a major newspaper and publisher back home, and they expect you to bring home fantastic stories that they can publish. Your expedition consists of you and armed askaris, which are local African soldiers, and porters that carry food and gifts. There will be occasional local guides and goats to keep you company.&#10;&#10;The quest is to trek into what is unknown to you. You will interact with people that you meet, while searching for the myths and legends that are said to exist somewhere in Africa. To walk the land among people that might not appreciate your presence, to face hunger and predators, and to reveal what perhaps should remain hidden is dangerous. Not only are the lives of your expedition at stake, but your sanity as well.&#10;&#10;But then again, as the old trader said, &quot;are you not entering the Heart of Darkness?&quot;&#10;&#10;The map covers Central and Southern Africa and is divided along ethnic groups. Your expedition/marker moves from area to area searching for myths and legends. You only carry gifts and food and is therefore forced to interact with local people and to hunt. You will encounter wildlife, hostile people and various disasters which will wear down your health and sanity. Your object is to accumulate more Drama Points (for the publisher back home) than your competitors before any of the player's explorer dies or goes mad in the bush.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;The Price of Freedom: The American Civil War, 1861-65 is Renaud Verlaque&#039;s second published design after Age of Napoleon, winner of 2003 Best Pre-WW2 Historical Boardgame CSR award.&#10;&#10;The Price of Freedom is a true grand-strategic-level look at the American Civil War. Using an original card-driven system, it provides strong historical flavor in a simple game that can consistently be played in three hours. This makes The Price of Freedom an ideal game for today's gamer's busy lifestyle, as well as for tournaments.&#10;&#10;As you might expect from a quick-playing game, counter density in The Price of Freedom is purposefully low and is also constrained by each side&rsquo;s War Effort level, an aggregate measure of economic, political and diplomatic support for the war. Each military game piece represents a &quot;corps&quot; of 20-30,000 men. Corps must organized into armies led by the colorful commanders that every American Civil War aficionado has come to love or hate. Twenty-five historical army commanders are available for theater or field command, from Ben &quot;Spoons&quot; Butler to &quot;Massa&quot; Robert E. Lee, with each commander rated -1, 0 or +1 for offense, defense and movement.  Armies move and fight on a functional and yet very attractive point-to-point representation of the Eastern and Western theaters, vying to capture or defend critical territory or simply to beat each other out.&#10;&#10;The card-driven engine ensures that no game of The Price of Freedom is ever the same as another and that there are plenty of hard choices to make in each campaign impulse. The game uses a well-balanced deck of 55 cards that are all playable by both sides. Each card has two uses that are generally mutually exclusive: either it can be used by spending its operational value (ranging 1-3) on various actions (moving, reorganizing or reinforcing armies) or it can be used to implement the event described on the card. Events can affect army leadership (Commander-in-Chief, Clash of Egos, Shot from the Saddle) or battle resolution (Blundering Fool; Seeing the Elephant; Bickering Generals; etc.), help gain operational advantage (Strategic Transfer; Turning Movement; Interior Lines), or simulate major political, economic or diplomatic events (Draft; Kentucky; Blockade; etc.). Like overall army size, hand size is dictated by each side's War Effort level.&#10;&#10;The Union player can win by driving down the Confederate War Effort level low enough or by vastly outnumbering Confederate troops. The Confederate player can win in similar fashion or by hanging long and well enough to cause Lincoln to lose the 1864 elections or prevent the Union player from achieving the historical outcome.&#10;&#10;So convene your cabinet, call up your generals, muster your troops, it is time to fight and find out what is the true Price of Freedom!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Compass Games website:)Components:&#10;    1 25&quot;x19&quot; cardstock map&#10;    132 counters&#10;    1 deck of 55 playing cards&#10;    2 player-aid cards&#10;    1 rules booklet&#10;    2 6-sided dice&#10;    1 full color box and lid&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The eternal struggle between vampires and werewolves is coming to an end. The last Vampire Master and his Apprentice, Strigoi from Wallachia, are dwelling in the ancient fortress of Tismana: a stronghold haunted by evil undead creatures. Nevertheless, the POWERWOLF  &mdash; sons of the Legends of the Night and the Armenia Savage Army &mdash; the defenders of the &quot;Real Truth&quot;, prepare for a last frantic assault knowing there are no alternatives to victory!&#10;&#10;Armata Strigoi is a game in which the Powerwolf win or lose as a team, but each player makes their own decisions about their actions and movements. Each player represents one of the Powerwolf heroes which assault the Strigoi&rsquo;s fortress as a single pack. In order to win they have to defeat both Vampires. However, the two foes are initially invulnerable and their vitality is intrinsically linked to their dwelling fortress, thus, upon the demise of the first vampire the whole structure will start to crumble and collapse on itself, making the victory a race against time!&#10;&#10;The Powerwolf act collectively, but a pack of werewolves during a furious assault is not known to be a highly organized band that can devise and set up high-profile strategies and tactics. Hence, the players are forbidden from sharing details about their cards, though they can talk to each other, propose joint actions, or heal a comrade.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by defeating both Strigoi. To make them vulnerable, the Powerwolf must first collect Blood Points by decimating the fellow Creatures of the Night who haunt the fortress. During their quest, they can also collect weapons and magical artifacts.&#10;&#10;If one Strigoi perishes, the other immediately turns into a Supreme Master Vampire, making them even more lethal. At the same time, the fortress starts to crumble and collapse room by room. If both Strigoi are defeated, the Powerwolf pack wins the game. It is not an easy task, but let the hunt begin!&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Artwork credits:&#10;Original Illustrations by Zsofia Dankova&#10;Boardgame artwork by Paolo Vallerga&#10;Miniatures sculpted by Alan D&rsquo;Amico - OrcoNero&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On Sunday, 7 December 1941, the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, was attacked by Japanese aircraft. For the next four years, Allied task forces engaged elements of the Imperial Japanese fleet throughout the ocean. Marines and army units began their program of island-hopping, wresting from the Japanese the empire that they had expanded in every direction.&#10;&#10;War in the Pacific is a multi-level simulation of the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. The game enables players to recreate the entire course of the war with the US, from the opening Japanese attack on 7 December, 1941 to the climatic Allied assaults in the closing days of 1945. Representing some 30% of the globe, the strategic maps let players move and engage in combat on all levels: air, ground and naval. War in the Pacific is not a simple game; there are a number of rules and concepts that will, at first, be unfamiliar to a majority of players. But playing through smaller map sections and scenarios enables the player to become familiar with the mechanics of the game.&#10;&#10;This is a reprint edition which substantially expanded the original's components.  Components: 7 full size (22 x 34&quot;) strategic maps in full color, new tactical maps with nearly 338 individual islands for new ground units to fight over, 32 die-cut counter sheets, nearly 9,000 counters showing all types of units from the Pacific Theater, rule books, chart books and assorted displays and player aid charts.&#10;&#10;The rules have undergone significant change with greatly increased emphasis on detail  in combat while removing the detailed logistics system that was the focus of the old game and replacing it with a command point system modeled after Victory Games' &quot;Pacific War.&quot;&#10;&#10;The order of battle is significantly more detailed. Leaders on many levels (and whose combat performance may be unpredictable), often serve to limit players' ability to affect the outcome of every battle to the Nth degree. A player's assignment of the right task force commander (for the right force at the right time), may spell the difference between a tactical victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;The ground combat system has been completely revised, substituting a step-loss system adapted from VG's &quot;Pacific War.&quot; Pitched battles on islands and atolls are now resolved, including maneuver, on expanded tactical maps in six different scales, rather than simply being abstractly represented in a single hex on the strategic maps.&#10;&#10;War in the Pacific's original air and naval systems are retained, in their essence, albeit with substantial modifications and above all added chrome in combat. Thus the game still feels like the original in those two aspects.&#10;&#10;The game comes with the grand campaign and some small introductory battle scenarios.&#10;&#10;Booklets:&#10;&#10;    Rulebook I (rule 1.0 to 25.0)&#10;    Rulebook II (rule 26.0 to 62.0)&#10;    Scenarios &amp; Campaign reinforcements&#10;    Examples of Play, Optional Rules &amp; Designer's Notes&#10;    Chartbook I&#10;    Chartbook II&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If you can add it to your collection, do so; if not, return the bird to the grid with the newly revealed side face up. Your goal is to collect sets of birds in a single color, with you needing to take the single bird first, then the pair, then the triplet. The first player to collect 2-4 sets wins, with the number being dependent on the number of players. Watch what others do, remember what was flipped where, and play the odds when deciding to flip the birds!&#10;&#10;",

Show your skills better than your rivals, and you&rsquo;ll ride the perfect wave to victory!&#10;&#10;The Perfect Wave presents a very fun and unique challenge. You&rsquo;ll need to successfully create a wave by drafting Wave cards to construct a sequence, earning points for runs and sets of numbers. Play Trick cards to show off and score bonuses. But you&rsquo;ll also need to simultaneously focus on paddling far enough out in the water to actually catch, surf, and score the very wave you're creating!&#10;&#10;And here&rsquo;s the twist...the more time spent creating your wave, the less you&rsquo;ll be able to paddle out...and the more you paddle out, the trickier it becomes to create your wave! You&rsquo;ll need careful planning and expert timing to balance these goals and win the game!&#10;&#10;The Perfect Wave was the winner of the 2021 Cardboard Edison Award.&#10;&#10;",

During a player's turn, they can choose one of these three options:&#10;&#10;Place a koinobori card on the festival masts: Play a koinobori card on one of the masts. At the end of the game and on each mast, only the color of the koinobori with the most presence on that mast will score points.&#10;&#10;Place a koinobori card on their personal mast: Play koinobori cards face down on your mast.

With a unique deck of captain cards, individual strengths, and special abilities, each captain offers players a very different game experience.&#10;&#10;Players seek to explore and control locations in the galaxy to gain the resources, artifacts, and technology to help them face more difficult encounters later in the game. As players explore the galaxy, and time passes, encounters become more rewarding, but the penalty for failure rises. Players determine the length of the game by how quickly they move through the galaxy, and how well they manage the damage inflicted on them by their travels, or by their fellow captains.&#10;&#10;The galaxy offers a variety of encounters where players can control individual locations through the use of six different skills, such as science, diplomacy, or tactics, depending on an individual&rsquo;s play style and captain&rsquo;s strengths. Players can also brave open space, random encounters which increase in difficulty as the game progresses, or explore discoveries and uncover many different stories in the game. How well a player does at exploring and controlling the galaxy is reflected in their victory points.&#10;&#10;Made up of modular tiles, the galaxy itself, and many of the elements within, is very different each and every time you play Emergence Event, allowing for great replayability and unique challenges with every game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Valley of Tears is a Battalion Combat Series wargame depicting the entire 1973 Yom Kippur war from 6 October 1973 until the ceasefire enforced by the Superpowers and the UN. As the culmination of over 20 years of research in consultation with world-class experts, Valley of Tears shows the Yom Kippur war at a level of detail not yet seen. For the first time ever, for example, the game&rsquo;s maps were precisely drawn using actual tactical Israeli maps used during the war and include the official code names for hilly defensive positions in both battle areas.&#10;&#10;Valley of Tears takes the BCS into a whole new level: that of post WW2 operations. For example, its dedicated air warfare system allows BCS players to not only pit F-4 Phantoms against MiG-21 Fishbeds in the contest for air superiority, but also assign the Front&rsquo;s air units to execute SEAD and Deep Strike (both RAM and DOMINQUE) missions (to suppress the ever present SAM threat and attack enemy air bases/destroy enemy infrastructure, respectively) as well as the traditional (but more effective) BCS Close Air Support missions.&#10;&#10;The game presents the largest tank battle since WWII, with the Cold War adversaries fighting a proxy war where the latest Centurion and Patton tanks faced off against T-62s following Soviet tactical doctrines.&#10;&#10;Expecting to have to repeat the war&rsquo;s of 1967 and 1956, the Israelis were confronted by the then-new and unexpected masses of Sagger missiles and RPG hand-held weapons. It&rsquo;s your job to win the war, with or against, these new weapons and the much more effective and versatile air war to generate a win without taking excessive casualties making the win Pyrrhic.&#10;&#10;Can you master the deadly environment and become the victor?&#10;&#10;Winner of the 2023 Charles S. Roberts Awards for Best Modern Game.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;The Yom Kippur War: Two Front Campaign (All 4 maps)&#10;On the Banks of the Suez: The Sinai Front Campaign (3 maps)&#10;Syrians at the Border: Golan Front Campaign (1 map)&#10;Dual for the Golan (1 map)&#10;Iraqi Intervention (1 map)&#10;Aryeh Dov (1 map)&#10;Operation Stouthearted Men (less than 1 map)&#10;Africa (2 maps)&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;BCS rulebook (v2.0, in full color)&#10;Two BCS Charts and Tables (v2.0, in full color)&#10;BCS Support rulebook (v2.0, in full color)&#10;VoT Game Specific rulebook&#10;Israeli Player Booklet&#10;Arab Player Booklet&#10;Turn Record Track Card&#10;Israeli Player Display Card&#10;Arab Player Display Card&#10;Two Frontal Air Display Cards&#10;Four 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps (Three Sinai, One Golan)&#10;1,400 Counters (Three unit sheets and Two BCS marker sheets)&#10;8 scenarios total, 4 one-map (or smaller) scenarios of 2 to 5 turns.&#10;Box and Dice&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Fun for both adults and kids, Barnyard Roundup is a game that doesn&rsquo;t feel like a &ldquo;task&rdquo; to play for the adults and is on a level a kid would enjoy.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect the most valuable farm animals for Farmer Brown to sell on Market Day. You do this by playing cards face-down from your hand and declaring what they are, then giving one other player the choice to decide if you are bluffing or telling the truth. If they choose correctly, THEY get the Farm Animal card(s) you played, but if they guess wrong, YOU get the card instead. Whoever wins Farm Animal cards adds them to their collection. But you may also get Crows, pests that irritate Farmer Brown and count against you in the scoring.&#10;&#10;Collect the most animals by bluffing, baffling and out-guessing your friends! Score the most points and win the game!&#10;&#10;Barnyard Roundup is a family-friendly, appropriate game for ages 7 and up. We have played the game with players as young as 4 and had a lot of fun! Everyone in the family will enjoy this game, we have even brought this out on game night with the adults and had a great time!&#10;&#10;",

A herd of 10 working elephants is hard to keep in check. Their job is to collect tree trunks, and the need to be carefully moved over the working area to accomplish this. To keep rival elephants from snatching trunks out from under their trunk or sending elephants off on the wrong path, two elephants have a special designation: Black Elephants, which have the ability to block spaces and can also capture rival elephants.&#10;&#10;[Text from a preview by Spielbox]&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Roman Empire exists for almost 400 years. It is, however, but a pale shadow of what it used to be in the times of Caesar or Trajan. The World is changing and new powers are rising; soon they will begin to harass and attack the Roman lands. Deep within the impenetrable and dark forests, which stretch beyond the rivers of Rhine and Danube, live brave Germans, who turn their greedy eyes on rich towns and villages spread across the Roman provinces. It would be, however, a lot easier to pillage and conquer if not for rivalry and constant wars between tribes and warbands.&#10;&#10;&quot;Germania Magna: Border in Flames&quot; is a card-wargame of shifting alliances. Each player assume the role of a Germanic warlord leading his warriors into Roman provinces, which lie across the Rhine and Danube rivers. The Roman Empire is still too strong to be conquered, but its fields and cities provide loot for your warriors, and its armies give you an excellent opportunity to prove yourself as a worthy leader and, by doing so, to achieve eternal glory for yourself. The enemy is very powerful, so to win you need to forge alliances (however fragile) with other warlords, who will switch sides each time the tide of war changes.&#10;&#10;",

Celebrated by many as one of the finest and often sought-after game titles ever produced by Game Designers&rsquo; Workshop (GDW, 1979) on a fascinating, almost forgotten conflict that would determine the course of European history for the next twenty years or more.&#10;&#10;To the West, the First World War was &ldquo;the war to end all wars&rdquo;. To the submerged nationalities of Eastern Europe, this war removed the obstacles to their political aspirations&ndash; Tsarist Russia collapsed in 1917; Germany and Austria-Hungary were defeated in 1918. The disintegration of these empires sparked a chaotic period of struggles in Eastern Europe, as proponents of the old order, nationalists, and revolutionary socialists fought for supremacy. The conflict between the Poles and the Bolsheviks was the most important campaign in determining the borders of Eastern Europe.&#10;&#10;Red Star/White Eagle is an operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the 1920 conflict over the border areas of Eastern Europe. Game play is not for the faint of heart with open maneuvering creating a fast and fluid situation as both sides seek the opportunity to outflank and attack. Nearly any defensive line can be bypassed in the wide-open expanse of West Russia, forcing players to probe for vulnerabilities and seize the initiative. An exhaustive Order of Battle helps capture the key historically facets of the campaign including supply, cavalry charges, armored trains, loss of command, inter-front cooperation, rail nets, railroad reserve, flotillas and marines, border garrisons, numerous specialized units, and more.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature Edition provides a fully updated treatment to the GDW 1979 release that honors the original game design. All aspects of the game are being enhanced, based on years of player experience and feedback. One example is adding initial set-up and reinforcement entry codes to all units to ease set-up and play. Play time can vary with three scenarios provided and the Campaign Game. While suitable for solitaire play and designed as a two-player game, the Campaign game is credited as allowing for up to three players (with two playing the Russian side). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in paying homage and celebrating the original classic design by David Williams. All components are upgraded to include a larger playing surface () and to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    two maps&#10;    two countersheets (344 5/8&rdquo; counters)&#10;    five player aid cards &#10;    one small deployment map&#10;    one rule book (28 pages)&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the publisher and back of the box)&#10;&#10;",

The game includes 80 color cards and 30 point cards (valued -4 to 10); each color card has 1-4 words on it, with the words being one of five colors but printed in one of the remaining four colors. Thus, the card might have &quot;Gelb&quot; (yellow) printed twice, but in black ink.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the color cards, then spread them out on the table. Reveal as many points cards as the number of players. Each player takes a starting card and places it at the beginning of a row. Simultaneously, players start flipping over cards to find one that fits next to their rightmost card, with &quot;fits&quot; meaning that neither of the two colors on the rightmost card are repeated on the new card and the number of words showing on the two cards differ. If you draw a card that meets this description, add it to your row and draw again; if not, place it face-up on the table.&#10;&#10;Once a player has a certain number of cards in their row &mdash; 7 to 11 depending on the number of players &mdash; they call &quot;Stop!&quot; All players check their card rows for errors, discarding any mistaken card and all cards played after it. The player with the longest row of cards claims the highest point card on display; the player with the second-longest row the next highest point card; and so on.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the color cards for a new round of play. After five rounds, the player with the highest point total wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Glory II: Across the Rappahannock (AtR) is the second game in GMT's acclaimed American Civil War series, Glory. Glory presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play with solid historical insight. Across the Rappahannock revises the original design to make all of those features even better. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.&#10;&#10;Across the Rappahannock still features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Best of all, these new mechanics are not only retro-fitted to the original Glory, but Glory II: AtR provides all the counters necessary to play the battles in the original Glory game (Manassas and Chickamauga) with the new rules!&#10;&#10;Across the Rappahannock brings you two of the biggest battles in the Civil War; battles that have received scant attention from the hobby: Fredericksburg, with Burnside's frontal assault across the river against a heavily defended Confederate position, and Chancellorsville, the biggest battle in the entire war. And, while the full game of the latter battle uses 3 maps and a lot of your time, there are two standard one-map battles and three smaller scenarios highlighting engagements within the bigger battles that use few counters and take only a couple of hours to play!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;A party game for horrible people.&quot;&#10;&#10;Play begins with a judge, known as the &quot;Card Czar&quot;, choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.&#10;&#10;From the website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

The Campaign Game opens with the French exiting the mountains of Franconia and Thuringia in a drive on Leipzig, hoping to knock the Saxons out of the opposing alliance. Their cavalry probes ahead. They have no idea where the Prussians are, or their Russian allies. At the same moment Brunswick directs three Prussian armies to drive across the supposed French line of communications. As flank guards skirmish, the veil is lifted. Both sides find their armies abreast one another heading in the opposite directions! It is a race to see which army can adapt to the new circumstance quickest. Napoleon has the edge, and it is what separates warfare of the 18th and 19th centuries from one another ... La Batallion Carre!&#10;&#10;With Jena, like its predecessor L'Arme&#195;&#169; du Nord: the Belgian Campaign 1815, players can come to full grip with the game in less than 12 pages of rules.

    "Description": "The Pyramid of Keops (also known as Giza) was the first wonder of the Ancient World. Built around 2600 BC, it was the tallest building on Earth for nearly 4,000 years. For its construction were used about 2 million blocks of granite stone, covered by limestone, assembled by complex systems of wooden cranes and transported on barges from the Upper Nile. Various theories suggest that the Egyptians had access to advanced technology, or even that they were assisted by otherworldly beings.&#10;&#10;Be that as it may, the construction of The Pyramids was the most important engineering work of mankind to date, with an unprecedented waste of resources and manpower.&#10;&#10;In Keops, you will become one of the Viziers of Pharaoh Khufu, who has decreed the construction of the largest pyramid to date. The eternal glory of all Mizraim is at stake. You will have to compete with the rest of the Viziers to obtain the Pharaoh's favor and make Mizraim the envy of the people who want to destroy it. Keep Ra and the other gods of the Pantheon happy, making offerings in their temples.&#10;&#10;Construct buildings to obtain better rents when you recover your officials, besides obtaining prestige constructing a city worthy of the Pharaoh's relatives and assistants. Reinforce the borders with your Medjay to avoid the invasion of the fearsome enemies of Egypt.  Acquire the best barges in the port, fill your warehouses with granite and limestone, and send your craftsmen to prepare the tomb for Jufu's journey to the afterlife, building the first Wonder of the ancient world. The game is played over three rounds, marked by the construction of the three levels of the Pyramid. During the round, players will take turns until the current level of the Pyramid is built. To do so, they will have to wisely manage their craftsmen, scribes and priests, without forgetting their needs and happiness.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, the Pharaoh Jufu will grant his Favor to the Viziers (players) who have contributed the most to the defense of the Frontiers, the welfare of the Gods, the construction of the city and the Pyramid. Keops is an action building game, with worker placement and resource management mechanics. The actions available at the start of the game are related to obtaining materials to build the Pyramid and defending the borders. However, as players build the city, and new temples and crops, the available actions will increase, increasing the possibilities and strategies. Each game of Keops is conditioned to what the players build, so each one will be a different experience. This, added to the different families available and the use of the Decree cards, which modify the rules of the game, make each game completely different. This is one of the strong points of Keops.&#10;&#10;The game is played over three rounds, the end of each round being determined by the level of construction of the pyramid. During a round, players will play their turns one at a time, assigning their officials to the various actions or removing them from the central board to obtain their rents and pay their salaries. Each of the buildings that have been constructed are available to all players, regardless of who built them. However, you will receive benefits every time another player makes use of one of your buildings. This is important when it comes to developing your long-term strategy, as it provides extra income, which always comes in handy. In Keops there are no victory points. To win the game you will have to win the favor of the Pharaoh Jufu. Be the player with more offerings in the temple of Ra, to obtain the favor of the priests of the Pharaoh. Build the Pyramid to earn the favor of the architects' guild of Jufu. Defend the Borders hiring Medjays to avoid the invasion of your territories and not to lose resources, workers or your own buildings. And build the city to obtain Prestige, thus gaining the Favor of the Pharaoh's court. At the end of each level of the Pyramid, players will have the opportunity to obtain these favors, but also to lose them...&#10;&#10;For the most daring, the Ra-utoma deck adds a virtual player with three levels of difficulty in games for 1 to 3 players, who will make things difficult for the Viziers. All this under the watchful eye of Jufu, who will not stop in the construction of his great tomb. Although players do not build the Pyramid, the game itself will do it little by little, so every action becomes relevant, because you never know how much time you have left to obtain the Pharaoh's favor.&#10;&#10;",

It is &quot;A faithful reproduction of the original product released in 1991. Guaranteed to have you jump, laugh and scream just like they did in the 90s!&quot;  This special 30th Anniversary Kickstarter edition of Nightmare/Atmosfear not only pays homage to the origins of this unique video-meets-boardgame experience, it also expands on the original with deluxe game play extras and new custom pieces made especially for this campaign.&#10;&#10;We are not only re-creating the original game from 30 years ago, we are also refining and improving the original with new playing pieces, extra cards, and incorporating the crazy Baron Samedi expansion. In addition we have commissioned an entirely new and original backstory of The Gatekeeper and his mission on and under the earth called &quot;The Lore of the Other Side&quot; - this will be penned as a graphic novel.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You're the chieftain of your clan and are in charge of making your clan safe from Monsters, while keeping a competitive advantage against other clans. Some of the inhabitants are in hiding, and you need to figure out which inhabitant is where, and chase any Monster to the Open Highlands or rivalling clans.&#10;&#10;This game is all about memorising cards, taking calculated risks, and strategic long-term decision-making.&#10;&#10;It's super easy to learn (5 minutes), fun for the whole family (2-6 players), and can be replayed over and over again.&#10;&#10;HOW IT WORKS&#10;&#10;Start of the game&#10;Every chieftain starts with four cards faced down in front of them. This is your clan, and each card is one of its inhabitants. To start, each player may peek once at the bottom two cards. Remember them well.&#10;&#10;Objective&#10;The goal is to get rid of the Monsters in your clan by chasing them to your opponents or the open Highlands. Each card has a set amount of points, the scarier the monster, the more points it has. So the aim is to have the fewest amount of points. Once you think you're in that position and no longer have any Monster cards in your clan, you can call 'Saorsa' (&quot;freedom&quot; in Gaelic) and after one final turn by each player, the round will end.&#10;&#10;During a turn&#10;Option A) You take the top card from the discard pile (Open Highland pile) and swap it with one of your clan cards - any actions displayed on the card cannot be taken.&#10;&#10;Option B) You take the top card from the closed pile and choose:&#10;1. Place it directly on the Open Highland pile and perform the action as described on the card.&#10;2. Swap it with one of your clan cards - any actions displayed on the card cannot be taken.&#10;&#10;Whenever a card is discarded on the Open Highland pile, any player that knows the position of that same card in any of the clans may quickly grab that card and place it on top of the discarded card. This is how you get fewer inhabitants in your clan.&#10;&#10;There are a number of special cards in the game, there is a Witch who allows you to peek at one card each turn or the Evil Priest of Forvie, who will no longer be evil once he is converted by the Missionary. So taking big calculated risks can have big rewards, just like in real life.&#10;&#10;End of the round&#10;If you don't have any monsters in your clan, just before it's your turn, you can declare 'Saorsa'. Every other player will take one last turn and the round ends and points will be counted. If the player that called Saorsa has the lowest amount of points, she or he will win a Victory Token.&#10;&#10;Some cards in your clan might not seem too good at first sight, containing too many points, but keeping them in your clan will give you great advantages in future rounds.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all four Victory Tokens have been won.&#10;&#10;-description by designer&#10;&#10;",

LNA uses cards to represent the military units, supply convoys and objectives of the historic campaign. To win, you must consider your units' combat power and maneuver options as well as their supply situation. The game features: the Afrika Korps, Tobruk, the Desert Rats, Malta, anti-tank guns, resupply from Europe, minefields and more. LNA is based around a new combat system that makes maneuver and planning as important as brute force. That approach is faithful to the historic events, in which smaller forces were often able to defeat and rout larger ones by using better tactics and planning. In LNA, battles can be won not only by overwhelming the enemy with firepower, but also by out-thinking and bluffing him. The dynamic game system puts you in charge of one of the most famous theaters of WWII.&#10;&#10;Lightning Game Series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This wargame details the worldwide European explorations and colonizations of the 15th and 16th centuries.&#10;The map is directly based on a &quot;wrong&quot; historical map. Event cards seem to cover just about every dimension of the period. The underlying game system also offers opportunity for strategy and negotiation as well as chaos. The seagoing players, Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Dutch, each have national differences and advantages/disadvantages.  This is also true for Russia and Turkey which can colonize overland. There is also provision for general European war.  Multiple scenarios are provided. Also included are rules for 1 or 2 players which permit Spain and Portugal to participate as non-players.&#10;&#10;One interesting dimension of the game is the idea that each player also has a &quot;job&quot; within the game, from which he occasionally earns a little income.  One of them was even The Rules Lawyer, in charge of resolving any disputes!&#10;&#10;In 1992, expanded to support 8 players, including China, with the Columbus expansion kit commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus' initial voyage.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Take It or Leave It is a game title asking to be mocked by those who don't like the design, so here's hoping it goes over well with audiences.&#10;&#10;What is the game, you ask? Each player has a hand of four task cards showing dice combinations and other tasks that the player is trying to achieve during a game round, such as a sum of pips less than 13, or two white dice and one black die; each card has a point value on it, with the tougher cards obviously being worth more points. Someone rolls a bunch of white, black and red dice, then players take turns choosing a die from the pool. Each player also holds one action card that lets them manipulate the dice to better achieve their tasks.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either takes a die or passes from the round. Once everyone has passed, players assign dice to their task cards, with red dice counting as either black or white. Complete your tasks, and you'll cheer (and score points); have dice unused, and you'll wish that you'd never been born &ndash; or you'll just lose a couple of points. Depends on how much of a drama queen you are.&#10;&#10;After each round, a player refills his hand of cards in the appropriate proportions, and after each player has started a round 1-3 times (depending on the number of players), the game ends and players tally their points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is a simulation of real-world events. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position such as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took part in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strength of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. This gives Players a chance to &quot;change history.&quot; No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",

This streamlined approach means games are faster, with less rule-lawyering, providing a dynamic feel with combat that ebbs and flows. It also means that a game of MERCS is flexible; it can be played just about anywhere with any number of people.

Strange signs have started to appear all over the world: seas flecked with blood, flocks of shadowy figures wheeling in the sky, prophetic visions that leave people mumbling in addled madness. The time has finally come. The Old Ones are stirring, and it&rsquo;s your job to wake them up!&#10;&#10;In Rise of Cthulhu you play as the leader of a cultist faction wishing to awaken Cthulhu and the other Old Ones awaken to rule this world. But a competing faction races against you to be the first to awaken these chaotic masters. By playing various numbered and colored Cultist Cards, you must control the prime Lovecraftian locations &ndash; Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport &ndash; in an effort to awaken an Old One. The faction that maintains the most influence on a location will gain favor when the Old One arises, while the losing faction risks the destruction of their sanity and souls. Through clever pairing of colored and numbered cards, players can summon dangerous Monster Cards to their aid, unlock the eldritch secrets of lost Artifact Cards, and even manipulate an Unspeakable Guardian to terrorize your opponent. All of this and more await the cunning and adventurous in this tactical card game of influence and horror for 2 players.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will have 2 actions: you can either draw 2 cards, play 2 cards from your hand, or draw a card and play a card. Cards can be drawn from a face down deck of Cultist cards or a face up pile of discarded Cultists cards, known as the Valley. Cards must be played on your side of one of the four main Lovecraftian locations - Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport. The player with the most total points on a given location turns the location to face them, marking that location as being influenced by their cultists. As the values change during gameplay, locations will shift their influence from player to player. Playing three of the same color, three of the same number, or a run of three cards of the same color (ex. 2-3-4 of green) will earn players the right to draw from special Monster and Artifact cards to help their hold on locations or hinder their opponent. At key points in the game, Old Ones will be drawn from the Cultist Deck and attach themselves to a location: the player currently influencing that location will reap the benefits of the Old One. When all three Old Ones awaken, the game ends and the person with the most locations facing them (or points in play if there's a tie) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
