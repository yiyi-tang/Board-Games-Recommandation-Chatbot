    "Description": "Lord John issued the order and his men-at-arms stepped forward, shields raised and swords drawn.  Each man standing with his lord watched as the orcs gathered into an unruly mob, threats and swords rose in fury. With a howl, the orc warlord Grom ordered his warriors to battle, the mob surging forward, each orc slobbering for the blood of the humans before them, each trying to be the first to draw blood and reap death among their foes. Lord John ordered his men-at-arms to hold their line, for each man to gather his courage.  As the mob of green orcs reached the armored line of men, the sounds of battle &#10;and the screams of the dying could be heard across the field. &#10; This is Steel and Glory, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions.  A fast paced skirmish game of battle, skill and guts, Steel and Glory allows players to field small bands of warriors, who will then fight bloody engagements.  Each set within the system will cover two different forces, and also offer new battle tiles, new abilities and new excitement.  So don&rsquo;t wait, gather your warriors to you and fight for the glory of your chosen lord.&#10;&#10;",

The game itself plays like a simplified version of Advanced Wars for the Nintendo DS, but with a territorial control aspect that feels like Risk. Using a hex grid for our maps, we created a set of module pieces so that players set up the board before hand, creating a unique game every time it is played. The game comes with 32 separate board pieces for the players to place, though to use all in a single game is not suggested unless the players have a long time to play. Clockwork Crusade is made for 2-6 players and with the modular pieces the board can be made as small or as large as it is needed for the amount of players. Players will manage resources, create units and use strategy to outwit or outsmart their opponents and obtain victory!&#10;&#10;",

Its goal is to recreate the insane action stunts of movies like The Road Warrior and Death Race: 2000 using 1/64 scale toy cars (Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars, most commonly). Each car will be fully and easily customizable without complicated charts or difficult calculations. &#10;Each player controls one car, and that car has a point value based on its attributes. At the same time, there are cards that depict various optional equipment you can install on your car. The equipment has a point cost as well. We tried to keep the basic rules pretty simple and streamlined, while the equipment cards introduce new levels of complexity. This aspect is somewhat similar to a collectible card game.&#10;&#10;The alpha rules can be download from here:&#10;http://www.robotviking.com/2009/06/project-death-race-open-alpha-playtest-rules/&#10;&#10;",

Throughout the forest, you can find signs that animals live here: Under the tree lies a gnawed fir cone, and there are tracks left by little paws on the wayside. In winter you can clearly see the tracks through the snow. But it's also easy to find signs on animals in summer if you pay attention. However, you need to know a lot if you want to identify the animals that have passed by.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 game board&#10;     8 animal cards&#10;     4 track searchers&#10;     16 feed pieces&#10;     4 info sheets&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A player selects from one of the first nine categories above and a question number between 1-30.&#10;&#10;After each correct answer, the player can stop or pick another question (the rules do not allow for a different category to be chosen). The first correct answer awards 1 &quot;stage dollar&quot; with each subsequent correct answer doubling it, up to $64 for seven correct answers. An incorrect answer at any point forfeits the money to a Jack Pot which starts at $25.&#10;&#10;After all players have had an opportunity to answer questions, the Quiz Master selects a question from booklet #10 for the Jack Pot, after which the players have 60 seconds to write down the correct answer. The Jack Pot is split between all players who have written the correct answer; the rules do not state what to do if the Jack Pot is not won.&#10;&#10;At least two editions were released (First Series and Second Series). The gameplay is largely similar to Take It or Leave It, released in 1942, the only major difference being the usage of quiz booklets in this game versus a spinner in that one.&#10;&#10;",

In the beginning, this can be done in any position where a disk doesn't touch any other disk. When the board becomes too full, the disks must be placed on the edge of the board, then pushed in with a wooden bar. In this way, all other disks that are hanging over the edge of that particular edge of the board, are pushed back in as well. Disks that fall over an edge are returned to the player of the respective color. Neutral disks are handed to any player (black disks) or to the player whose turn it is (red disks). The first player to place all his/her disks on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;A small number of copies of Schiebung were published as a &quot;Test-Edition&quot; by Edition Perlhuhn in 2009.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Interesting tourist simulation set in Washington DC.  Seems to have been put together by a company that was interested in tour guides (Macomas, Ltd).&#10;&#10;Players take turns choosing a type of venue to visit (historical, presidential, entertainment, bars, diners, sports, etc).  Then they roll a six-sided die to determine which of the six places is available for them to attend.  The result shows them how much time and money must be expended along with the resulting victory points gained (which is a straight formula based on time and money).  Some locations can only be visited at night (and no later than 9:00 to start); others are only daytime affairs.  If the tourist returns to their hotel too late, they are docked victory points. The game ends after two days (four segments of night/day).&#10;&#10;Speaking of hotels, players also decide which area they wish to stay in (close in, convenient but expensive, or farther out), which affects their total allotment of money.  Players also choose transportation modes (walk, taxi, rental car, subway) where the time/money trade off rears its head again.&#10;&#10;There are a few cards that players can use to augment their scoring.&#10;&#10;In the end, it's a move-and-roll game, rather than vice versa, and it's very spreadsheet-like in that players log their comings, goings, time, and points on a grid/scoresheet.&#10;&#10;",

Players begin with a pawn on the square called &quot;THE BEGINNING&quot; on the trail of the CHART,  with the object being to get one's pawn to &quot;JOURNEYS END&quot; by answering questions correctly.&#10;&#10;The directions state that  &quot;this is an exciting contest which will afford hours of pleasant entertainment and a wealth of Bible knowledge&quot;.&#10;&#10;When a question is answered correctly the question sheet is turned over showing a number. A correct answer has a value of one more than the number showing on the card. If the question is not answered correctly the player still scores the value of the number. The game rewards the &quot;Bible student&quot; but permits the uninformed to enjoy the game. &quot;You learn as you play.&quot; The first to reach the 'JOURNEYS END' by exact count wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player discards face up to the center, one card at a time that they do not want and picks up one card that they do want to match their hand. When all cards are correctly matched, the one having the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;Or&#10;&#10;You seperate all of the state and capital cards, placing the Capital cards on the table face up. The State cards are dealt to the players to form a hand. The dealer shouts &quot;GO!&quot; Every player picks up matching Capital cards as fast as they can. The first player to match his State cards with their matching Capital cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Death or Freedom is a game of gladiatorial combat in ancient Rome, from Steve Barber Models.&#10;&#10;A bloodthirsty, fast playing game that recreates the carnage of the Roman amphitheatres. This game can be played by 2 or more Players and can either be played as one off single combats or as it is intended as Tournaments, where your Gladiator Characters battle for their lives, with heavily wounded victors being retired or succumbing to their wounds after the combat, and your victorious Gladiators battling to become champions and win you more money and infamy.&#10;&#10;The basis of the game, is that you take on the role of a Lanista (proprietor of a Troop of Gladiators), with the sole aim of making as much money as you can out of the spilling of blood in the arena. Each Player starts with 1000 Denarii, (metal coins supplied with the game), this money is then used to buy the Gladiators that you start the first round with, and for placing side bets before each fight begins. Hopefully as you win your fights, you will increase your wealth, and be able to replenish your killed fighters with new ones, maybe even Essedarius chariots or Equites.&#10;&#10;The game has a quick and brutal feel about it, with limbs being hacked off and savage Special Moves that can be used by your Champions. Many combats can be played in only 10 minutes, though more skilled Gladiators, or larger battles may take up to 1 hour. There are rules for Chariots, Horsemen, Wild Beasts, Unusual types of Gladiators as well as for the more common types, such as the Retiarius and the Veles and the Myrmillo.&#10;&#10;The combats take place on a specially designed sandy coloured Arena Playing Area (supplied with the game). This is marked out with Hexes and a special mechanism for Chariot movements. The use of Hexes makes the movement and attacks on the flanks quick and easy to work out. The Arena Playing Area also has Number and Dropped Weapon markers, which can be helpful in larger battles when it can be hard to remember what order players fight in.&#10;&#10;To sum up, I wanted this game to be fast and simple to play. This was difficult to do due to the numerous vastly different fighting methods, but I am very pleased with the results. The game bag contains all the things that you will need to play the game except the miniatures. The rule book has a ghostly sepia colour cover and has diagrams to help explain the harder rules. This game will bring out the tactician in you, as tactics play a vital part as the rounds progress. The more you play the faster it becomes and the more you will find that you have learnt since the last time you played it. So, if you fancy your chances in the sands of the colloseum, try it out!&#10;&#10;&ndash;Description from publisher / designer&#10;&#10;",

The game is far too luck driven for repeated plays - but it has superb production values, including 3d features (the Target, Deer and Treasury) and a wonderfully illustrated board.&#10;&#10;The game is for 2-4 players. Each player chooses a corner of the board, which is used to hold the players pegs (&quot;arrows&quot;) and any money that the player wins.&#10;&#10;Each player takes a member of Robin Hood's band (Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck, Little John or Maid Marian) and places them at the &quot;Start&quot; square. Each player then uses the spinner in centre of the board; instead of numbers, the spinner points to different coloured squares, Each players playing piece is then moved around the board to the next relevant coloured square,&#10;&#10;When a player lands on a square with instructions on, they must be obeyed. Players crossing Treasury Road collect one coin from the Treasury.&#10;&#10;If any player lands on a square with a target on it, all players proceed to the Archery ground for an Archery contest. Each player has 3 shots (spins of the central spinner) in succession, their pegs (&quot;arrows&quot;) are placed in the target according to the colour indicated by the spinner. The player with the highest score collects a coin from each of the other players.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on a square with an arrow then that player must pay one coin to the players nearest to them on the board.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on a square marked &quot;Golden Chance&quot; they spin the central spinner to determine the result:&#10;&#10;- if spinner points at the Treasury collect 2 coins&#10;- if spinner points at a Name collect 1 coin&#10;- if spinner points at the Deer lose 2 coins to the Treasury&#10;- if spinner points at the Target an Archery contest takes place&#10;&#10;If a player runs out of coins to pay a forfeit they miss a turn.&#10;&#10;If a player lands in &quot;Go to London&quot; they collect a coin from the Treasury.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to collect 10 coins and reach the &quot;Go to London&quot; square.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simple anagram game from the 1920s, produced by G.Delgado Ltd of London as part of the Union Jack series of &quot;Puzzling Pastimes&quot;.&#10;&#10;The games consists of 8 identical cards (games), each of which is printed with 20 anagrams of common cuts of meat found in a butchers shop. The purpose of the game is for each player to have a card, and identify as many of the anagrams as they can within a set time.&#10;&#10;Good production values - cards are heavy duty and well printed - but limited replay value, as once you have worked out the anagrams on the card there is no point in playing the game again as you know all of the answers.&#10;&#10;Part of a series of similar games which include &quot;Half hour in a Fairy World&quot;, &quot;A Grocer's Mistake&quot;, &quot;Careless Chemist&quot;, &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs Jollyfolks Supper Party&quot;, &quot;The Sportyboy Game&quot; and &quot;The Humorous Haberdasher&quot;.&#10;&#10;Advertised as &quot;a clever and interesting game.

A life-and-death struggle between single-celled organisms involves two players in a rapid action contest of dice and strategy. Each opponent attempts to inflict the foreign cell by exposing it to a carrier virus while defensively contracting its own cell wall and shifting its nucleus out of danger. As in life, fate is decided by aggression, instinct and luck.&#10;&#10;Description:&#10;&#10;In Infecta each player controls a cell made up of a nucleus piece and many cell wall pieces. Each player also controls six virions (virus particles) which can destroy other pieces; the object is to destroy the opponent's nucleus, all the opponent's virions, or all the opponent's cell walls.&#10;&#10;On a turn the active player rolls two dice and moves pieces accordingly. Virions can only move in straight lines, and each one must use the full amount rolled on one die. The other pieces can split dice and move in any combination of directions desired. Rolling doubles entitles a player to another turn (though this cannot be repeated) and also to restore a destroyed virion under certain conditions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Games of Anceint Rome&#10;&#10;Familia Gladiatorius is a simple gaming system for recreating the murrus, the gladiatorial combat, using miniature figures. In the larger campaign game, the player takes the role of a ludus, the operator of a gladiatorial school. The ludus owned a number of slaves trained to fight as gladiators. These slaves and their trainers (often retired gladiators themselves) made up the familia gladiatorius of the ludus. Normally, the ludus was contracted by the editor to provide fighters for the murrus. It was a risky business, and its practitioners were reviled by Roman society. Yet fortunes could be made by providing a bloodthirsty populace with bloody entertainment.&#10;&#10;",

Units are squad, company and individual AFVs.&#10;The Battle of Wadi Saluki was a long time coming. The units of the IDF 401st Brigade had been waiting for weeks for orders as they sat taking incoming Hezbollah attacks. Orders had come in twice to proceed and twice were cancelled. The canyon like Saluki is a &quot;gateway to the Litani river&quot;, an essential objective in southern Lebanon assigned to the brigade before the cease-fire went into action. On August 11, just before 1500 hours, orders came in, but at this late stage, made no sense to the brigade staff. Crossing the Saluki meant the troops and tanks had to climb a steep hill while exposed to attack from mountains on every side. Understanding the risk to tanks, Division 162 deployed its Nahal Brigade infantry on the high ground outside the villages Ghandouriya and Farun, to provide cover for the armored column advancing below. The distance from one plateau to another across the steep valley is only a half mile. Both towns that the IDF attempted to screen were still in enemy hands and both a good half mile from the edge of the Saluki Valley. Russian-made AT- 14 Kornet anti-tank missiles waited en-masse in excellent firing positions. IDF tanks would attempt to climb along a narrow dirt track just below this area! There would be no air support nor artillery support. Thus, began the IDF tank assault with its latest Merkava 4 tank, 24 of them, which some called murderous and suicidal.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shortstack consists of a deck of 60 square cards, each containing a different comic panel portraying a scene from the journal of Major Robert Shortstack. Three different games are detailed in the included booklet:&#10;&#10;Game 1 (3-6 players) has the players dealt a hand of 5 cards, then redrawing and exchanging cards until they have created a cohesive 4-panel strip at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;Game 2 (4-6 players) has the players dealt 6 cards, which they then must create a 4-panel comic strip as quickly as possible. The judge will then choose the best out of the first 3 submitted.&#10;&#10;Game 3 (2-4 players) has the players dealt a hand of 5 cards. One random card from the deck is placed in the middle, and each player on their turn must place a connected card next to the one of the cards on the table. If player does not have a card to connect they must draw a card from the deck. The player who gets rid of all their cards first is the winner.&#10;&#10;Playing with the cards minus the game mechanics is also encouraged.&#10;&#10;",

If a player lands on either the &quot;Bird&quot; or &quot;Good Fairy&quot;, they can safely pass through the forest without having to follow the directions on the monster or obstacle spaces. If a player does not land on either of these spaces before entering the forest, they have to follow the instructions on the board.&#10;&#10;There is no pass for the cave. If a player spins a number that will cause him to land on a space another player occupies, he forfeits that turn. No two counters may occupy the same space.&#10;&#10;The player first reaching Fairyland by an exact count WINS THE GAME!&#10;&#10;",
