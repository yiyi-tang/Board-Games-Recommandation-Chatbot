It can be played by any group size, from 2 players to as many as you can fit around a table.&#10;&#10;You start the game by laying out a 4x4 grid of word cards. Cards have a point value from 1 to 3. Teams take turns trying to capture one of the cards by asking the speaker a single question, without using any form of the word on the card. If the speaker says the word in its response, the team captures that card and scores the points.&#10;&#10;Whenever a team misses with their question, they must add a bonus point token to the card, increasing its value. Whenever a team captures a card, they add a bonus point token to any of the cards next to the captured card. The first team to score 16 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Hey Robot rewards general knowledge, linguistic dexterity, and the ability to reverse-engineer the algorithms that power the smart devices we've brought into our homes. It's the first board game designed for humans and AI to play together.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Indagar was thrust into chaos when the Reaper burst into the mortal world, spawning a cataclysm that has left large swaths of the continent in ruin. A once stable republic that spanned the land has been destroyed, and in its wake, some factions are vying to be new rulers while others just want to be left alone. Meanwhile, warped monsters and terrible Cabalists roam the earth pent on destruction. No matter what side you're on, the time has come to grab arms, prepare spells, and join the war for Indagar.&#10;&#10;War for Indagar is a fast-paced, 4x strategy game that includes four distinct factions for 1-4 players, along with an engaging AI. Players select powerful heroes to represent their armies, choose unique strategies to tailor their gameplay, and use spells and abilities to gain control over the battlefield and &mdash; ultimately &mdash; the Spirit Well at its center.&#10;&#10;After generating a dynamic board of face-down hexagon tiles, players take turns exploring the land, building outposts, gathering resources, and waging an intense battle against other players and the AI-driven monsters. Unlike many 4x games, War for Indagar puts combat at the center of the struggle, with heroes squaring off in epic combat and using abilities and spells unlocked as they gain experience. To participate in combat, players roll dice based on attack and defense characteristics; do enough damage and you send your opponent into retreat and gain the land they were defending.&#10;&#10;Games of War for Indagar last for ten turns or until a player earns 10 primacy points. Primacy is earned by claiming land with new outposts, defeating the enemy champion, or mining the precious spirits from the well at the center of the battlefield. Points can be won and lost in this seesaw battle to dominate the land, so call your banners, summon your champions, and prepare for the war for Indagar!&#10;&#10;",

NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East imposed the longest peace since the end of the Napoleonic Wars. But as the Cold War ends, this armed stability will end as well. The nations of Europe have many long-standing territorial disputes and historic animosities that only now can erupt into violence. For years, Romania and Hungary could put aside their differences in the face of a greater threat from NATO. Greece and Turkey stood uncomfortably together against the potential threat of the Warsaw Pact.&#10;Now, the age of unsteady friends has passed. Battlefield: Europe explores seven potential European flashpoints. Each could turn violent at any time in the next ten years.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The animals have escaped from the zoo, and it's up to the zookeepers to get everyone back in their cages &mdash; but lots of things can happen while you're chasing critters...&#10;&#10;In Zooscape, originally released as Curio Collectors (&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#233;&#170;&#168;&#232;&#145;&#163;&#229;&#184;&#130;), you must prove yourself the best zookeeper by rounding up animals worth the most points, but remember that all the animals need enough space in their cage to stay happy! Shove too many in one cage, and they'll be worth almost nothing to you.&#10;&#10;In each round, someone deals a line of twelve cards face up on the table; each card depicts an animal (a curio in the original version) along with a point value and a limit. The starting player splits the line in two by choosing a dividing point. Each player holds two cards showing the left or right group, and each player chooses, then simultaneously reveals which group of cards they want. If only one player chooses a side, they take all the cards in that group and add them to their personal tableau. If a side is chosen by more than one player, however, then one of the players who chose it splits that group into two smaller groups, then everyone who originally chose this group secretly votes again for which group they want. This process repeats with each group until either each player has taken some number of cards or groups have been reduced to single cards and two or more players are still voting to take them; in this case, those single cards are placed in a special pile. At the start of a round, the starting player adds a special card to the line-up and whoever wins this card collects all of the animals in this special pile.&#10;&#10;Players complete three rounds this way, then score points. If a group of cards has exceeded the limit on it &mdash; say, by collecting four cards when the limit is three &mdash; then the owner of these cards scores only 1 point per card instead of the point value for each card. Some cards in the game allow you to remove cards from your collection, possibly allowing you to stay under the limit and score more points. You might also start trying not to win cards so as not to spoil the value of what you've already collected. (In Curio Collectors, you would effectively crash the market value for an item by trying to sell too many of them at one time.) Whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Zooscape has also been published as Kimono, with players collecting Japan-related collectibles and cultural objects.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mazescape is a clever and fascinating maze game for one player that will challenge even the most active minds.  The Cryo-C version is designed by Pablo C&eacute;spedes and Victor Hugo Cisternas, authors of Tesoros del Rey Pirata, and illustrated by David Yuyo Correa.&#10;&#10;When the mainframe computer of the supply ship unexpectedly awakens from suspended animation, something&rsquo;s probably going to go wrong.  You&rsquo;re still in outer space, there&rsquo;s nobody by your side, and the central reactor&rsquo;s alarm won&rsquo;t stop sounding.  Upon exiting your capsule you realize that everyone else has disappeared.  Who, or better yet, what has taken them?  To find out, sharpen your wits, patience and powers of observation.&#10;&#10;The Mazescape saga introduces a completely unique concept that fans of logic and puzzles will love.  In this original game from Devir, you will place a map on the table and look for the compass rose as the starting point of the maze.  Using the wooden stylus that comes with the game, you&rsquo;ll trace the white pathways, maintaining contact with the maze at all times, and you&rsquo;ll open and close sections of the map while looking for the exit point of the Impossible Triangle.  Pass under bridges, climb staircases, and keep your head from spinning until the exit point takes you to the next scenario.&#10;&#10;Each Mazescape box contains seven different challenges to face.  The first maze is a relatively accessible challenge, and little by little the mazes become increasingly difficult until the final elegant explosion of pathways, which can only be untangled by the sharpest minds.&#10;&#10;Moreover, each map includes a series of secondary challenges that allow you to travel through a second time, giving each set of maps a high degree of re-playability.  Look for all of the hidden treasures in the seven maps.  And the portable format is easy to play anywhere; all you need is a place to set the map and the stylus to start your journey.  But beware, nobody said that escaping from the labyrinth would be easy!&#10;&#10;Mazescape Cryo-C offers the most advanced challenges of the Mazescape saga, including the most complex mazes to date.  Are you up for the challenge?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sinoda is an abstract strategy game played using 4-sided dice as the pieces on a beautiful &quot;flower of life&quot; pattern board. Players must capture the most points worth of pieces from their opponents.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player may move a piece OR rotate a piece to increase or decrease the top number by 1. The number at the top is the piece's movement value, indicating how many spaces it must move (should you choose to move it), but it is also the points value of the piece awarded to the opposing player if they capture it. Captures are made by finishing a move on top of another player's piece. During a move, a piece may not move over another piece, or back through a space it just went through.&#10;  &#10;The game ends immediately when:&#10;&bull; All players have only one piece on the board, or...&#10;&bull; A player has lost their last piece on the board, or...&#10;&bull; A player has captured 6 opposing pieces&#10;&#10;Once the game ends, players add up their captured points. Since the winner is the player with the most captured points and not the player who has captured the most pieces, it is possible to lose all of your pieces and still win! There is also a special win by Sinoda that happens in 2 player games.&#10;&#10;Sinoda plays differently at each player count of 2, 3, 4 &amp; 6 players. Each still feels like Sinoda but everyone should experience the various player cunts to feel the tactical and social nuances. 6 is unique as it plays like a social game that meets abstract strategy. It has lots of banter with deep discussions and needed trust for cunning plans. A time will come, that makes you wonder if now your opponent will go this turn alone, stick to the plan or turn on you. The opposite end is the 2-player. A clean abstract strategy with deep thought and game changing moments. Don't forget team play. You don't add your team's points together at the end. Any member of your team wins the entire team wins. This allows for more aggressive play with certain team members.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Six Day War: 1967 is a wargame of Arab-Israeli War of June 1967.&#10;&#10;There are two players in the game, each commanding a Front of the Israeli Army against various Arab opponents. One commands the Sinai Front; the second commands the Eastern Front. Each player also commands the Arab forces facing the other player (his opponent.) The game is designed in this manner owing to the massive qualitative superiority of Israeli forces in this war. The assumption of the game is that an Israeli victory was generally inevitable, so the intent is to place the players in a situation in which they have to compete with each other on both sides to win the greatest possible victory on their own Front.&#10; The map is divided into two sectors, one for each Front. Only units of that Front may operate in that sector. There are additional units, called Reserves, which can possibly be assigned to either Front. The objective of each player is to score the most Victory Points in terms of seizing objectives and destroying enemy units at the lowest possible cost. Meanwhile, the player will be using the Arab forces facing the other player to delay or even stop that Front.&#10; The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) of Israel and the surrounding regions from the Golan Heights to the Suez canal (and all of the Sinai), and one counter-sheet (228 counters) representing all of the Israeli and Arab forces, color-coded to apportion them by their respect Front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Published with Modern War #4&#10;&#10;",

Will you perish there in the hinterlands or will you make it out with more than your life?&#10;&#10;There is something out there. Something worth seeking for, but it will be up to you to determine what precisely that is. Maybe it&rsquo;s purpose. Maybe it&rsquo;s knowledge. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just nothing but trouble.&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s not up to me. So, go on. Get out there and seek, before someone or something makes the decisions for you.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Rove, an immersive campaign adventure for 1-4 players. Explore the high fantasy world of Chorus, a wild and vibrant planet full of flora, fauna, and other things&hellip; that all want to kill or eat you. Rovers, a loosely-formed collective of sojourners and adventurers, struggle to maintain a tenuous balance. The natural predators of Chorus roam the wilds, threatening to prevent the people of Chorus from thriving.&#10;&#10;As Rovers, players will adventure through a branching story filled with consequence, where choices affect both individual adventures and the state of the world. But beware, the paths left behind don&rsquo;t fade away. They linger and fester until what was once the promise of a threat evolves into something else entirely.&#10;&#10;Along the way, players will unlock new skills, equipment, and classes in strategic, turn-based combat. Adversaries will not stand idly by, though, and let Rovers traverse Chorus without hindrance. A unique behavior table will dictate how adversaries react based on the state of the encounter. This extra dimension of gameplay demands more careful consideration from the players without increasing upkeep. Spend less time managing the game and more time playing it. And Rove&rsquo;s inspired skill card mechanic makes learning the game easy but provides complex strategic decisions for even the most veteran of players.&#10;&#10;Master these mechanics and work together as a team. It might just be enough for you Rovers to leave a lasting mark in a world that forgets quickly and forgives rarely.&#10;&#10;",

Instead of creating words (and then losing a friendship over an argument about whether yex is a real word) players strive to create sequences which match any of the various face-up Sequence Cards. The sequences on the Sequence Cards range from simple 4-hexagon sequence to more complex, longer ones.&#10;&#10;Special-Play hexagons add variety to the game by allowing players to do more than just place hexagons  onto the board. Here are some of the Special-Play hexagons included in hexaGONE:&#10;&#10;Swap-agon: swap the positions of any two hexagons on the board.&#10;Draw-agon: immediately draw 2 hexagons. You may exceed your hand size limit for this turn only.&#10;Move-agon: move one hexagon on the board to a new location&#10;Bomb-agon: remove a face up Sequence Card then you may immediately draw a new one&#10;&#10;",

With a hand so small, rounds go really fast and sometimes they even last only a few seconds.&#10;&#10;The detail that makes the charm of the game lies in the announcement &quot;Trut!&rdquo; which is done verbally or by clapping a hand on the table. At any time in the round, as long as a player holds a card in his hand, whomever &quot;Truts&quot; simply announces to the opposing team he is certain to win the round. Of course, he can bluff. He's got 2 options then: to give up or take up the challenge! Knowing that winning a &quot;Trut&quot; can lead to a greater... or to a huge loss.&#10;&#10;A game lasts between 5 and 10 minutes, but the pace is really fast, and the game is so addictive that players often easily play several games.&#10;&#10;In 2017, Robin Red Games released a version of TRUT which adds a bunch of cards with special effects.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Mikugames website:)&#10;&#10;On November 30th, 1939 the Soviet Red Army crossed the Finnish border in attempt to conquer the whole country within a few weeks. Quite soon, it became evident that the Finns, despite totally outnumbered, were not an easy match. They were better equipped for the cold winter to come than the opponent. Ski capability was high and moving in deep forest was no problem. On the other hand, the Soviet troops were scared to death of the forest and stayed as close as possible to the few roads.&#10;&#10;The Motti (Finnish term for &ldquo;encirclement&rdquo;) tactic became famous around the world and a great sympathy for the small country up in the north grew in many countries as the war went on. Soon, places like Suomussalmi, Tolvaj&auml;rvi, Kuhmo and Kollaa, to name a few, became famous for the heroic Finns fighting against overwhelming odds.&#10;&#10;The situation was not good for Stalin and his communist regime. Allied intervention was very possible and the prestige over the greatest army to date, The Red Army, was shaking. He also knew that Hitler was studying the campaign very carefully, making notes for every weakness in the old and poor doctrine of the RKKA.&#10;&#10;On March 13th, 1940, Finland had no other choice but to agree on the tough peace terms to follow. The Winter War had ended, but who won, or was it a stalemate? However, Finland kept its independence because the mighty neighbour in the east failed to take Helsinki among other vital objects, as planned.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;The first game of the trilogy to be released is the famous Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union, which is often referred to as an epic battle between David and Goliath. Historically the campaign lasted for 105 days, but will you as the Finnish side be able to last that long, or maybe longer? The game can last up to 16 turns (Dec. I '39 - Mar. IV '40), but in the 3rd volume (The Lapland War), there will be an extended option with a possible Allied Intervention. Vol.1 Winter War will include special features like Soviet Prestige and Finnish Morale.&#10;&#10;The object for the Soviet side is to capture as many important cities and factories as possible, as well as destroy the Finnish Army in an attempt to make the Finnish Morale Status plunge, which means the onset of peace negotiations. But time is not on the Red Army's side, a slow advance lowers the Soviet prestige, which can cause a negative outcome.&#10;&#10;Unit Counters&#10;The game will include eight countersheets in a total of 2.128 die-cut unit counters. Ground units are written in standard Nato symbols, while Air and Naval units have correct silhouettes.&#10;&#10;The Mapboard&#10;The mapboard will be 100 cm x 140 cm (39&rdquo; x 55&rdquo;) in four pieces, depicting Finland and its' vicinity in a &quot;Winterized&quot; colour.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;A 48-page coloured rule book includes basic, advanced and optional game rules.&#10;&#10;Order of Battle (OOB)&#10;Two OOB&rsquo;s are included, one Finnish and one Soviet. Both in full colour. &#10;A lot of sources have been used to make them as historically correct as possible. Also, four Small Scenarios have been included: (1) Salla, (2) Kuhmo-Suomussalmi, (3) Ladoga Karelia, and (4) Karelian Isthmus. For added feeling, the OOB's are written in their native language (Soviet with Cyrillic) with usually the correct unit abbreviation and then translated into English in parenthesis.&#10;&#10;Production Volume&#10;460 boxed copies were produced.&#10;&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;    Main Campaign&#10;    Extended Campaign (longer play and with Foreign Intervention)&#10;    4 Small Scenarios (#1 Kuusamo-Salla; #2 Kuhmo-Suomussalmi; #3 Ladoga Karelia; and #4 Karelian Isthmus)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

She demanded the soul of one of them. She will take her prize by a murderer who lives among them.

Your objective is twofold: Ensure that the murderer doesn't end up in your district at the end of night, and become the one with the most points to be proclaimed the new heir of the crown. To do that, you put in game the characters from your hand to your district, take advantage of their abilities, and expel any character that seems to be suspicious.

Each card shows one of six witnesses on its back and a witness viewing one of the five suspects on its front. On a turn, the active player reveals two cards in the grid. If they match, the player then turns over a third card. If all three cards show show the same suspect, the cards are collected and placed face-up next to the grid. In all other cases, that player turns the cards face-down once again, then flips over one of the ten timing cards, each showing Sherlock's nemesis Moriarty.&#10;&#10;If all ten Moriarty cards are flipped, then the players lose the game. If, however, the players remove cards from the grid until only three remain, they have successfully identified the culprit &ndash; that is, the suspect who remains &ndash; and can claim victory.&#10;&#10;A competitive variant is included in the rules which have players competing to collect witness cards. An additional variant rewards points to the player who holds (or doesn't hold) the suspect eventually identified as the culprit.&#10;&#10;The Sherlock box also includes eight bonus cards, a new dinosaur and action cards for a fifth player for Ilopeli's Jurassik.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from ATO website:)&#10;&#10;Americans hear it on the news and wonder. July 12 in Ireland has become a day of pride and anger, lawsuits and fisticuffs. Called &ldquo;The Twelfth,&rdquo; it commemorates the Battle of the Boyne, 1690, when William of Orange (hence today&rsquo;s Protestant &ldquo;Orangemen&rdquo;) and his polyglot army ended the Jacobite hopes for James II to regain the throne and allow (at least) more religious freedom for Catholic Ireland.&#10;&#10;In one sense, The Boyne might be considered the last battle of the English Civil War&mdash;a conflict that had spilled into both Scotland and Ireland along the way. And it might be considered one of the last battles of the Protestant Reformation, since much support on both sides had to do with which religion other countries wished to prevail, which is evident when you find that William&rsquo;s army included Danes, Dutch, English, Huguenots, Welsh and Protestant Irish. James&rsquo; army was mostly Catholic Irish but also included a brigade of crack French infantry and some of the best cavalry in Europe.&#10;&#10;The Boyne also represents a key transition point in military technology&hellip;the last of the matchlocks and pikes and first of the flintlocks, a final time when cavalry caracole competed with pressing home a charge&#10;&#10;So what&rsquo;s with &lsquo;Lillibulero&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s a song that was a popular tune before this time but became locked with the whole Irish campaign. Trust us, you have heard the tune. It used to be used by the BBC, various British army groups, and the movie Barry Lyndon, and has been featured in alternative lyrics versions for several wars since&mdash;including the ACW and WW2&mdash;and in Ulster folk tunes. It was &ldquo;said to have sung James II out of three kingdoms,&rdquo; and is still part of the Orange marches mentioned above.&#10;&#10;What about the game? Philip Jelley&rsquo;s design brings us area movement for the broad area of eastern Ireland relevant to the battle, with units representing the various regiments, battalions, squadrons, and batteries that fought in the battle. Each turn represents roughly one hour of time, with weather, mist, and gunsmoke affecting command and control and unit activations. Scenarios are included for the full battle with historical deployments, the full battle with free-set-up, and for specific parts of the battle (for shorter playtime). Also included is a smaller battle &ldquo;delaying action&rdquo; that some people say is what James should have done, plus, there are optional rules for units who could have been involved or who had pressing reasons to NOT be involved (Even William might not be there!). You&rsquo;ll have plenty of chances to try various ways of heading off &ldquo;The Troubles&rdquo; of three centuries ago, or of pressing William&rsquo;s claims and making a truly &ldquo;United Kingdom.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Map - One full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet (plus a second half-sized map covering the battle of Aughrim)&#10;Counters - 176 full color 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces&#10;Rules length - 12 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;Complexity - Low&#10;Solitaire suitability - Low&#10;Playing time - Up to 3 hours&#10;&#10;Design - Philip Jelley&#10;Development - Lembit Tohver&#10;Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;",

Each card has a different point total, and the first player to 100 points wins.&#10;&#10;Each player brings his or her own deck to play, and the decks get hopelessly intermingled during play. Half the fun of the xXxenophile game is gaining cards that you did not originally have.&#10;&#10;The cards are not painted in an insulting way, are no more demeaning to women than they are to men, and there is material for people of all sexual preferences within the artwork. The game is still not appropriate for children by the standards of its country of origin (the United States).&#10;&#10;Cheapass Games&rsquo;s James Ernest, the game designer who designed Kill Doctor Lucky and Button Men, created the design for play of the game.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to standard colonial era actions, special rules are included for adding various science fiction elements to the plot, including, but not limited to, steam conveyances, fabulous inventions, glorious weapons, and strange creatures from the depths of the jungle or the core of the Earth.&#10;&#10;In G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T., units generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters. A player normally controls one or two units. A player may also control one or two vehicles and their crews. G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. includes rules for creating Main Characters with somewhat more detail than the Extras. The games then are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.&#10;&#10;Command and control is accomplished through a card-based turn system. Movement is based on moving individual figures. Firing is done by figure as well, but the firing procedure is very quick. Morale is accomplished through a unique, stateless system that treats loss of cohesion in an novel way.&#10;&#10;Detailed charts are provided for creating personal weapons, heavy weapons, vehicles, and fantastic creatures. The concept used in G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. is that of imperfect mechanization -- machines don't always work as intended. This often adds a bit of excitement and humor to the games.&#10;&#10;The authors of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules. Instead the rules allow for the generation of vehicles, weapons, and creatures that allow groups of players to tailor the rules to their perception of Victorian science fiction. As a result, the rules are flexible.&#10;&#10;The system now includes The G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. Compendium which includes most of the expansion books.  It adds some new material and revises some of the old material.  It is 190 pages of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. information.&#10;&#10;",

Let your adversaries watch the sparks fly from under the wheels of your dashing train!&#10;&#10;Every turn in this game is divided into two phases. First is the planning phase, in which players plan their moves by playing move cards. Next is the action phase; this is the heart of the game. Players reveal their move cards one by one and perform actions (load cargo, deliver cargo, upgrade train, switch cargo order on the stations, pick up a new contract). There are many possibilities; players must choose wisely and plan ahead their moves. The gameboard is made from cards and players change it during the game.&#10;&#10;",

Who can help Gary memorize the best way to the target mouse hole and collect the most pieces of cheese?&#10;&#10;The bottom of the Gary Gouda box contains the game board, which resembles an apartment with 16 rooms arranged in a square and archways connecting each pair of rooms. Before the game begins, players slide archway tiles into the walls to adjust the heights of the various archways at random. The cat token is placed in front of any orange mouse hole to keep his eyes out for Gary.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player wants to move Gary from a corner of the house, pick up at least one pieces of cheese, and make it safely to the target corner without being seen by Kiki. To set up a player's turn, he draws four cheese slices, then places them in the rooms designated on the slices; he rolls the color die to determine where Gary starts and where he must move to. He is then free to move Gary through any archways possible &ndash; as long as he doesn't enter Kiki's sight &ndash; to reach one or more pieces of cheese. Gary eats this cheese immediately, with the player stacking Gary on the cheese slice to make the mouse fatter. If Gary ever gets stuck trying to fit through an archway, then the player's turn ends and any cheese on Gary is removed from the game; if a player reaches the corner, he claims any cheese eaten.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player can't place out four slices of cheese.

We have replaced the hex-maps typical of World War II games with three beautiful, yet abstracted maps, representing the Pacific Theater and allowing for endless battlefield customization.&#10;&#10;A simple solitaire system recreates small firefights (five to ten units per side) over a bevy of scenarios, including beach assaults, riverbank defense, random jungle patrols, raids on AA Gun emplacements and radio stations, and a campaign linking the missions together. Blind chit draws and die rolls, combined with artfully crafted charts create an impressive &ldquo;artificial intelligence,&rdquo; imbuing the game with true fog of war.&#10;&#10;A fast paced and exciting solitaire World War II game, Rifles in the Pacific offers electrifying tactical challenges in a tiny package.&#10;&#10;Rifles in the Pacific includes:&#10;&#10;A full sheet of beautiful, 1&quot;-square die-cut counters&#10;    3 Abstracted maps representing jungles, beaches&#10;    Four Armies: USMC, Japanese SNLF and IJA, Commonwealth &#10;    Eight Action-Packed Missions and a campaign that uses them&#10;&#10;The game components are fully compatible with Rifles in the Ardennes.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After a life of raids and robberies, Captain Morgan retired from piracy. He created a magic map that would remind him where he buried his ill-gotten gains. He tore the map in many pieces to foil those who would try to find his treasures. Unfortunately for the old pirate, he was cursed by a sorceress many years ago. This curse has turned his torn-up map into a guide for others to find his treasures!&#10;&#10;You have come into possession of many pieces of Morgan's map. Every time the fragments are rearranged, they magically point to the right place to dig! But other pirates have found parts of the magic map as well, so now you must race your fellow pirates to see who can collect the most valuable treasures before the map fades to dust forever.&#10;&#10;Morgan's Magic Map is played over a series of turns in which players use map cards to locate where Captain Morgan has hidden his treasures. To set up, place the twenty map tiles in a 4x5 grid, with water and land edges always being adjacent to one another. Most map tiles include a reference point, such as The Tomb, The 3 Columns, or Big Nose Bay. Each player starts with two doubloons and four map cards in hand; each map card shows a reference point, a distance from the reference point, and a bonus icon.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can take a map tile that has a free edge and move it elsewhere, as long as the map stays in one piece, water touches water, and no pirate is on the tile. Next, you can move your pirate &mdash; which starts in a corner of the map &mdash; up to two spaces orthogonally. Then if you meet the condition on any map cards in hand, you can play them since you've followed their directions to find treasure. If, for example, a map card shows The Tomb and has a 3 on it, then you can play that map card if you are three (orthogonal) spaces away from The Tomb. Treasure cards come in six colors, and five cards are available on a treasure board, with the more valuable cards being deeper on the board. If you play three map cards on a turn, then you can take any one of the topmost three cards. The deeper you dig, the more doubloons you earn along with the treasure!&#10;&#10;Each map card has a bonus on it, and once you've played a map card, you keep it in front of you until you use the bonus, whether to move an extra map tile, walk farther with your pirate, or dig deeper when you locate treasure.&#10;&#10;Once the deck of treasure cards is exhausted, the game ends. For each of the six treasure types, whoever has the most of that type earns a 6 doubloon bonus, with tied players splitting the bonus. Sum up the doubloons you collected during the game, bonuses, and the value of the treasures themselves to see who ended up the richest pirate.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are a captain heading a crew of pirates. At first, it is just a small band, but you will gradually expand it into a large company. The winner of the game is the one who has the most victory points when the game ends.&#10;&#10;The system is like the system of Dominion. It's called &quot;Deck building&quot;.&#10;&#10;The object is a player collect the VP card by using a crew card, item card and a treasure card.&#10;This cards are able to use any own turn. And the VP card is added as the more point card.&#10;&#10;The difference of Dominion is a player use a markers and resource chips.&#10;The player put Markers on island boards.&#10;&#10;There are several &quot;quests&quot; on each island, and players put their markers on them. A quest is completed each time it has as many markers as it requires. When a quest is completed, the player who has his markers on it uses its effect.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Arrange the Arena&#10;To each player, give 7 Copper Coin cards, 2 Water cards and 1 Landing card; these 10 cards form his starting deck. If there are less than 4 players in the game, put the remaining Copper Coin? and ?Water? cards back in the box.&#10;&#10;You do not use all cards or all island boards during one game. The cards you use are placed in the center of the table so that everyone can reach them; sort the cards according to their names and place them in separate face-up piles. The area with these card piles and the island board is called &quot;the Arena.&quot;&#10;&#10;All the Silver Coin, Gold Coin, Meat, Landing, and Exploration Action cards and the Medal Victory Point cards are used in any game. The number of Golden Medal cards that should be in a game is the number of players plus 2 (use 4 in a 2-player game, 5 in a 3-player game, etc.). Return the remaining Golden Medal cards to the box.&#10;&#10;Then, choose 8 of the other 16 types of Action cards and one side of any island board you like. Place the board with the chosen side up in the Arena, thereby making it your &quot;island.&quot; Place all the cards of the chosen types in separate face-up piles, and put all the resource chips beside your island. Finally, return the remaining types of cards and boards to the box.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#150;&#160; When the Game Ends&#10;The game ends if any of the following conditions exists at the end of a turn.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;Four of the card piles in the Arena have been exhausted (or 3 in a 2-player game).&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;There are no Golden Medal cards in the Arena.&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;Any player has 20 victory points or more from his VP chips.&#10;&#10;Once the game ends, all players calculate their victory points and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

It can also be played as a &ldquo;campaign game&rdquo; linked with another of 3W&rsquo;s Bonaparte series, The Battle of Eckmuhl (in S&amp;T #114). Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios are provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. An additional dozen scenarios can be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&amp;T #115 (Kanev). These later scenarios link the two games.&#10;&#10;Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #116 includes two more scenarios along with a Q&amp;A by the designer.&#10;&#10;Nominee for the 1987 Charles S.

    "Description": "The Book of Esther describes the harrowing tale of a young girl and the fate of the Jewish people. The villainous Haman has been put to death, but his murderous plan lives on through his ten sons. You are loyal messengers of the King and Queen, tasked with putting a stop to the hatred infecting the empire and securing peace for the children of Israel.&#10;&#10;Purim is a cooperative card-management and area-control game. You and your fellow messengers must work together to spread the King&rsquo;s proclamation, represented by gold cubes, to all the far-flung provinces of the empire.  At the same time Haman&rsquo;s ten sons are trying to orchestrate the destruction of the Jewish people by spreading their false messages, represented by black cubes.&#10;&#10;Every round each player will receive a set number of Action Cards that have a Loyal Action, an Evil Action, and an End Effect.  Players simultaneously select one Action Card from their hand and then reveal it.  The Action Cards are then processed based each card's number with the card's Loyal Action happening first before the Evil Action.  Loyal Actions will generally add gold cubes to the board, move Messengers, or remove Sons of Haman while Evil Actions will generally add black cubes or move the Calendar tile forward.  This process of selecting and playing Action Cards repeats until all but one card has been played in each player's hand.  When this occurs the last cards are revealed and the cards processed in numerical order with only the End Effect happening.  The round then ends and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The game end triggers when either the Calendar tile reaches the end of the Calendar, or players run out of gold or black cubes.  If each Province has gold cubes equal to or greater than the number of black cubes, the players win the game. If even one Province has more black cubes than gold cubes, the players have failed the King and lose the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

US and ARVN brigades/regiments and police battle VC battalions, NVA regiments, and subversive Political Cadres for Provincial control throughout the country.&#10;&#10;It is early 1965. The South Vietnamese government and army (ARVN) are collapsing in the face of growing Vietcong attacks. President Johnson feels he MUST act. On March 8, 1965, the 9th Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, lands at Danang to take over the large base&rsquo;s defense from ARVN forces who are presumably now free to conduct offensive operations against the VC. US Army units shortly deploy to Bien Hoa and other strategic areas. By fall 1965, the 1st Cavalry Division is engaged in a full-scale offensive in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam&rsquo;s Central Highlands. &quot;Americanization&rdquo; of the war has begun. Before it's over 10 years later, Cambodia and Laos are dragged into the struggle. US forces leave Vietnam in 1973 having never lost a sizable battle, but South Vietnam quickly falls nonetheless, in early 1975.&#10;&#10;Welcome back to 1965, now YOU are in command! The ARVN has basically collapsed and the North Vietnamese Army is infiltrating the south in large numbers even as local VC forces grow in strength. If you can hold Saigon until Summer 1977 (50 quarterly turns), the communists will be totally spent - Victory! Or will you, like Johnson and Nixon, find the VC and NVA impossible to completely defeat?&#10;&#10;",

They collect the gold listed on the card, then must pay the value listed on each pirate in their crew, making up any gold they lack from their own coffers. If they do this, they keep the card and increase their scoring.&#10;&#10;You can mutiny by placing a stack on another stack, then going after one of the four cards immediately, but you must then pay the mate and the rest of the crew double their pay.&#10;&#10;After all cards have been captured and the game ends, players receive additional gold based on the relative number of treasures they have captured.

The game also had special rules to allow you to play in various eras of baseball. These special era rules allowed you to see how players of the 70s may have fared when playing in the dead-ball era. One of the expansion sets you would even included a player card with your name on it when you ordered from the manufacturer.&#10;&#10;",

The other one is Die Ritter von der Haselnuss.&#10;&#10;Here the player is a badger (Dachs in German) in a forest. The forest has paths that lead to various amounts of meals for the badger. Once a badger reaches an area, he must roll the die a number of times equal to the amount of meals presented, and for each roll turn over the correct tiles. If the player turns over the correct tiles, the player gets to keep the meal tile, which will have a number of points on the downside (the more meals the higher points, usually).&#10;&#10;First player to the point goal wins the game.

The first sources of oil already have been found and all adventures head for Texas to find their fortune. However, the sources are limited. Who will find the right places to set up their oil rigs and produce the most oil?&#10;&#10;In the basic game players roll dice to determine a position on the game board where they can then place either one of their own drilling rigs or a neutral oil marker. In phase 2 players decide in which order the drilling rigs score points for adjacent oil markers (which are removed from the board after scoring). The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game will include at least two variants (and a second game board) to add more complexity. In addition, several fan rules will be published on the homepage www.schwarzesgold.com&#10;&#10;Schwarzes Gold is the winning title of the author's game competition 2008/2009 by www.spielmaterial.de. The task of the competition was to create a new game based on the game pieces of Giganten after those were bought in large quantities by www.spielmaterial.de (an online shop for game components).&#10;&#10;",

Soon merchants were sent to earth to trade their intergalactic goods. Their ships landed in the beautiful city of Vienna. During their stay, the city  was crowded with people who put their negotiation skills to a test.&#10;Do you have what it takes to outplay your opponents and trade with the Merchants of Qultah?&#10;&#10;During each round, you will encounter up to 8 extraterrestrial merchants, which can either be chosen or drawn randomly from a pool of 30 cards. These merchant cards build your game board for the first of two rounds.&#10;&#10;You will use your six dice, which represent your trading goods, to negotiate with the different merchants. The higher your result, the better is your argument. The players take their turns clockwise and once all players have used their dice, the round is over. Players reach their deals and collect their rewards. Sounds easy, right? HA-HA, there's always a catch!&#10;&#10;During your turn you try to manipulate your opponents dice, or your own, to either outplay them or get yourself in a better position. It is a constant battle of outbidding your negotiations. Then there are merchants who offer you different goods for different results, so you may have to go low to even get something in the end. But what if you are outbid before the round ends...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
