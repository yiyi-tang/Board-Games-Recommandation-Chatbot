    "Description": "From Wikipedia&#10;&#10;Hardtack was the first U.S. published American Civil War rules set and had an early following. However, by the end of the decade, it had been supplanted by Scott Bowden's Stars and Bars and John Hill's Johnny Reb 3 and is rarely played at modern wargaming conventions. However, it is considered as groundbreaking, and ushered an era of Civil War miniature wargaming in the USA.&#10;&#10;Introduction by Gary Gygax&#10;Painting Guide by Don Lowry&#10;&#10;Guidon Games Product # WM103&#10;&#10;Preface:&#10;&#10;This comprehensive set of rules is designed to take a person who has never played miniatures before thru several increasing stages of realism to the point where he can create for himself the kind of Civil War game which is most suited to his own personality.  When you have read and played everything this booklet contains, you will be prepared to design a Civil War game which has all the simplicity necessary for a great game.  The first version described is called the TRAINING GAME because it is designed to teach the basic mechanics of recreating Civil War battles with miniatures soldiers.  When it can be played without referring back to the rules, learn the more realistic BASIC GAME.&#10;&#10;",

There are cards in five colours, but players are only allowed to choose cards of three colours, so the influence on the cards played in the game by the other player might be limited. Also, several icons and numbers, plus some descriptive texts showing different values, powers and abilities of the cards.&#10;&#10;The rounds are &quot;days&quot;, in which in a strict order powers, friends, monsters and so on are placed onto the board. This has two personal zones - one for each player - and a neutral zone, in which the monsters are placed and attacked/captured in the main phase of each round. Aim of the game is to capture monsters with the total value of &quot;10&quot; through activating the power cards, but the other player can protect monsters with his/her cards, losing these powers for capturing doing so.&#10;&#10;After the &quot;attack / capture&quot; phase, there is a &quot;night phase&quot;, in which several monsters` activities are executed. Some more twists are interlaced in the system of the cards, influencing each other and offering some tactical decisions.&#10;&#10;In the starter set there are two decks with 30 cards each - the total of available cards is 111.&#10;&#10;Packed in a nice &quot;Bombo&quot; monster figure as storage for cards, player mats and rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

Words are identified by chaining along orthogonally adjacent sides of the letters.  As a result, the board can quickly come to look like quite a jumbled mess of letters with varied sizes, but this provides opportunities for lateral thinking in playing that next tile.  Each play initiates a Boggle-style word search, but with deference to the active player.&#10;&#10;Debuted in Essen 2008.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Ski Sprung Spiel (in English: Skijump Game) is trying to simulate a ski jump competition. After team selection each player will roll dice for selecting the highest position on the jump tower. Therefore all seven dice are rolled. After each roll at least one die has to be set aside face up. When all dice have been allocated the jumper is placed on the tower according to the rolled total result which is equivalent to a certain jump distance in meters. After all players are set up one player puts one of his jumpers for the jump. Then card play takes over. The effect of cards is to add or subtract jumping length from the a fore determined jumping length (the dice roll) or to move the jumper left and right on the hill simulating wind. Other players play cards for this jumper which are countered by the jumping player. This goes in turn i.e. player A plays card jumping player plays card, player B plays card jumping player plays card and so on until each non-jumping player had the chance to play a card. If the jumper is moved too much to the left or right or too long or too short of the board it is counted as a fall. Finally the jumping player plays a card for the landing again adding or subtracting metres. The final result will be noted down. The player which ski jumper has the farthest jump wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each set of tiles displays the head (plus name and birth and death dates), torso, and legs of the leader in question.  All three cards are marked with the same identifying number (1-16).  The game also comes with a 4-page biographical survey of the depicted leaders.&#10;&#10;For the under-6's, the game is simply one of putting the tiles together to form the leaders.  In the solitaire version, the child attempts to correctly construct all 16 figures. In the two-player version, children flip tiles one at a time by turn, trying to build the leaders.  The child with the most complete leaders wins.&#10;&#10;The game for 6-and-overs plays with a simple Go-Fish mechanic where 2-3 players take turns trying to reconstruct the famous leaders of French history by asking each other for specific body parts and pulling from the draw pile if they don't get them.  Again, the winner is the player who has reconstituted the most historical personages before the draw pile is gone and someone has run out of tiles.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, a player may take one of three actions:  lay a tile which expands the dungeon, move a monster in his force, or cast a magic spell.  The objective is to move your monsters into enemy Crypts.&#10;&#10;Monsters begin the game in their home Crypt.  Each has a strength and movement rating.  Strong monsters are slow, weak ones fast.  Which will you play early and which will you save for later?  Which will you use to defend, and which will seek entry into enemy Crypts?&#10;&#10;Dungeon tiles are used to build the dungeon.  Lay them carefully to block monsters from entering your Crypt, and make entryways into enemy Crypts.&#10;&#10;Spell tiles keep things interesting.  Poisons lower abilities; Potions raise them.  A Reaper could mean instant death, while a Seraph returns you safely to your Crypt.  Traps stop movement, while a Ghost lets you walk through walls.  Or use Transporters to pop up in unexpected places.  Suffering under an enemy spell? Remove it with a Zapper.&#10;&#10;Crypt is an easily-learned, quick-playing tile-laying game suitable for 2-4 players Ages 8 and up.  It is available as a self-published print-and-play game.&#10;&#10;",

Cause it's a strategic game, where you need to fight and conquer territory, by strangle your enemy in a prison of holes. Ok. Now here is the rule.&#10;&#10;As told above, the only things you need, is Pencil and Sheet grid, That's right, no eraser just that. Its a game which is simple to do, to play, and to explain. Just few rules to understand and you can play.&#10;&#10;What about the story ? Imagine that you are in a limited zone, with a chosen draw as player. You move and shoot each turn. When you move, you blacken your old player and place a new one at movement range. When you shoot, you blacken the place you shot from which is in Attack Range. A place which is Blackened cannot be passed through and is considered as an empty box. When the players ( all players ) aren't connected ( divided by empty boxes. ) The game ends, and the winner is the player with the most space. This game maybe looks  boring but it isn't!  Try it, its cost you nothing.&#10;&#10;A lot of variants can be made, from the mines to Multiplication Artifact and Invisible Shield. Same for the Mod, Capture Flag, Zombie mod, Team, Werewolf. Infinite possibilities.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, two monsters are chosen from a collection of monsters from the Godzilla universe.  During the game, the monsters randomly move around the board fighting each other, fighting military units, and destroying cities.  The players lose if the monsters cause too much destruction.  To prevent this, players need to move around the board investigating various locations to uncover a plot.  Once the players have done enough investigating, one of numerous plot cards is drawn.  The plot provides a win condition for the players but also makes the monsters more powerful.  The players must then race to meet the win condition before the monsters destroy Japan.  Aside from uncovering and resolving a plot, players may also build and mobilize military units to prevent the monsters from damaging the cities and buy valuable time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is an expansion and upgrade to the game &quot;Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century&quot; published by TSR in 1988 and requires a copy of that game in order to play.  If you have that game, just print out these components and you can play Buck Rogers 2.0.&#10;&#10;It is a game of conquest set in the inner solar system in the 25th century; the board features the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, along with the Asteroid belt.  Players build armies and space fleets and struggle to control these territories; whoever has the most territory at game end wins.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a character from the Buck Rogers universe, who grants the pieces around him or her special abilities.  These special powers will often dictate that player's strategy.&#10;&#10;Each game turn begins with each player bidding for turn order and then building new units.  They can build these units at factories, and can also buy mercenaries from the black market.  They can build ground units, which are vital for controlling planets, and spaceships which are necessary for traveling from one world to another.&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order each player moves his or her units; they may move as many or as few of their units as they like.  At the end of this phase, combat will occur if any player's units are in the same zone as another's, though combat can happen during movement if one player tries to move units through or out of a zone containing enemy units.&#10;&#10;In combat, units are moved to a &quot;battle board&quot; which allows the players to make tactical choices for their units.  The front section is the &quot;battle line&quot; where units may fire but are vulnerable to enemy fire, while the rear section is the &quot;reserve line,&quot; where units may not fire but are protected from enemy fire by units in the battle line.  Each unit has a set of numbers it needs to roll on a d10 in order to hit; which number it needs depends on the unit it is firing at.  Once only units from one faction remain the battle is over.&#10;&#10;Once all battles are complete, if no player has won the game the planets and asteroids all move forward one zone in orbit around the sun.  Since different planets complete orbits in different amounts of time, players need to watch for &quot;conjunctions&quot; where planets are close to one another and the opportunity exists for players to move from one planet to another quickly.&#10;&#10;Changes to the original game include:&#10;&#10;     Balanced Leader Abilities&#10;     9 new leaders - including 3 from the 1930's serial films &#10;     Turn order decided by bidding instead of randomly&#10;     Expanded Territory-Based Black Market Production &#10;     Use of the Cards During the Game (not just for setup)&#10;     Expanded Pass-through Fire Rules&#10;     The Tactical Battle Board for Combat&#10;     Offensive Gennie Variant (no more gennie turtling!)&#10;&#10;&#10;Upgrades:&#10;&#10;    Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The rules simulate nearly all details of a soccer game including ball possession and passing, throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks.&#10;&#10;The SuperFooty Classic Edition contains the cloth playing field, two complete teams (10 outfielders and 1 goalkeeper, each), two goals with nets, two balls, and instructions.  Figures are hand painted in the colors of Argentina, Brazil, England, or Italy.&#10;&#10;From the game insert:&#10;&#10;SuperFooty is a skillful and exciting table soccer game for two players.  Great technique, clever tactics and quick thinking make for the closest simulation of real soccer around!&#10;&#10;SuperFooty is for friends, for families, and for the most passionate there are National and World Championships for boys, girls, men, and women.&#10;&#10;Are you up to the challenge?&#10;&#10;",

A secondary goal was to make a dice game that is not completely multiple solitaire. The resulting game is played with 5 dice, hence the name, which is Japanese for '5 dice'.&#10;&#10;Every turn a player decides what 'development' he or she wants to roll for. These 'developments' change the nature of the game. Some allow re-rolling a die, others change how the dice-roll result is converted into a score or points. To achieve a certain development, at least a certain score has to be rolled. This required score increases with each development achieved. If a player rolls particularly high he/she can choose to take points rather than achieve the development he/she was rolling for. If there are no more developments available, the player must roll for points. The game ends when one player chooses to take points for the tenth time. The game takes about 10 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game was designed by Antonio Marcelo. It&acute;s a wargame about alternative World War II, with bloody battlefields, zombie soldiers, giant robots, hybrid human/gorilla soldiers, and so much !&#10;&#10;The core module comes with two maps, counters (for Russian and German army) and a rulebook. This game is a tribute to the old and classic Dwarfstar Microgames and Metagaming Games.&#10;&#10;A Little Part of History&#10;&#10;On the 16th of November of 1943, near the districts of Varena, a wood area in Lithuania, there was a fact that definitely changed the course of World War II. A small garrison from Wermacht taking care of that region lived idyllically, in spite of rumors about the defeat in Stalingrado and Kursk have been already heard by higher officers. Rumors about Russian victories and withdrawal of army were public. It was about 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning when the small garrison led by Sergeant Joseph Blummer was woke up by a loud hiss, followed by a large explosion. Everyone thought it was an artillery attack, or even worse, the Russians were invading the country. An alert was issued and 12 men armed themselves as they could and prepared to fight. After tense 30 minutes, only the silence was left, and a gleam from a burning wood was visible. The sergeant quickly got 5 men to follow him in a half track car to see what was happening. They went and were shocked to the spot and a surrealist scene: a vehicle in a shape of a disk, intact, but half buried in the ground due to the impact. The men immediately surrounded the place and sent a radio message to the garrison; they thought it was an experimental German aircraft, since the Fuhrer said new fantastic weapons would come from the Reich labs to the war effort.&#10;&#10;Less than 3 hours later, 4 Ju-52 landed carrying SS elite troops, with Himmler himself! The men were both frightened and amazed, because the discovery they made was very important. By 8 A.M., there were over 500 SS soldiers, who arrived by land, beginning to investigate the vehicle. By 11 A.M., Von Braum himself had arrived with his team and they prepared to move the strange vehicle. Joseph and his men were removed from the place, transferred to Berlin, where they were received honors; a distinction from Hitler himself was being promised. What the soldiers didn&rsquo;t know, however, is that Germany had received a gift that would change the course of war.&#10;&#10;Armies of the Game&#10;&#10;&#10;    Germans : Led by Adolf Hitler, spreads the terror worldwide. Using powerful weapons and bio-soldiers, they stand as the most feared army at war.&#10;    Soviets : Biggest enemies to the Germans in Europe. Leaded by Joseph Stalin , they are the arch-enemies of the Nazis.&#10;    Anglo-Americans : The gathering of armies by the U.S.A , England and all the others ally countries. A lot of bio soldiers and outstanding weaponry.&#10;    Nazi Mekas is originally a microgame for two players developed for the MDC III (Microgame Design Contest III), organized by Tom Higgins at Boardgamegeek Forum Boardgame Design.&#10;&#10;&#10;AN IMPORTANT NOTE!&#10;&#10;This game doesn&rsquo;t support Nazism, any other totalitarian political regime, or any human rights oppression. We want to remember that our goal is to show the new generations that war is one of the worst madness of mankind, and Nazism, above all, was an aberration and craziness from disturbed minds, who decided to finish the freedom and parity of men. A madman achieved the power in a big country in Europe and plunged the world in a nightmare for 5 years, resulting in the holocaust and onslaught of more than 50 million human lives.  We loathe this political regime and reject everything it has done to Jews, gypsies, citizens and millions of soldiers from many countries, including Germany itself, who lost their lives to end this nightmare.&#10;&#10;",

This is a sailing game where players decide on a course to run (St. Malo to Quebec, Lorient-Bermudas round trip, The Rum Route and others on the North Atlantic). Each player runs a boat and tries to be the first to finish the course. Winds will change from turn to turn, and players must adjust sail and attitude to the wind (i.e. course) according to the winds encountered. A unique mechanism is that players can master risks (incurred by carrying an inappropriate amount of sail in the prevailing wind conditions) by answering trivia questions about sailing. The questions come in 3 levels of difficulty; the correct answer allows to continue travel unharmed, a wrong incurs a penalty. Penalties can damage the boat, but each player has two repair cards to be used in case of emergency.&#10;The game board shows a map of the Atlantic Ocean from the equator to Newfoundland overlaid with a square grid. Certain currents and prevailing wind zones are marked and influence actual movement. Also on the map are obstacles in the form of completely blocked squares (ships, icebergs, large islands) and partly blocked squares (small islands).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ideograph is a party game about ideographic / pictographic association. Players create meanings for combinations of symbols (graphemes) based on associations of the (combined) meanings of those symbols. The player that comes up with the best / most creative / most humorous / most plausible explanation of the meaning of a combination of symbols wins that round. This is decided by means of voting. Hence, whether plausibility or humor is prioritized depends on the players and the situation.&#10;&#10;The game is based loosely on the structure of Chinese characters. The selection of symbols (card/graphemes) in the game is based partly on frequently occurring 'radicals' and other graphemes in Chinese characters, but also on Anna Wierzbicka&rsquo;s theory of semantic primes (natural semantic metalanguage).&#10;The shapes of the symbols are for the most part completely unrelated to those found in Chinese characters. Ideograph is not intended to be an educational game or to be helpful in learning Chinese characters. It is merely intended to be fun (within the right context), although playing with language in this way might be a rather geeky type of fun.&#10;&#10;",

Some of the characteristics of that era that are somehow worked into the design of the game are the hunger for wood that had to be brought in from farther and farther to the new capital; the struggles with the Emishi in the north-east; and the troubles of financing both.&#10;&#10;In the game, player build cities, parts of the capital Heian, and fight with the Emishi who occupy the north-east. Cities need wood to be built and that wood needs to be brought in from previously built cities. Cities also produce wood, and in some cases also metals. Forests can be cut to produce building timber only once, however. In fact, some areas that were known for their good timber before the Heian era, only produced firewood and charcoal at the end of the period. Hence, during the game, Japan slowly gets deforested and urbanized and resources are getting increasingly scarce. The player that managed to build and transport most efficiently and that built the most cities and the most (and best) buildings in the capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The traditional chess pieces are built up from these disks. A king needs 8, queen 7, bishop 5, knight 4, rook 3, pawn 1. If you move part of the disks from a piece, you change the piece to two weaker ones, or you can move disks onto a piece of your own and create one stronger piece. Pawns can only do this with their capturing move. There can be more than one of any pieces including king. A player can never be without a king. A king can be captured just like other pieces in normal chess as long as the player who just lost his last king can form a new one in his next move.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It was another fishing game, `Pike Attack' which was the the most promising new game on display at the &quot;Death Row&quot; at the London Toys Fair of 1994. &#10;The aim of Pike Attack is to collect and keep a full set of five fishing tackle cards, which are laid face up on the board. &#10;A full set of tackle allows a player to fish, with the object of landing the heaviest catch. If the player holds a bite card, then the player is able to take a fish card. If the player's tackle matches the ratings for both line and hook, as shown on the fish card, then the player lands the fish. &#10;However, if only one of the ratings match, the player must throw the `fight dice'. The throw determines whether the fish is caught, gets away, or whether a penalty is suffered, such as loosing your hook or breaking your line.&#10;&#10;Lurking amongst the normal fish is the Pike. If a player draws the pike card then it is possible to catch the pike if a Pike Buster card is held, otherwise you are likely to lose either part of your tackle or part of your previous catch.&#10;&#10;The game has been sponsored by Shimano, a fishing tackle company, but the inclusion of their logo in the computer generated graphics is very discrete and does not distract from the appearance.&#10;&#10;Very appealing game components make a good and light family game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Aseb is an ancient Egyptian game played on a board reminiscent of the Royal Game of Ur and Senet, to both of which it seems to be related. The exact rules are unknown.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a middle row with 12 squares and at one end two rows of four squares, one each on either side. Hence the game is sometimes called the Game of Twenty Squares.&#10;&#10;Note: It has often been misidentified as &quot;The Game of Thieves&quot; or &quot;The Game of Robbers&quot;.&#10;&#10;It may be a relative of Senet and The Royal Game of Ur.&#10;&#10;",

The book also included most of the new weapons that had been published in White Dwarf during the five years for Rogue Trader.&#10;&#10;One might argue that this book is REALLY Warhammer 40,000 second edition, but that would conflict with the system numbering that is widely accepted.&#10;&#10;The 96-page book has 18 pages of rules, 68 pages of weapon stats, 4 pages of catalog, and 8 pages of pull out charts.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Blood-and-Cardstock website:&#10;&#10;Evil Vendetta Pie Fight is a quick free for all game. In EVPF you're all evil magic-wielding nightmares from the human psyche and you hate each other's guts. Your union won't let you actually hurt each other, so the only way to settle this like, well not like men, is to have an&hellip;Evil Vendetta Pie Fight.&#10;&#10;Players each take a unique monster character (Witch, Mummy, Werepoodle, Vampire, etc.) and commence to throw magic pies and spells at eat other. If one of their six body regions is struck by a pie then it is immobilized and can not be used. There are spells to deflect pies, clear pies off body parts, and bend the rules. Last thing standing wins.&#10;&#10;In general, when a player begins to carry more pie than others, players will gang up on him/her to eliminate them from the game. In addition, as play progresses more and more of the defensive cards leave the game thus ensuring acceleration of pie hits and a certain and quick end to the game.&#10;&#10;Evil Vendetta Pie Fight is currently available in a Flagpole edition. What does that mean? Glad you asked. It means the game is made out of cardstock that I have printed out on my little HP Officejet and chopped up on a paper cutter by my very own hand. It comes in a plain white cardboard box BUT every game is numbered and autographed. There will only be 100 copies of the Flagpole edition. If they sell well we hope to have a production version out soon.&#10;&#10;The flagpole comes with:&#10;&#10;64 pie cards and 32 spell cards for a total of 96 cards &#10;36 cards to construct your being's bodies from. &#10;1 normal six-sided die &#10;42 bingo tokens which are used to target pies and spells&#10;&#10;You can play it right out of the box. Come on, you KNOW you want to throw pies at your friends&hellip;&#10;&#10;",
