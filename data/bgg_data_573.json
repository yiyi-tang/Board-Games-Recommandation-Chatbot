    "Description": "The Tactical Assault: Combat Cards&trade; is an elegant card-driven rule set for bringing all of the challenges of combined arms warfare - including command &amp; control and the fog of war - to the tabletop battlefield in a very playable fashion. The rules are even able to incorporate the some of the more problematic aspects of modern operations such as air support, artillery barrages, fortifications, smoke screens, engineering operations and so forth into the same fast-play, narrative based system.&#10;&#10;Despite being deceptively simple in appearance, the Combat Cards provide a very challenging game full of hard choices and long range planning. The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.&#10;&#10;In addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.&#10;&#10;And if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Combat Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles&trade; print-n-play packs. These sets give Combat Card players everything they need to play exciting battles in a hex and counter style format - including unique scenarios, beautiful full color maps and more than enough counters to allow players to develop their own scenarios. The only thing the players need to provide is their own Combat Card decks!&#10;&#10;All of this is offered in an easy to download print-n-play format available at the Tactical Assault Games website - along with articles on tactics, tips &amp; tricks, designer's notes and more!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Square chess (&#230;&#150;&#185;&#230;&#163;&#139; f&#196;&#129;ngq&iacute;), also known as &#228;&#184;&#162;&#230;&#150;&#185;(di&#197;&#171;f&#196;&#129;ng) and &#228;&#184;&#139;&#230;&#150;&#185;(xi&agrave;f&#196;&#129;ng), is an abstract strategy board game played traditionally in the northwestern regions of China, especially Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other areas with a high concentration of Chinese Muslims. The game is also played by Dungans, who have brought the game with them to Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 7x8 grid, with pieces played on the points, much as in Go. Players take turns alternately placing stones until the board has been filled up, attempting to form 2x2 squares with their pieces. When the board has been filled up, players each remove one of their opponent's stones. The player then counts up the squares that he/she has formed and removes an equal number of the opponent's pieces, as long as those pieces are not part of a square. After the initial removal of pieces, players take turns moving pieces; pieces can move any distance along the grid up, down, left, or right. Every time a square is formed, the player can remove one of the opponent's pieces(again, as long as this piece is not part of a square). The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces first is the winner. Thus, the game is similar in concept to Nine Men's Morris.&#10;&#10;The game can be played on any 7x8 board using black or white go stones, even on the intersections of a chessboard. The game is popular in agricultural communities in northwestern China, and often played on a board traced out on the ground.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The following description is mainly copied from the Wikipedia description for the game.&#10;&#10;Khanhoo is a non-partnership &quot;draw-and-discard&quot; card game which was adapted to Western taste by British diplomat William Henry Wilkinson and published by the London card maker Charles Goodall in 1891. The Chinese game from which Wilkinson got his inspiration was called Kanhu and seems to have been widespread in China in the second half of the nineteenth century.&#10;As it is a card game of the Rummy family, the object of the game is to get rid of all cards by melding them. The first player to do so is granted 5 points and the first to reach 50 wins the match, which can be achieved in two, three or four rounds of games.&#10;t was first brought to England prior to 1895 by Sir William Henry Wilkinson (1858-1930), a British Sinologist who served as British consul in China and Korea and who wrote many articles and books on Chinese games such as A Manual of Chinese Chess (1893), Chinese Origin Of Playing Cards (1895), The Game of Khanhoo (1895) and Bridge Maxims (1918).&#10;In 1891 Wilkinson induced the card maker Charles Goodall to issue a special pack of cards with accompanying booklet of rules to play Khanhoo. The deck contained two sets each of Ace through Nine of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds, with two specially-designed Jacks, Queens and Kings standing in for the &quot;extra cards&quot;.&#10;&#10;This entry is for the game promoted by Wilkinson and should be distinguished from the earlier Kanhu or Kwa Oh played with money-suited playing cards. The game should also be distinguished from allied games like Cuajo, which use Spanish-suited playing cards.&#10;&#10;",

It was the era of soldier-kings and enlightened monarchs, when powerful states maneuvered professional armies and fought to gain rich provinces. FW is primarily intended as a multi-player player game. It can be played by two, three or four, with each player representing a different major power: Prussia, Austria, France or Britain. Other states are represented as minor powers. Each player has a variety of military and diplomatic instruments with which he can attempt to make his mark on history.&#10;&#10;FW&rsquo;s system is based on our earlier-published 1066 and Hannibal&rsquo;s War games; however, there have been changes to the rules to reflect the differences in scale as well as the era being covered.&#10;&#10;The square-grid map shows Europe from London to East Prussia and south to the Balkans and central Italy. Off-map areas are handled using holding boxes. Each game turn represents one year. Each military unit represents 2,500 to 10,000 men. Each square represents 50 miles (81 km) across from side to opposite side. Designed by Joseph Miranda&#10;&#10;Rules cover such things as: the balance of power, negotiations, mobilization, fog of war, honors of war, fortresses, sieges, forced march, ambush, delaying actions, pillage, leaders, veteran and guard units, fleets, fieldworks, minor powers, declaring war, the Holy Roman Empire, prisoners of war and much more. The sequence of play is as follows.&#10;&#10;1) Balance of Power Phase&#10;2) Initiative Determination Phase&#10;3) Taxation Phase&#10;4) Market Phase&#10;5) Negotiation Phase&#10;6) Grand Diplomacy Phase&#10;7) Mobilization Phase&#10;8) Operations Phases&#10; a) First Operations Phase&#10; b) Second &amp; Subsequent Operations Phases&#10;9) Provisioning Phase&#10;10) Sudden Death Victory Check Phase&#10;11) End of Game Turn Phase&#10;&#10;",

The rusting progress is simulated on a rust-o-meter by 50 grommets and after each round one six sided die is rolled and that number is removed. If all are removed before the last barrel of waste is uncovered the players have lost.&#10;The gaming area is set up by mixing all brown cards face down including the five toxic cards and forming a 5x6 pattern. On these the yellow action cards are placed face down as well and finally all green landscape are placed on top face up. The game uses a currency of power beans of which each player gets one six sided dies worth each round. These are used to remove landscape cards 10 for a small card and 20 for a big card and players are allowed to pool power beans. If an action card is unearthed it is turned and the required action is read. This action then needs to be executed in order to remove the yellow card to gain access to the lowest layer of brown cards. Once the brown cards are accessible they may be turned without additional cost.&#10;&#10;",

BrainBox games will teach your children basic geography facts in a way that makes them eager to play; when have you ever been able to say that about flashcards?&#10;&#10;BrainBox games develop both short and long term memory by challenging children to recall what they saw. Players study a game card for 10 seconds trying to memorize a variety of features such as surrounding countries or states, flag colors, famous landmarks, historical figures, and so forth. A die is rolled and if the player can answer the corresponding question, the card is his. Play until one child has won a set amount of cards or play until all cards are acquired. With 55 cards and 10 questions per card, this is a painless way to learn 550 geography facts. Designed for readers, but pre-readers do not have to be left out; just adapt the questions to their level.&#10;&#10;Players with the most points win.&#10;&#10;",

Each horse is assigned a value, so stable owners must be careful not to drop a horse in class so much that the horse is snagged by another owner.  There are ten race programs that each dictate a different combination of Claiming, Stakes, Fast and Sloppy races.  Each horse has a card with a set of numbers for each quarter of the track. A spinner determines which number in the quarter's set is used for movement. The board has bonus spaces.  The cards have bonus moves for horses that are &quot;mudders&quot; when entered into races with a sloppy track.  The game winner is based on highest stable value added to cash in hand after the eighth and final race.  Advanced rules include betting options.&#10;&#10;The game was later released as a computer horse racing simulation with Daily Racing Form like past performances and other additional features under the same name.  The computer game is still available along with equestrian related stained glass, an odd combination of products.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;DICE Hockey features the use of individual player cards.  Players pass the puck around the ice using their own cards trying to work for a player shot or a goalie shot.  Players will pass, shoot, and defend just like they do on the ice.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own passing column on their individual player card. This makes for a fast action hockey game where you will get exciting possession after possession without referring to a chart.&#10;&#10;Penalties, Face offs, Injuries, turnovers, special plays, and more are all included.&#10;&#10;Lineup cards will keep track of your current lines and making line changes is so quick and easy you will barely realize you are making one.&#10;&#10;A timing chart will help you keep track of when the period ends and the time remaining.  You will also get score sheets and team reference sheets.&#10;&#10;DICE Hockey also features a full career mode.  Lace them up as a skater or a goalie and start working on becoming a legend on the ice.  You start out as a border line player and as you accomplish certain tasks in a game you can earn points.  Spend those points on card upgrades.  The better you perform the more points you earn.  You will get over 100 blank player cards in your game and more will be available for free whenever you need them.&#10;&#10;DICE Hockey is available as both a print and play E-game or you can purchase the actual hard copy board game version.  The print and play game comes with the 2007-2008 season and you will get the 2008-2009 season as soon as it ends and I have it available.  If you want the printed copy, you get to select which of the two seasons you want to come with your game and you will get the other season emailed to you as a PDF.  Or for just a little more you can get the game with both seasons printed and mailed to you.&#10;&#10;",
