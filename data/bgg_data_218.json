    "Description": "ZU Tiles: Hime is a strategic tile placement game based loosely on the creatures of the Chinese Zodiac. Players choose a creature (or creatures) to build customized decks around in order to out think and out play their opponent(s). Players earn points by creating patterns of &ldquo;compatible squares&rdquo; using creatures or by battling and capturing opposing creatures. The first player to 12 points wins! Think Collectable Card Game meets Dominoes...but with amazing anime inspired art and super fun tile interactions.&#10;&#10;ZU Tiles: Hime is a quick and easy game for the whole family, focusing more on its unique compatibility mechanics than it does on combat. We're hoping you have more fun and more genuine enjoyment of playing vs. the sometimes cutthroat competition that other more competitive deck building games can become. Relax. Take your time. Smile more. Laugh a bit. Enjoy yourself.&#10;&#10;Starter Set 1 consists of the Pig, Rabbit, Ram, Tiger, Horse, and Dog tiles.&#10;Starter Set 2 consists of the Dragon, Snake, Rooster, Rat, Ox, and Monkey tiles.&#10;&#10;AWARDS AND HONORS&#10;2020 Board Game Spotlight Top Game of 2020 Silver Spotlight Award&#10;Top 5 Game of 2020: Minimum Player Count&#10;&#10;",

The basis of the game is simple but highly effective: 42 Animal cards (21 pairs) and 4 Hunter cards are dealt out among the players. Each player then takes his cards into his hand without showing them to anyone else. Each player chooses a card and plays it face-down in front of himself. He then tries to mimic the cry of the animal on the card he has chosen, with the objective of finding its mate.&#10;&#10;As soon as two players think they share the same animal, the both knock the center of the table. This action suspends the game while the players check to see if they were correct. If they were, they are awarded their respective cards.&#10;&#10;At any time, a player who can't find his mate may take his card back into his hand and play out another, henceforth imitating the cry of the new card's animal instead.&#10;&#10;Players have to watch out for the Hunters, which let one imitate an animal's call...&#10;&#10;A game of hilarious cacophony for players 7 and up and which has an impressive variant intended for 42 players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is an old Parker Brothers card game with a Scout theme. The deck contains 5 Patrols (suits) of 10 cards each with the cards numbered from 1 to 10. The 1 card is called the Patrol Leader. The player to the dealer's left starts by playing any card between 1 and 10 from his hand to the center of the table. The next player must either play a card from the same Patrol whose number is 1 greater or 1 less than the card on the table, or play a card from a different Patrol whose number is the same. For example, if an Owl 4 card is led, the next player may play an Owl 3 below it, an Owl 5 above it, or a 4 card from a different patrol (say a Wolf 4) adjacent to it (thus allowing Wolf cards to be played). The lead card designates the number that all other patrols must start on (in this example number 4). If a player has no legal play he must pass. The first player to play his last card scores points equal to the numbers on all the cards still in the other players hands. A Patrol Leader card counts as 15 points for scoring. The first player to score 250 points wins.&#10;&#10;According to the Dutch rules from publisher Goliath Games, the number of Patrols used in a game is equal to the number of players (e.g. only use 3 Patrols in a three player game).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Guests arrive at a mansion for what they hope will be a relaxing weekend, but alas the calm of Friday night is broken when a cry of fright rings out. The guests wake up and gather only to be horrified with the discovery of the lifeless body of one of them. Who could have killed him? And more importantly, who will be the next victim?&#10;&#10;Fatal Rendez Vous plays a bit like Werewolf, with most players belonging to one group while one or more of them secretly work against the group. Each player receives a role card at the start of play. Each night in the game, while everyone has their eyes closed, one of the secret assassins taps another player on the shoulder; this player counts to ten, then dies. Day comes, and everyone runs around in a tizzy &mdash; specifically turning in circles three times &mdash; during which time the other assassin winks at someone, killing that person as well.&#10;&#10;The guests handcuff two players during the day, and those two players take no actions for the next day. This pattern continues until three days pass. If the assassins have been handcuffed together during the weekend, then the other guests win, having captured the evildoers; if not, however, the assassins claim the victory.&#10;&#10;Fatal Rendez Vous includes special role cards that mix up play, for example, with a player who becomes a vampire after death, taking out the assassin and murdering people on his own. Another player might have a weak heart and perish after only five seconds, giving the assassin less time to find cover.&#10;&#10;&#10;From TricTrac:&#10;&#10;Le D&eacute;fifoo Noir (subtitled Friday the 13th at the Castle) is a game inspired by Cluedo and Agatha Christie&rsquo;s 12 Little Indians and is another game in the lineage of Werewolf. It is designed by Olivier Finet, principal designer at D&eacute;fifoo SA. The game can accommodate 5 to 20 players and play time is estimated at 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players are given a special role representing either an innocent guest at the castle or a sinister murderer. The players are invited to investigate the murders and hopefully throw the right suspect(s) in prison. In this game however, people are free to move around during the day phases and interact freely with one another, thereby using all of their senses to nab their victims/assailants. These negotiation phases however are timed and last only 3 minutes. Making things harder on the poor guests, the murders happen both at night and during the day over a maximum of 5 turns. The game components include the role cards, a pair of handcuffs (for the culprits), a timer and a bowtie for the Castle&rsquo;s host (game overseer).&#10;&#10;",

This ignorant person has two stacks of item cards in front of them and starts the round by picking one of the two top items, showing it to the first player in clockwise order, and asking whether they will need the item for the mission. The other player may answer only &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but can stress the words in any way they like.&#10;&#10;Then the ignorant person picks another item and shows it to the next player, and so on. When the ignorant person has collected four &quot;yes&quot; cards, they have to guess what their mission is.

If the players can tell a good story about how to use the item, they get an extra point.&#10;&#10;All &quot;no&quot; cards go as points to MacGivrette. If an ignorant person guesses the wrong mission, MacGivrette also gets the mission cards as a bonus (and the number of mission cards goes down by one). If any player answers anything else other than &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, MacGivrette gets that item card as well.&#10;&#10;When the group has solved a round with five mission cards, the game ends and they count their cards. If they have gathered more cards than MacGivrette, they win!&#10;&#10;",

The French player must consolidate her polyglot army and its inspiring leader, while dealing with Joan's &quot;voices&quot; via an events table that leaves him feeling slightly out of control.  The English player has to deal with Scots and herrings and trying to resist the &quot;help&quot; of an unwanted Burgundian ally.  Both players face the challenges of making siege and open-field combat work for them, in an era where artillery and charges by armored knights belong on the same battlefield. The game includes 200 counters, a full-color, mounted mapboard, and all the charts you will need to keep your focus on the Maid.&#10;&#10;Joan of Arc's Victory also includes a random &quot;Joan Events&quot; table that will render the French player a sense of the uncertainty being around someone divinely inspired might provide. And it keeps life interesting for the English too, as Joan may do something very unexpected (and have surprising combat benefits too!).&#10;&#10;No two games will ever be alike.&#10;&#10;Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series&#10;That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

With the help of their special equipment, they will compete with each other to gather the most treasure from this expedition &ndash; but watch out for The Guardian! He awakes from the darkness of the ruins to fulfill his mission, to chase all intruders and throw them out with a curse!&#10;&#10;In Pyramid Raiders, players lay down action tiles to move and collect treasure tokens on a hexagonal map. Besides providing a number for movement, action tiles will also effect The Guardian in different ways, such as rotate him to face another direction or make him move faster. Used action tiles will stay on board, and will be returned to hand only every five turns when they are all used.&#10;&#10;The Guardian's movement is guided by a set of rules and does not need a player to act as the GM. Each turn after all players have finished their moves, roll a die to move The Guardian, then move it extra spaces depending on the action tiles played this turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of each game, randomly place 49 treasure tokens of seven kinds on the map. Players score by collecting tokens of different colors, or by specializing in only one or two colors. Twelve wooden tokens are placed on the map as obstacles, and can be placed in different layouts to change the difficulty of the game. Ten item tiles are included to provide rule-bending effects for players. And for those who are up for the challenge, two extra Line of Sight tokens will let The Guardian literally grow eyes on his back, making it even harder to escape &ndash; or easier to trap other players depending on your point of view...&#10;&#10;",

Depending on whether the majority of Dissidents have successfully coordinated at a single location, or the Mods have caught them in an attempt at subversion will determine whether that location becomes 'hacked' or 'moderated'.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, moderated locations produce potential accomplices for the Dissidents to recruit, as undesirables are driven from now sanitized districts. However, as the Dissidents progress their mission to 'hack' as many locations as possible, the Moderators strike back with increasing numbers of surveillance outposts, installed to limit the Dissident's ability to move around the city undetected.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In IncrediBrawl, each player guides a colorful cast of characters from all corners of the imagination as they meet in an epic clash for glory! Summon the right characters at the right time to outwit your opponents; use whatever strategy you can muster to overcome the randomness of the brawl! Amass the most glory along the way to become the ultimate champion in this crazy contest of luck and wits!&#10;&#10;For basic gameplay, players shuffle their deck and draw five cards to start the game. Each player simultaneously selects a character from his hand and plays them face down at the current location. Once all the players have selected their characters, flip over the cards to begin the brawl!&#10;&#10;After triggering any abilities revealed by the flip, players then compare their power type and power levels to determine who wins each scrap and the overall brawl. The winner gains one Glory (VP), plus activates any abilities their character may have that trigger off of winning. Each player then discards the played character, and draw one new card before the next round begins. The first player to reach ten Glory wins the game!&#10;&#10;Each card in IncrediBrawl has a unique ability, and each player will start the game with a copy of the same set of cards. Choosing which character to play and what ability to trigger at just the right time is key to collecting the most Glory and winning the game!&#10;&#10;",

They also receive a colored ball they have to store in the middle of the table. Each turn a player shows the top card of the draw deck to the other players.

Because citizens look the same as the other players (but they don't carry a gun) it is easy to shoot a citizen by mistake. You also should be alert for the police. You don't want to shoot when a police card is turned. A few other special cards add some extra surprises to the game.&#10;&#10;(Street Paintball was released at Spiel 2008)&#10;&#10;",

The game has a simple but refined mechanism able to represent the 24 seconds action in 3 shot-clock turns. Players move on the court, mark, dribble, block, pass, score for 2 or 3 points as in the real and amazing NBA matches! Time is running, the opponents are 2 points short and have the ball; a few seconds to the end, the public is shouting: &quot;defense-defense&quot; it is not only a game, it is really happening! GAME FOR FANS AND PEOPLE INTERESTED IN KNOWING A BIT MORE ON BASKETBALL.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY: the miniatures are moved accordingly to the result of a red 6-sided die (for the ball's owner) and a green 6-sided die (for the remaining 4 miniatures). After any unit movement the defending team can reply with a unit movement trying to mark. All the miniatures have values of speed and passing capabilities, and also 2-points and 3-points percentages values. Therefore players can manage the game as a real NBA game, trying to have the best player in the best shooting position for scoring. When a miniatures decides to shoot a 12-sided die is rolled and the result is eventually diminished by one if the miniature is marked. If the result is equal or lower than the miniature's shooting ability then there is a score.&#10;Situations like blocks, dunks, stealing the ball, illegal defenses, screening, free throws and faults add to the game a high likelihood. Special cards for special actions are present.&#10;&#10;",

The game begins with the American invasion of that island and includes the subsequent Japanese attempts to retake it. The game is intended to be a simulation of combined air-naval-ground operations, or what are today called &quot;joint operations&quot;.

    "Description": "MTV, The Throwback Music Party Game, based on the iconic network, is for music lovers of the 80s, 90s and beyond (but don&rsquo;t worry, as long as you&rsquo;ve heard of a few artists from these years you&rsquo;ll be fine!). Open the throwback boombox, flip open the cassette player gameboard, and split into two teams.&#10;&#10;First, go head-to-head in the Quick-Fire Buzzer Round. One player from each team tries to think of a song to fit the description on the Head-to-Head category card (e.g. &ldquo;Pop Anthems&rdquo;) before the 15-second timer runs out, hitting the buzzer to throw the mic back to their opponent. The first person to run out of time loses this round.&#10;&#10;In the Artist Round, get ready to belt it out! Each player gets three Artist Cards and has 30 seconds to get their team to guess all the artists using one of three methods&mdash; using just one word; speaking the lyrics; or performing one of the artist&rsquo;s songs. When a team gets one right, they add the card to their collection. The first team to grab a card from all eight categories wins and has the right to party like it&rsquo;s 1999!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is your responsibility to determine when &mdash; and how &mdash; to act in order to capitalize on a potentially beneficial marketplace. If your mine is not built wisely and safely, a share of your company's profits will be lost after the end-of-year visit from the mine inspector.

The game depicts sixteen famous battles from the introduction of the bayonet to the invention of rifling. Because of the tactical scale of Grenadier some of the battles are represented by crucial segments, isolated and simulated. For example the Battle of Waterloo (1815) is represented by the attack of Napoleon's Old Guard on the center of the British line, The Battle of the Pyramids (1798) by the attack of the Marmeluke cavalry on the most exposed French infantry. Several other battles such as Palo Alto (1846) from the Mexican War are covered entirely. Commanders represented include Marlborough, Frederick the Great, Napoleon, Ney, Wellington, and Zachary Taylor. Some of the 16 battles depicted in Grenadier are Blenheim, Austerlitz, Marengo and Jena. Attacks are divided into fire (musket and cannon) and shock (bayonet and saber) modes. There are nine types of infantry units, three cavalry and five artillery. Grenadiers combat resolution systems depends less on chance (die rolls) than any game then yet developed.&#10;&#10;",

Throughout November the Confederate commander, Braxton Bragg, had misinterpreted that pursuit as an effort to capture Chattanooga; so now he halted and deployed his troops northwest of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, so as to safeguard the road junction there. Thus the Confederates sat and awaited their pursuers for a month. When the Federal army arrived in late December 1862, the Confederates launched a surprise attack near Stones River.&#10;&#10;Stones River utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which presents a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the Civil War while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure a line of retreat.&#10;&#10;In Stones River a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of the rifled musket. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.&#10;&#10;",

You must roll all 3 dice and be left with only the result of 2 dice (the other discards it).&#10;You must add them and with that result you can take an action.&#10;&#10;With the value of the sum of 2 dice you have 3 options:&#10;&#10;- Draw a token from your reserve and place it in the first position on the card of that value.&#10;- Advance a token already placed on a card of that value.&#10;- Remove one of his tokens from one of the cards he previously placed and relocate it to position 1 of the card of that value.&#10;&#10;HOW TO DRAW A LETTER:&#10;When a player reaches the final position of a card, he takes it for himself. He places it in front of him turned and leaves the used token on it being unused. He will play with one less chip.&#10;If other players 'tokens are found on the card to be lifted, they return to their owners' reserve.&#10;&#10;GAME OVER:&#10;The first player to get 3 cards in their possession wins the game.&#10;&#10;ADVANCED VERSION&#10;It is played the same as the base game but the 4 effect cards are mixed, the first 2 are taken and placed on the table. The remaining 2 are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;These letters have actions. Some are executed immediately and others on the next turn of whoever chose it. A player achieves an effect when one of his pieces is placed in the middle position of a card with its numerical value in white.&#10;&#10;At that time you can select one of the 2 visible effects. Then that card must turn it over and the effect of its reverse will be the one that can be chosen in the future.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

In this chaotic universe, each player is a young star trying to control the galaxy where they live, and prevent the other players from seizing power. Why on earth would you dream of controlling the chaos and fighting against other stars? Well, to become the brightest and the most powerful star of the galaxy! Do not miss your chance, show the other stars how badass you are!&#10;&#10;Playing the Game: To start playing Entropia, deal three cards to each player and place the deck on the centre. One of the players goes first and the game starts. During your turn, you can choose and perform only one action, which can consist in drawing a card from the deck or playing one of your cards, then the turn passes to the next player in rotation.&#10;&#10;All cards in the deck stand for a planet and you can use them to perform different actions: for example, you can use your card to attract planets with your gravity by putting the card on the board in front of you (using the keyword Attract), you can convert the mass of a planet into pure energy (using the keyword Fuse) in order to draw new cards from the deck, play an extra card during your turn or scupper the strategies of the other players by destroying their planets. Moreover, you can also discard your cards when your planets have the same mass of your adversary&rsquo;s planets (using the keyword Annihilate) in order to stop other players heading all the way to the winning.&#10;&#10;Since the first person to control four planets wins the game, every player should develop unique strategies to destroy other players&rsquo; cards and conquer the four planets as fast as she/he can. Even though the game looks simple and easy to play at first glance, you will need to devise strategies to control overpowered cards and use them wisely. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you want to greedily take over all the four planets or slowly destroy your enemies&rsquo; resources: there are more methods and strategies you can use to win over the other players, so come and discover them while playing. You need to sharpen your weapons and grit your teeth to be the next champion of Entropia!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Most important among the new colonies was Titan; the largest moon of Saturn, beneath whose barren surface lay the salvation of civilization - fissionable materials sufficient to feed Earth's hungry reactors. Cooperation marked the early efforts of the two colonizing powers, but by 2117 - twelve years after the first fissionable strike - economic and territorial disputes precipitated war. Titan Strike! Simulates the struggle between the EEC and the HEA in deep space and on Titan itself. Futuristic infantry teams on hover platforms, Titan environmental Combat Vehicles, drone robot tanks, and jet-powered hoppers clash in an all-out effort to secure Titan's ultimate treasure - energy sufficient to sustain Earth's crowded billions for a century&#10;&#10;",

You arrange a man on each target, and then place the rest on various grey dots on your base.&#10;&#10;You each have mechanisms to shoot little balls..catapults and crossbows and the like. You take turns shooting 2-6 balls (depending on the die roll) at each other's targets. You continue to take turns until you wipe out all of your enemy's targets.&#10;&#10;You can spend some of your shots to move a soldier towards your opponent on these circles. You are allowed to place your shooting device closer to your opponent's base at this time...moving it up to be level with the advancing soldier. However, advancing soldiers are quickly targeted.&#10;&#10;In play, the easy shots (soldiers and simple targets) get knocked out in the first few rounds.

The first player who can tell which ingredient is missing scores a point. &#10;When the players are familiar with the system, various difficulty levels can be added by rolling more than one die:&#10;&#10;- One die to determine the movement direction&#10;- One die to determine whether the witch looks in the cauldron ahead or the one behind&#10;- One die to determine whether the witch is used or the fox - who always does the opposite of what the dice say (including finding out which ingredient is used twice instead of missing)&#10;&#10;The more dice are in play, the trickier it is.

You can also win by collecting 3 Buddha Llamas, but this can be reduced to 2 with the right combination of cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay involves tactical scheming through the use of various card types: Action, Magic, and Collectibles, and drawing a card from the deck ends your go.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s essentially the luck of the draw, but you must devise strategies, use your wit, and play combinations of cards to battle against other players, in an attempt to force them to remove their valuable cards and lose the round.&#10;&#10;There are other dangers lurking within the deck too, as drawing certain cards can mean instant death. However, there are ways to deflect this and Llamasters offers its players several routes back towards victory even when you&rsquo;re on the brink of giving up.&#10;&#10;One of the unique points of the game is the use of augmented reality, which if used, can allow players to re-enter a round they have already been knocked out of. The augmented reality app also includes enchanting animations to complement the gameplay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Centuries ago a desert land existed in the world of the Eternal Kingdom. The land was rich from its many trade routes and populated by a nation called the People of the Book. Wise rulers had always reigned over them, and thanks to this everyone lived in prosperity. Even so, some had rebelled against the binding order, ignoring the venerable customs and breaking the law...&#10;&#10;You are one of those renegades and &quot;enemies of the kingdom&quot;, but you now have a second chance for freedom as this land's ruler prophesized that among you there is a chosen one who in the future will affect the fate of the desert lands. He decided that a trial in an ancient labyrinth would resolve who would be released and who would see daylight no more. The corridors of the labyrinth are winding and bristle with cleverly planned and dangerous pitfalls. Tales and legends also mention a guard, an immortal Golem that tramps the stone corridors.&#10;&#10;Labyrinth: The Paths of Destiny 2 ed. is an adventure board game for 2-6 players who impersonate both the great constructors of the ancient labyrinth and the daredevils who try to escape.&#10;&#10;To find a way out of the labyrinth, each player must find a special key while avoiding traps from other players, not to mention the Golem. With their two actions each turn, players can construct the multi-level labyrinth, set traps, move, rest, attack other players and much more.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An LPS bonus mini-game for two-players, Desert Duel, by designer Mike Rinella, looks at the first battle of Alamein in 1942, where modern armies fought each other and the desert, in a desperate effort to breakthrough to or defend the path to the Nile.  This is not the Monty vs. Rommel El Alamein battle most people think of but an earlier action, July 1 to July 27, 1942. Each turn represents three days of combat, and each hex is about four miles across.&#10;&#10;Where 2nd El Alamein reminded many of WW1 type conflict, this first battle was pure open desert warfare, of the guy that both sides were developing on the fly, and Rinella&rsquo;s design captures the feel of the grit and gloom.&#10;&#10;Low density counter mix, ratio combat results table, supply, leaders, weather, air support, recon screening units, minefields and a special 88 Flak unit make for an interesting mix of mechanics.&#10;&#10;Desert Duel comes with 88 large 5/8&quot; mounted die-cut counters, and an integrated 17&quot; x 22&quot; full color map with rules and charts.&#10;&#10;This game was included as a bonus game for subscribers with Against the Odds (ATO) magazine #21 (the Kadesh issue).&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to score the most points by creating clever, funny and fitting band names.&#10;&#10;The game is played with each player being dealt a number of &quot;Word&quot; cards, each card contains four different words that can be used to construct a band name. Players may use as many words as they wish when creating their band names.&#10;&#10;The first player announces a preset goal. For example, &quot;Heavy Metal or Hip-Hop&quot;, &quot;Perverted&quot;, &quot;Food and Drink&quot;, &quot;Offensive&quot;, etc.&#10;&#10;All players then create a band name they feel best fits the current theme. For example, if the theme was &quot;Science Fiction&quot; you may players play band names like &quot;Robot Death Weasel&quot;, &quot;Oprah's Black Hole&quot;, &quot;Martian Ghetto Punks&quot;, or &quot;Hairy Alien Concubines&quot;. The game is designed to create as much hilarity as possible, but may be offensive to some depending on the word combinations chosen.&#10;&#10;Players then vote on who they feel generated the most fitting band name. This player wins the Theme List and one point.&#10;&#10;Players then draw new cards for the next round.&#10;&#10;Play continues for 10 rounds, the player who has the most points at the end of the last round is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The last place player also controls the &quot;rogue&quot; bumper car, Jimmy Fudge -- who only wants to bump other players.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one bumper car. Simultaneous movement card play determines the movement order. Players score points for moving around the track in the appropriate direction, and for bumping other bumper cars. Draws are done from a face up draft of n+1 cards where n is the number of players. The remaining card is used to control Jimmy Fudge's bumper car. Play continues until someone has scored 21 points, thereafter, there is an increasing chance of the game ending every turn.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;It's a beautiful day at the amusement park. You and your friends have decided to take over the bumper car ride for your own purposes. Players score points for bumping other players cars and going around the track in the proper direction. (Going backwards makes the carnies angry.) And who is this Jimmy Fudge kid anyway?&#10;&#10;",

You manage to escape the sinking vessel on a trusty inflatable flamingo and reach the shore, self-assured that you&rsquo;ve survived a shipwreck and shark-infested waters - only to be bludgeoned by a falling coconut.&#10;&#10;What are the chances?! Well it turns out, there are an average of 150 deaths by coconut per year. You regain consciousness to the realisation the shipwreck has turned your heavenly cruise to Eternal Paradise into a hellish race across Purgatory Island.&#10;&#10;From Coconut Beach, you&rsquo;ve gotta move by backing your betting ability in deciding which of the three options is most deadly. For example: Falling Coconuts, Lightning Strike or Extreme Selfies&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll be betting by using the only currency to hand: coconuts (ironically). You&rsquo;ve got a one-in-three chance of getting the answer correct. Which is roughly the same odds as being struck by lightning&hellip; if you play golf in a thunderstorm&hellip; dressed like a medieval jouster.&#10;&#10;Bet small and move cautiously.
