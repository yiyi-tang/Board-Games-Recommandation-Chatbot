    "Description": "Elementals are elemental beings developing from earth, fire, water or air and change perpetually. Players try to find elementals corresponding in two parts to an elemental in the middle. &#10;The cards are evenly distributed among the players. The first player turns up a card for the middle, this is the pattern. Then in turn players turn up their top card. If it does not correspond, it stays discarded with the player, if it corresponds, the player noting this claps his hand on the card in the middle. If the player is correct, he/she gets all open cards, if the player makes a mistake he/she loses the cards. Their are some special cards which have curious consequences.If a player has not enough cards for play of for paying for a mistake, the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;This game was released for Essen 2005.&#10;&#10;",

All players keep the cards in their hands and pass one card to the player on their right until one of the players has 5 identical cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;Each player takes one card from his hand and places it face down on the table in front of the player to his right. As soon as all players have put down a card, each player picks up the card passed to him from the player on his left (a command e.g. &quot;now&quot; may also be given for this). This procedure is repeated until one of the players has 5 identical cards in his hand. When this happens, the player in question puts his hand down on the table and calls &quot;Dingo&quot;. As soon as the other players hear the word &quot;Dingo&quot;, they must put their hands on top of the calling player&acute;s hand as quickly as possible. The last player to put his hand down must give one of his chips to the winner (the hand at the bottom).&#10;&#10;The game continues until the conditions agreed at the beginning of the game are fulfilled, or the player with the highest number of chips is the overall winner.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you must move your King (as a normal chess king) and then place a pyramid on the board. Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.&#10;&#10;Oddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a &copy; symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover. Even the rules for the game are printed on the back of the box (in English &amp; German) as opposed to being included on a separate sheet inside.&#10;&#10;",

If it's a number card, she must also draw that many cards.&#10;     The +2 card forces the next player to draw two cards and skip her turn &ndash; unless she also plays a +2 in which case the next player must draw four cards, etc.&#10;     A skip card skips the next player.&#10;     A stop card, which is numbered 0, can prevent the action of an exchange, +X, +2 or skip card played by the previous player.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the other players score points based on the cards they still have in hand. After multiple rounds, the game ends if a player has 500 or more points; the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The ninjas succeed by the clever use of special dice, exciting action cards, and real ninja stars. Fight in the dojo and defeat the opposing warriors with ninja dice! A mix of strategy, action and luck decides which ninjas will claim victory in the end!&#10;&#10;This game is reminiscent of Stratego. The game is played on a 5x8 board. Each player has fifteen ninjas: nine 1-star ninjas, five 2-star ninjas, and one Soke.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player places his ninjas on the three rows on his side of the board, in any formation he likes. The type of ninja (Soke, 2-star or 1-star) is hidden from the opponent.&#10;Each turn, a player has zero to three moves; the exact amount is determined at random, using so-called weapon cards. He can use these moves to move one or more ninjas. If he moves a ninja into a square occupied by an opponent, a battle ensues. Each player rolls a die for his ninja. Higher level ninjas roll better dice: a 1-star ninja rolls a six-sided die, a 2-star ninja rolls an eight-sided die and a Soke rolls a twelve sided die. The ninja whose owner rolls the highest defeats the opposing ninja, which is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The players can further influence the game by means of five action cards, which give special bonuses, and ninja stars, which allow a player to reroll his combat die.&#10;&#10;",

A few of them are flip-a-tiles, with each tile set having movement from 1-5 on them. Health has a bicycle theme, with one wheel being the tiles and the other wheel being the discard pile. Self Improvement tiles were books in a bookcase.&#10;&#10;The Love path has an arrow-through-a-heart spinner, with the arrow pointing to your movement, 1-4. Two other paths also have themed spinners.&#10;&#10;But the coolest of them was the Friendship path. The Hand of Friendship is a seesaw hand with a little marble in the &quot;wrist&quot; and when you seesaw it, the marble &quot;pachinko's&quot; into one of the five fingers, each having a different movement number 1-5.&#10;&#10;When you finish a path - and they have text on some of the squares (&quot;start over&quot; &quot;get a hang-up&quot; &quot;move forward&quot; etc.) - you click back in to the spinner and hope you land on the next path you need.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seas of Fortune is a family game about ships racing around Northern Europe, trying to find the best deals. The players are merchants overseeing each journey their ship makes. They try to guide their ships to the most advantageous cities, and find the best crews to sail them. Each successful unloading of goods in a city earns the player silver, and the game ends on the round someone reaches 100 silver marks.&#10;&#10;The game is set in 16th century Europe, and revolves around choosing the best routes for your ship, finding the best crews to get there the fastest, and planning for the future. Loading Cards are revealed to show what products are available in which cities, and Unloading Cards show which cities are buying what products. A further future card of both kinds is also revealed, to show the players what's coming. Old cards go out at the end of a round, and new ones come in instead.&#10;&#10;Each round all players choose a new crew for their ship. The first player token rotates over the rounds, and the last player is stuck with the only crew that is left. Each card shows a movement number, and an expertise either in coastal sailing or open sea. However, the choice of crew is not always obvious; the lowest movement number will move first, and the highest moves last. Any ties are solved with the first player token. During a turn, a player can freely move their ship between ports, load it for a fee and unload it for a reward. The faster a ship reaches a port for unloading, the greater the profit will be. The player with the most money when the game ends, wins!&#10;&#10;",

Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled.

That&rsquo;s the pirate way!&#10;&#10;Captains Wager is a betting and hand management game which combines classic elements of poker with the kind of clever card play gamers expect from more modern card games.  It accommodates 2-5 players and plays for about 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;In each round of the game players receive a hand of 4 crew cards (with values from 1-20) which they play in an attempt to win encounters by committing the highest valued card.  The crew cards also have effects which give players the opportunity to take actions in addition to providing their value towards winning the encounter.  Players who judge their hands to be strong based on their values and/or abilities can bet on them in order to increase the reward for winning.  For players unsure of their hand, but who still want to play the abilities of their crew, they can take a loan token worth minus 2 and still stay in the hand.  Players who have less confidence in their crews may fold to avoid risking their own precious gold.&#10;&#10;By winning encounters players may claim treasures and items which give them special abilities and the gold necessary to win the game.  The airship pirate who has claimed the most gold at the end of the game receives the title of Pirate Admiral and declares victory over the competition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We Are Dead: Zombie Mall Massacre! The board game where you and your friends take on the role of the shambling zombie horde. Your goal is simple: turn as many mall shoppers as you can into zombies. Achieving your goal is not simple. Human Heroes attempt to put you down permanently and the roaming horde of your victims is trying to eat up your food supply.&#10;&#10;We Are Dead is for 2-5 people ages 13+ and plays in about an hour.&#10;&#10;Art for the game was done by two amazing artists, Mike Morris and Mike Collins. I cannot rave enough about how well they brought the vision for this game to life (or unlife).&#10;&#10;Players take turns attempting to attack the mall shoppers trying to satisfy their recently unlocked hunger for humans. Players will use attack cards from their hands and infection tokens they receive to defeat heroes and turn the humans.&#10;&#10;During other players' turns each opponent will have the opportunity to play hero cards in the hopes of stopping the player. This interaction during other players' turns reduces down time and keeps all players engaged in the game.&#10;&#10;While players are busy with their own struggles, the horde grows from their victims. When the Horde! card appears the players must work together to make sure they do not all lose to the massive horde.&#10;&#10;We Are Dead is easy to learn, but provides enough depth and random elements to allow for good replay-ability. The game uses a hand management mechanic with elements of co-op play and resource management that add layers of strategy to the game.&#10;&#10;",

In any case it&rsquo;s a game with a pinch of &laquo; take that &raquo; and cutthroat maneuvers where you&rsquo;ll get to experience the best UFC games ever. As you may wonder, UFC stands for Ultimate Farming Championship. In 2042, the European Union has long since cut off financial aid to farmers. In order to get out of this situation, farmers created a competition for the installation of electric fences, which very quickly attracted the attention of the public and sponsors.&#10;&#10;So now is the time for you to enter the arena and become the best electric fence installer. During your turn, move your tractor along the paths on the board. Place electric fences behind you. As soon as you surround a plot with your fences, take control of it. As soon as you control a certain number of plots (depending on the number of players), you win the game. However, it will not be that simple. You will need to be on the lookout, as your opponents will try to stop you by cutting your electric fences or playing event cards...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

After the events are resolved, the players bid for the resources. Then the active player uses his action points and resources to acquire building permits, acquire tools or erect buildings which differ in their resource costs and advantages conferred. Bandits may also be used to further the player's goal, but may backfire if the dice are not friendly. Then players engage in a subgame somewhat akin to Blackjack -- but with a greater range of results -- to distribute gold useful for the next auction. What's tricky is to take in more gold diggers than anyone else, but not to take so many that the ensuing brawl wipes out all of the profits. The eventual winner is the player who has managed to construct the best set of buildings with bonuses for achieving multiple buildings of the same type. This player is elected Mayor of Goldrush City.&#10;&#10;Created by the designer of Strand-Cup.&#10;&#10;",

Lucrative advertising contracts are needed for you to profit from your media operations, but they bore and repel your audiences, requiring you to balance profit and sustainability at all times&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided in multiple phases: the business phase, the media phase, the advertising phase, the boredom phase and the mogul phase.&#10;&#10;In the business phase, players must select two actions to branch out into new media outlets, break into new continents and secure advertising contracts. They may purchase a media outlet, draw a media card, invest in their outlets or confirm advertising contracts. Once every player has chosen two actions, the process is repeated twice more. In the media phase, players bid for the attention of patrons on different continents and receive awards according to their global and specific media performance on each continent. Bids are made using permanent content bought for each player's office in the first phase (investment) and temporary content from media cards. To maintain an outlet, players must meet minimum content requirements. In the advertising phase, players earn revenue through advertising from patrons they've attracted. In the boredom phase, players lose patrons from their office according to a pre-determined pattern found on the turn order track. In the mogul phase, the turn order marker is advanced, face up cards are changed and the leading mogul marker is passed to the next player.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the media deck has run out twice or if the turn marker reaches the end of the turn track. The winner is the player with the greatest media value.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Whodunit Card Game: &quot;Murder in the big city, and you must solve the crime.  Brenda's dead, and foul play is suspected. To win, find out who did it, where, when, how, and why.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a card game that shares some similarities with Clue, but adds some other questions to the mix, like what time of day did it happen, and what was the killer's motive? To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.  Obviously, though, this aids the other players as well by eliminating some categories.&#10;&#10;You start with a number of cards, each of which contains a specific clue. As play progresses, you can attempt to accumulate all the clues in a category, which will earn you points based on what turn you choose to reveal your set.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you are allowed to direct a question to a specific player.  The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask &quot;How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?&quot;  or  &quot;How many Jealousy cards have you seen?&quot;  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.&#10;&#10;Your other option during your turn is to make an accusation. You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.&#10;&#10;Cards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.&#10;&#10;Once someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points. The problem with guessing, though, is that wrong answers result in negative points, and the First Accuser loses double!&#10;&#10;",

Following this event, the Queen of Fatal disappeared, and a few enchanters left that world and arrived on Earth.&#10;&#10;The five breaches in Europe gave origin to as many magic birth-signs: Flambeaux (Paris), Aquat&eacute; (Brno), Terranova (Rome), &Aring;ngb&aring;t (Tallinn), Lichtenborn (Nuremberg). Five families who over the centuries kept wavering between open war and armed peace, but who never lived in harmony.&#10;&#10;Since then, the enchanters have influenced humans politics, arts, and science: either directly or by inspiring and taking control over all humans who were useful for their cause, and FATAL is a piece of this tale.&#10;&#10;The game features a deck of 110 cards. Each player belongs to one of the birth-signs and tries to catch the greatest number of treasures by playing &quot;trimagics&quot; (combination of three cards) and/or beating other players.&#10;&#10;During his turn, the player:&#10;&#10;     may play a special &quot;enchantment&quot; card,&#10;     may steal a card in front of another player (with a rock-paper-scissors system printed on the cards),&#10;     may play up to two cards in front of himself.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player has two &quot;virtual&quot; columns where he can play cards: the first card of a column is played normally, the second card is played rotated by 180&deg;, the third card completes the column (the &quot;trimagic&quot;) and must be placed rotated by 90&deg;.&#10;The three cards of a tri-spell have a different meaning: the first card decides the performed action, the second one fixes the number of targets or the power of the spell, the third one closes the trimagic.&#10;&#10;Each player has also a designed enemy (by secret role assignment at the start of the game): if he defeats this player, he is the winner. If nobody reaches this goal, the winner is the player with the most powerful treasures at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Instead they must remember all of those objects and avoid them when naming something themselves. Whoever first names something said previously by an opponent loses the game, and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;The reverse side of the game board features the numbers from 1 to 36, so now you have to remember which digits to avoid instead of which objects.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Redakai is a trading card game using the characters and setting of an animated series of the same name that debuted on the Cartoon Network in the U.S. in 2011.  Redakai cards have Blast 3D technology, making them appear 3D, as well as making attacks appear to animate as the player moves the card.&#10;&#10;In Redakai, a player is trying to eliminate the character(s) controlled by the opponent to win the game. In the basic game, each player starts with one character and on a turn you draw a card from your deck, then play it immediately. The card types are monster &ndash; which are played on your own character to boost defenses and heal damage &ndash; and attack &ndash; which are played on the opponent's character. A character can have defenses in three colors &ndash; green, red, blue &ndash; and if an attack is stronger than a character's defense in that attack's color, then the attack hits and damages the character.&#10;&#10;The cards are transparent and they stack on top of each other during play. A character's health is represented by three damage zones on the card, and if all these zones turn red (by playing one or more attacks on that character), then the character is eliminated. An attack can also cover up and remove a character's defense, while monsters can boost defenses and cover red damage zones with yellow ones, thus healing the character.&#10;&#10;In the advance game, each player controls three characters and starts with a hand of three cards and a maximum Kairu value of three. Each turn, a player boosts his maximum Kairu by one (to a maximum of 20), draws one card, then (optionally) plays monster and attack cards, spending Kairu to do so equal to the cost on each card. Some cards have &quot;react&quot; abilities that allow you to spend Kairu to defend against attacks. At the start of each turn, your Kairu refreshes to its maximum value.&#10;&#10;If you eliminate all three of your opponent's characters, you win the game. If you cannot draw a card on your turn because your deck is exhausted, you lose.&#10;&#10;",

If so (or even if you&rsquo;ve just seen all that goes into it from movies like Mission Impossible and The Da Vinci Code), then you know how incredibly important&mdash;and difficult&mdash;it can be.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Cracked, the fast and furious strategic card game for 2-8 players. In Cracked, players race to be the first to end the game by having four cards in their hand that matches their unique code card. Sound simple? It is. Yet&hellip;it&rsquo;s not. In fact, Cracked was designed to be welcoming to beginning gamers, but still competitive and tactical enough for the more serious gamer in your life.&#10;&#10;To play, players take turns playing one or more cards from their hand in order to match the color or number value on the central card (i.e. the card in the middle of the table). If the central card is a green 6, then you could play a green card, a 6 card, or two cards equaling 6 (i.e. a 5 and a 1). Action cards spice things up a notch, as they can swap hands, force a player to miss a turn, and more. Collect the numbers required by your code card&mdash;and discard anything that doesn&rsquo;t match&mdash;and you win!&#10;&#10;With a fast playtime and high player count, Cracked can be brought out for nearly any social situation. This 2-8 player strategic card game is filled with innovative and unique game mechanics that make every game tense and exciting, perfect for any occasion. The game was designed to be casual and streamlined enough to welcome beginning gamers, but tactical enough to keep the hard-core players challenged. A fine balance between the two will introduce a new gaming experience that has not been felt in this genre of gaming for a while. Do you have what it takes to crack the code and emerge as the best code-cracker around?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

World cards, which are not shuffled into the deck, have info about each world tile. The player who owns that tile takes the card for reference. Character cards have a base strength, class and a home world indicator. They can be played to a tile that you own as defense against attack. If they are played to their home world their strength is doubled. Scroll cards can be placed on worlds and used by characters that can wield magic. These cards boost the base strength. Artifact cards can be used by any character. They boost strength and sometimes have special powers.&#10;&#10;Each player picks a world tile to be his home and places 5 of their 8 cards there to defend it. Players also have a pawn that represents their army.&#10;&#10;During a turn a player first draws 3 cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;Second a player may play up to 2 cards. These cards can be played from his hand to a controlled world, from a controlled world to another controlled world or from a controlled world to his hand.&#10;&#10;Third a player may move his pawn 1 or 2 worlds. If he enters a world controlled by another player he must stop.&#10;&#10;Although not stated in the rules I would assume if a pawn is in a world not claimed by another player he could claim the world and play cards there. If a pawn is in a world occupied by another player you would then have a battle. A battle is fought between the cards on the tile as defense and the cards from the attacking players hand. Calls from allies can be made and other players can contribute to the battles as well.&#10;&#10;The first player to control 8 worlds wins.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to arrive in Anchorage with the most money, which is found through panning for gold, visiting gold mines, and other events along the way. Hazards that players encounter during game play duplicate some of the real-life problems motorists may face driving to Alaska's largest city, such as icy roads, landslides, bears, and everybody's favorite, a boarded-up gas station in the middle of nowhere. &#10;Solid production values here, with some colorful cartoon-style graphics on the Encounter Cards and game board. There's a prospector's &quot;poke&quot; containing some exquisite pewter playing pieces (a la &quot;Monopoly&quot;) that include a moose, a jeep, a bush plane, and a dog sled, among others. The game has plenty of &quot;Yukon Sam Bucks&quot; provided in various denominations, along with a handy storage tray, and is topped off with a pair of substantial dice and a &quot;Rainbow Road/Pan For Gold&quot; spinner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Amigo: Be the fastest one to get the right lucky charm! But which lucky charm is the right one: mushroom, pig or chimney sweep? Your personal lucky number will tell you. You need luck and talent to gather the most cards of all players.&#10;&#10;START OF PLAY&#10;Three target cards are placed in the middle of the table. Each player must be able to reach them well with both his hands. The remaining 63 cards (symbol and touch cards) are shuffled and this deck is placed face down on the table. One player is chosen to be the starting player.&#10;&#10;The Lucky Number&#10;Now each player receives one or more lucky numbers. The starting player places the face down deck in front of him on the table. He reveals the topmost card in such a way that everyone can see it at the same time. The revealed card is either a symbol or a touch card.&#10;&#10;A symbol card shows one to eight small &quot;lucky mushrooms&quot; (blue), &quot;lucky pigs&quot; (yellow) and chimney sweeps (red) in different combinations and in the color of the target cards. When a symbol card is revealed, each player has to find out, how often a symbol is found on the symbol card. If the number of one symbol equals the lucky number of a player he tries to draw the appropriate target card as quickly as possible towards him.&#10;&#10;For each target card a player has successfully drawn he receives a card from the deck. These cards are placed in front of the player. If a player draws (touching counts as drawing) a card, which he was not allowed to draw (e.g. because he miscounted the symbols) he has to put three of his own cards in the jackpot, for each card he has drawn wrongly. If he has less than three cards, all of them have to go into the jackpot.&#10;&#10;The jackpot is a collection of cards (maximum five). It is placed near the target cards. If there are at any time more than five cards in the jackpot, the surplus cards are shuffled back into the deck before revealing the topmost card. At the start of play there is no jackpot.&#10;&#10;After the first player has given a card from the deck to each player who has correctly drawn a target card, the target cards are placed back in the middle of the table. The revealed card is placed in the jackpot as are all the cards the players have lost.&#10;&#10;If a touch card is revealed, quick reactions are called for. Each player tries to touch the matching target card with both his hands, placing one after the other. This will create a huge pile of hands, sometimes in wildly mixed order. The target card remains in the middle of the table. A touch card shows a big &quot;lucky mushroom&quot;, a big &quot;lucky pig&quot; or a big &quot;chimney sweep&quot;.&#10;&#10;Whoever is the first to have only one hand of another player between his two hands (e.g. there are not two or more hands between his two hands (the sandwich)) receives the revealed touch card and the jackpot.&#10;&#10;After the starting player has given the touch card and the jackpot to the winner, this round is finished.&#10;&#10;If there are not enough cards in the deck to give to all players the cards they won, The game ends immediately. The player with the most cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn you place a sneeze card into either the upwind pool (which will make people sneeze immediately) or the downwind pool (which is safe until the wind changes).&#10;&#10;If all of your allergy cards are matched by cards in the upwind pool then you sneeze, that pool clears, you draw another allergy card and both you and the player who made you sneeze draw an 'And Now' (event) card.  These can be played on your turn instead of flipping an allergy card to effect the course of the game (e.g. you hold your breath to avoid sneezing, or play a 'mean trick' to double the effect of one of the cards than an opponent is allergic to).&#10;&#10;When a player with four allergies sneezes they are out--at that point the game switches to 'sudden death' with any player who sneezes being eliminated.&#10;&#10;This is clearly a kids game, but with a few twists of strategy to keep everybody interested, especially around management of 'And Now' cards, and preparing for the switch into the sudden death end game.&#10;&#10;",
