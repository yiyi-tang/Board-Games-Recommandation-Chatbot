If the attacker wins, the two footballers exchange places and the attacker gains possession of the ball.&#10;&#10;To pass the ball to another player or space, you just need to have line of sight to the space you're aiming for and it needs to be in a straight line (like the queen's movement in chess).

In the advanced game mode, players can select armoury cards to provide their units or their whole force with unique abilities.&#10;&#10;Crystal Core features simulated parallel play through the use of command cards, which are selected simultaneously by each player, and define what actions are available for that round. Players must devise a plan for each round, and execute it with a focus on army-cohesion and maneuvering for prime position to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;The game also provides a superior wargaming experience by eliminating several of the upkeep actions associated with wargames, including model-per-model movement, excessive dice rolls, and army wide actions, thereby providing maximum entertainment in a modest timeframe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(now available as Isla Tetra 2 - please check BGG page)&#10;&#10;The first game from Will Sargent's Solway Games uses a colourful new puzzle system to create essential inventory items which can be used to explore the mysterious island, ISLA TETRA.&#10;&#10;The same colourful grids are built to earn Exploration, Health and Fishing actions, making for a puzzling castaway adventure of the like never seen before.&#10;&#10;You might think you can get by simply walking the sun-kissed sands, soaking up the sun, but leave your island escape plan too late and you'll find events back home have taken a turn for the worse: As the months tick by, the search for your crashed plane is eventually called off, your job is readvertised, and your car has been sold to keep up with the bills. After two years of waiting, your family holds a memorial service and your partner is now returning to a social life as a single person. You might be a great survivor, but at what cost?&#10;&#10;Each turn players can beachcomb for useful items such as rope, old bits of wire and driftwood. You might even find a pilot's hat or laminated crash instructions washed up from the azure, salty brine. These pieces of flotsam and jetsam are shown on 52 professionally printed cards and represented by brightly coloured, chunky 3D shapes which can be linked neatly together on your individual player mat to build items essential for survival.&#10;&#10;Players must strike a balance between plundering the island&rsquo;s resources for points while ensuring they&rsquo;re not last off the island. Finish too low down on the time-track and you'll accrue penalty points which could rob you of victory.&#10;&#10;It's all about strategy, and fun puzzle solving. Some of your inventory items can only be built using a single colour, while others allow two or all three. Also, some grids are larger than others, taking longer to build, some are small and awkward to fit all the available shapes into.&#10;&#10;Upgrades can give you more playing power, such as extra card swaps and extra jokers; longer explore moves; greater fish catches. Which to go for first? It's up to you to try the many different combinations.&#10;&#10;To start, you are only allowed to build two items at a time so think carefully... whittle away by the fire at base camp, or set out deep into the island in search of vines and timber to help strengthen your small raft, ready for the final ordeal across raging seas...&#10;&#10;source: from publisher: Solway Games&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Progressive Mancala was invented by Ralf Gering on September 3, 2004, in Bad Breisig, Germany. The game uses a rule which reminds of Progressive Chess.&#10;&#10;The game was implemented for online play at games.wtanaka.com on January 28, 2010.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Progressive Mancala is played on a one-rank mancala board which numbers eleven holes. Initially there are five stones in each hole. There is also a common goal which is adjacent to the central hole of the board. Both players sit on the same side of the board in front of it. One player is called West, the other East.&#10;&#10;East starts to the game and plays from right to left. West sows from left to right.&#10;&#10;On each turn a player empties a hole and then distributes its contents into the following holes, one by one, in his direction. If he reaches the end of the board, he continues to distribute the stones by first dropping a stone into the Goal, then into the holes starting from the opposite end of the board. That is, he circles around the board.&#10;&#10;If the last stone is dropped into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last distributed stone) are picked up and then distributed as usual in multi-lap games.&#10;&#10;The move ends if the last stone is dropped into an empty hole or the goal.&#10;&#10;For each move that a player has terminated in an empty hole, his enemy must make a bonus move (bonus moves are compulsory).&#10;&#10;If the last stone is dropped into the goal, the player captures its contents including the last distributed stone. The captured stones are stored. Dropping the last stone into the goal never results in a bonus move for the opponent.&#10;&#10;The player who captured most stones is declared the winner. Draws are impossible because the sum of all stones is odd.&#10;&#10;Expert Variant&#10;&#10;Good players may take a board which has 17 holes. Again, there are five stones in each hole at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Only 6 sided dice are needed.  46 pages plus 1 quick sheet.&#10;&#10;The &quot;square bashing&quot; system, as it has been named, is a departure from normal miniature systems in that it imposes a seven by five square grid over the battlefield. This grid affects movement and combat - doing away with tedious millimeter measurements and allows the player to focus on maneuvering his units and rolling the dice. Squares can be either open (no impediment to movement) or closed (terrain impedes movement).&#10;&#10;Equipment needed for the game:&#10;&#10;     A Table (7' x 5') marked out in a 1 foot grid.&#10;     Some pieces of terrain.&#10;     An army for each player. Most armies will have ~22 units and 2 generals. Normally, a unit consists of 4 bases, except Character, Artillery, Chariot, Monster consist of 1 base only.&#10;     About 15 Dice (Ordinary 6 sided dice)&#10;     Some dead body models to represent casualties for the purpose of morale tests.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The object of Royal Chess is to capture the Royal Family (the King and Queen pieces). You pick up five chess cards and if you have the corresponding chess piece, then you can move it like regular chess. But because your opponent does not know what cards you have, they may make very risky moves and may even try to bluff you!&#10;&#10;After you play a card, you pick up a new one and always have five cards to choose from. There are also two Jester cards (wild cards) which can be played to re-claim or move any of your pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1862. &#10;Abraham Lincoln has passed the Pacific Railway Act which will connect the United States' coasts via the first Transcontinental Railroad.&#10;You are a wry investor and a shrewd negotiator. 4 new railroad companies have amassed a large amount of capital to accomplish this task set forth by Lincoln.&#10;These companies need businessmen like you, to negotiate land grants for them to connect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.&#10;This is where you come in, to help these companies expand and develop their business.&#10;&#10;Players will invest in 4 companies by building tracks for them.&#10;To do this, they will buy land grants (cards) in 4 colors, numbered 1 through 6, each color matching spaces on the map board.&#10;To be valid, the land grants must be played in order of construction, of the right color and must be in ascending or descending order numerically.&#10;&#10;Once built, the track will give a bonus to the player (from the company's own cash), one bonus to the company (from the bank), raise the company's value and the player gets a stock from the company.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, each company needs to pay its expenses: 1$ for each city in its network.&#10;&#10;If a company has no more cash in its reserve, it will have to lower its company value to pay for those expenses.&#10;&#10;Game ends when one of these 5 conditions is met:&#10;&#10;- one company reaches 100 on the company value track&#10;- one company has no more stock&#10;- one company has no more tracks to build new rails&#10;- one company reaches 10 cities in it's network&#10;- one company connects the east and west coasts&#10;&#10;Stock value is calculated and each player gets a payout.&#10;Players evaluate their Bonus cards, dealt at the beginning of the game.&#10;The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Available from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Second way is by capturing ten of your opponent's tokens.&#10;&#10;RULES FOR PLAY&#10;One player selects all the tokens of one color. The second player takes all the tokens of the other color. Players choose for first play. The starting player places a token on one of the four circles reading, START. Tokens are not moved from spaces once they are placed on board. Play then alternates between players who then place tokens anywhere on the board. (However, to work out successful patterns of play, do not place your tokens too wide apart. By concentrating your tokens in definite areas, you will be better able to fulfill the objective of the game&ndash;5 tokens in a row.) Your 5 tokens must be placed consecutively in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row. If you succeed in accomplishing this, you are declared the winner. The other method of winning is to capture ten of your opponent's men. A capture is performed by surrounding two of your opponent's tokens by placing two of your tokens one on each side of his. If a player places his tokens in a position so as to become out-flanked, he loses the out-flanked pair of tokens to his opponent. When a capture is completed, the captured tokens are removed from the playing field and placed in the &quot;CAPTURED OPPONENTS&quot; area of board. In this way, both you and your opponent can readily see how the game is progressing. Five pairs (10) of captured opponents constitute a win. Included in the set are more tokens than are necessary to complete the game. However, it is possible that a game could be played out without anyone winning. In this case, the game ends in a draw.&#10;&#10;Chek-ro is similar to ninuki-renju and Pente&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of the game is to strike 15 (either red or green coloured) rings into two of the four pockets by using a 26 inch cue. The cue is used to aim a large black ring at the coloured rings.&#10;&#10;In the two player version each player has to eliminate one colour from the board into pockets of the same colour as the rings. The four player version is a two-team game. Players take turns in cueing. The player or team to succeed first in removing their rings from the board wins.&#10;The goal in the single-player version is to remove the rings from the board in as few turns as possible.&#10;&#10;There is a certain similarity between the H-ring Spel, American Carrom and Korona.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the &quot;Letter from the author&quot; page:&#10;&quot;The games included in this 'Ten Sports Games To Play With Dice' have been developed and played by my family and friends for over 20 years.  Foregoing the more traditional board games which sell for five and ten dollars and more, we would take our pencil and paper and a pair of dice and develop a game of our own.  This way, we could make the game suit whatever mood we were in.  Being avid sports fans like yourself, we often developed different sports games that we could use to capture the excitement of real sports.  So over the years we gradually accumulated the rules for dice games in nearly every popular sport.&quot;&#10;&#10;Includes the following games:&#10;&#10;     Dice Baseball&#10;     Dice Football&#10;     Dice Basketball by Players&#10;     Dice Hockey&#10;     Dice Basketball - Scholastic Quarters&#10;     Dice Soccer&#10;     Dice Baseball - Team Play&#10;     Dice Basketball - Professional&#10;     Dice Bowling&#10;     Dice Wrestling&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Decipher was an entry in the 2005 About.com Deduction Game Design Competition. It only uses a standard deck of cards and 6 tokens (pennies, gamecounters, etc.)&#10;&#10;&quot;Can you crack the code in time? In Decipher, you must figure out your opponent's hidden code before they figure out yours. It requires logic, deduction, and strategic cardplay.&quot;&#10;&#10;In this game players try to crack the hidden three-card code of their opponent by playing one, two or three cards in front of the hidden code. Your opponent will show you whether your guess was correct or not. If you made a correct guess, you know that you only know half of the truth: was the suit correct or the rank of the card? That's for you to find out before you run out of cards.&#10;&#10;",
