    "Description": "Star Trek Battle Manual was Zocchi's first foray into space combat games. It is very similar to his later Alien Space Battle Manual and Star Fleet Battle Manual, with good reason. Zocchi did not have a license to publish a Star Trek game when this came out, and in addition to the title the game uses images of ships from the series (the Enterprise is on the cover), not to mention the names and pictures of the characters. Paramount objected and Zocchi was forced to recall the game from stores. A few copies had already been sold, which are the ones occasionally seen today.&#10;&#10;The following year, Zocchi released Alien Space Battle Manual, with all the Star Trek references replaced with ones he invented. When he obtained a license from Franz Josef Designs (allowing him to use ship designs and names such as &quot;Klingon&quot;), he published Star Fleet Battle Manual.&#10;&#10;In this game, optional rules are given for the special abilities of some of the Enterprise crew - these of course do not appear in the later games.&#10;&#10;",

It consists of six collecting boards divided into nine grid squares, and 54 picture cards that magnify the village images on the collecting squares. The picture cards have grid references on their backs.&#10;&#10;There are three games that can be played. The Solo Game asks the child to go through the picture cards one by one and match the grid references to the correct square on the right collecting board. When all cards are placed, the child then turns the cards over to see if the pictures correspond to those on the boards.&#10;&#10;The Lotto Game doles out the collecting boards to each child. Each child in turn takes a card and shows it to everyone. If a player recognizes it as one that belongs on their board, that child gets the card. The first one to fill up the board is the winner.&#10;&#10;In the Skill Game, the boards are connected to create a large village. The cards are turned up one by one, and the first child to call out the correct grid reference wins the card. The child with the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Up to eight people can play as individuals. Eighteen people can play as partners. Each person (or partnership) is randomly assigned an occupation: manufacturer, planter, jeweler, broker, inventor, doctor, lawyer or publisher. Each player begins the game with a wad of cash. Each player will move one&rsquo;s own playing piece along the game board&rsquo;s track. Players move along the gameboard according to a pair special dice, which, together, yield a random number from, zero to six. Along the way, each player must buy all six sections of an assigned possession as a victory condition.&#10;&#10;The gameboard is divided into six sections. No player may advance to the next section until all the players have completed the previous section:&#10;Paths of Fortune - Each player moves along a separate path using only one die.  Players may pay and collect money from each other. Each player has a guide card, which says what to pay or collect and from whom as one advances along the path.&#10;The Trading Area - Four trains, four planes, four ships and four buses are placed on random Purchase spaces in this area. Here players can buy transportation for use in the next section for price determined by a spinner or barter with other players.&#10;Transportation Department - If a player owns the method of transportation on the space landed there is no penalty. If the player does not own the method of the transportation landed on that player must pay all the players who possess that vehicle. The penalty escalates with the number of vehicles of the designated type owned.&#10;The Jamboree - Whenever two or more players land on the same space, all the players on that space spin the spinner and the player who gets the lowest number pays the penalty the space assigns.&#10;&lsquo;Round and &lsquo;Round Circle - If a player has yet to own all six parts on the assigned possession, the player must buy the remaining parts at double the price spun on the spinner. Advancing in this section means paying other players because of their occupation or because one lacks the transportation mode the space asks for. Players continue in this section until rolling doubles.&#10;The Pay Off - Players sell their possessions back to the bank for whatever space on which they land.&#10;&#10;When all the players have reached the end of The Pay Off section, each type of vehicle is sold back to the bank for values as determined by the spinner. Bank loans are paid back at 50% interest. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

The children in the family liked to play with the nativity set so the pieces are scattered throughout the house. Players must use logic to correctly discover which piece was the last to be found, which room it was found in, and who found it.&#10;&#10;This is a Christian Family game, which uses a mechanic similar to that of Clue (the cards players try to identify are placed in an envelope under the board), but without the murder theme. There are variations provided in the rules to make it more or less challenging depending on the ages of the children involved.&#10;&#10;The game features a miniature nativity set and distinctive art on the board, box, and player tokens. The game also came with an offer from the publishers to order new custom drawn player tokens of your family based on a photo you mailed in.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This roll-and-move game features a winding yellow track on top of a green (grassy) background.  It's &quot;a jolly game for 2, 3, or 4 players.&quot; From the Powerhouse Museum &quot;The game is significant because it uses scenarios familiar to Australian country motorists during the first half of the twentieth century, when Australian roads were largely poor, gravel sections and steep hills made conditions treacherous, and cars were unreliable. The poor road conditions sometimes saw cars needing major repairs to axles and springs. Another very Australian obstacle on the road was a flock of sheep. The game reflects the poor state of the roads and the uncertainty of arriving at your destination without some mishap occurring. The aim of the game is to progress from the petrol station at the 'start' and travel to the gate marked 'home' via 100 squares numbered 1 to 100. Players move from the start to finish as quickly as possible by taking it in turns to throw the dice. Along the way various motoring obstacles, calamities, and misadventures including punctures, collisions, wrong turns, road blocks, flocks of sheep, bridges under repair, gravel on the road, broken springs, steep hills and axle trouble must be negotiated. These all require the player to miss throws or return to the start.&#10;&#10;There is several versions of this game and several board sizes produced. The earliest version was registered in 1910 and most likely continued till the late 1930s or early 1940s. In the first version the designer cryptically placed the date of publishing in the number plate of the car closest to home.&#10;&#10;",

The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.&#10;&#10;The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:&#10;&#10;-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.&#10;-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.&#10;-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.&#10;-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.&#10;&#10;",

All in a seamless game system that still focuses on playability and elegance.&#10;&#10;Decision in Normandy was originally published in 1981 by Epoch games of Japan.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play&#10;&#10;German Player Turn:&#10;&#10;    Weather&#10;    1st Movement Phase&#10;    1st Combat Phase&#10;    1st Reorganization Phase&#10;    Reaction Phase&#10;    2nd Movement Phase&#10;    2nd Combat Phase&#10;    2nd Reorganization Phase&#10;&#10;&#10;Allied Player Turn: The Allied Player Turn is similar to the German Player Turn, but replaces the Weather phase with Naval Gunfire and Air Attacks.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;2 x 34 by 20 inch maps&#10;880 Counters&#10;28 page rulebook&#10;2 player aides&#10;&#10;Solitaire rating: Excellent&#10;Complexity: Meduim&#10;Playing time: 10-12 hours for the 12 turn campaign game.&#10;Scenarios: 3&#10;&#10;Designer: Ginichiro Suzuki&#10;Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;Graphic Artist: Niko Eskubi&#10;&#10;",

Players advance by answering up to four religious questions per turn. Odd numbered questions are about faith/religious knowledge and even numbered questions are about Good Works. Each questions answered increases the number of spaces the player can move.&#10;&#10;If a player answers a Faith question incorrectly, his or her turn is over. If he or she answers a Good Works question incorrectly, then the pawn is moved off the Strait and Narrow Path and onto a detour, which lengthens the route to heaven.&#10;&#10;The first person to make it to the Celestial Kingdom is not the winner. Also, the rules encourage helping players that are falling behind. The game ends when all players arrive, thus emphasizing that Families should work together so that everyone makes it to heaven.&#10;&#10;",

It also features sound effects to include explosions.&#10;&#10;Like the classic Chinese checkers game board reconfigured as &quot;Canadian checkers&quot; for Canada's centennial in 1967, now there's Electronic Hydro Battle--an even more elaborate, tricked-out version of that other battleship-sinking game, which here shall remain nameless. Apparently it's no longer enough that an opponent calls out grid coordinates in an effort to find and sink the hidden fleet you've placed on your side of the board. With Electronic Hydro Battle, players guess the location of opponents' ships by inserting a wired &quot;torpedo launcher&quot; into the screen, switchboard-style. Missile sounds are heard; if you strike an opposing craft, you'll also hear a blast, followed by the spectacle of your victim getting sprayed with a squirt of water from the game's refillable tank! Whether this funky marriage of &quot;Mighty Mo&quot; and Gong Show represents a high-water mark of fun or a sign of low tide is up to you.&#10;&#10;The object of Hydro Battle game is to be the first player to destroy all five of your opponent's ships. If the Launching Sound is followed by a Blast Sound that will also be followed with your opponent getting sprayed.&#10;&#10;",

His arm is pulled back behind a lever and the ball (marble) is placed on a stand in front of the bowlers right arm. Place the ten wooden pins on the ten markers.

For certain situations you can even earn a gold medal.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player with the most points for the best kart, the most money, the most rounds in the lead, the best actions, for holding the gold medal etc.&#10;&#10;There is also a variant to play as an elimination race, the last one staying upright is the winner !&#10;&#10;",

When you open it, you see a hole in an insert cardboard mask, also depicting a parrot. Below this mask is a two-sided ramp with a plateau in the middle, where you notice a circle.&#10;&#10;If you find one or more parrot-puzzle-piece(s) touching the circle, you can take them to complete the parrot on your mat.&#10;Pieces you already claimed before are put back in the box.&#10;&#10;The completed parrot is worth different points, regarding how much different colours it contains (the more the better).&#10;&#10;",
