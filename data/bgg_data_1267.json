    "Description": "Napoleon's Wars is an exciting and well designed set of wargame rules for the Napoleonic period.&#10;&#10;They allow you to take the role of Generals and re-fight battles in miniature using any scale figures from 2mm to 28mm. &#10;Most importantly, they do not require the use of dice. &#10;The mechanisms used to control your armies encourage you to use the tactics of the period. &#10;The rules pit you very much against your opponent in the combat process. &#10;Everything you need in one book to refight your battles and campaigns including army lists, scenarios and campaign rules.&#10;A Divisional sized battle can be completed within two hours and a Corps level battle within three hours. &#10;The rules are flexible enough to allow players to fight solo, two-player as well as multi-player battles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is not beyond the ingenuity of Hitler&rsquo;s military schemers to carry bombing planes in sections across the Atlantic by submarine and slip them through the slim cordons of the naval patrols in to the Hudson Bay area. There, on some lonely island, safe from the eyes of all except an occasional Indian, those planes could be assembled and made ready for an attack on the Soo ship canal. &mdash;&mdash; Lieutenant Colonel Harold A. Furlong, February 1942.&#10;&#10;Hitting Home is an introductory level game about Axis raids on the Soo Locks during WWII. The Soo Locks were a crucial choke point for the shipment of all of the iron ore used by US and Canadian steel mills. Air raids by German and Japanese aircraft were planned by all sides.&#10;&#10;Although never carried out, strikes against this crucial Home Front installation could have had a profound impact on the war&rsquo;s outcome. Hitting Home allows players to explore the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; of German or Japanese attacks against the Soo Locks.&#10;&#10;The 1942 scenario portrays a German attack using disguised merchant ships to transport Heinkel (He) 115 and 114 floatplane bombers to Hudson Bay. There the aircraft would have been unloaded, armed and taken off to attack the Soo Locks about 600 miles to the south and west. Since the range of the He-114 aircraft would be insufficient for the planes to make a return trip back to the transports, it is assumed the planes would have landed in a lake on the return leg and been picked up by the larger He-115 or other floatplanes designated for search and rescue.&#10;&#10;The 1945 scenario portrays an attack launched from two Japanese I-400 attack submarines. These massive submarines carried three Aichi M6A bombers in hangers. The bombers were launched from a catapult that ran along the top of the ship&rsquo;s bow. It is assumed 4 of these bombers would be used in the attack (based on the presumption that it would be very remarkable for all 3 of a submarine&rsquo;s aircraft to be operational at the same time).&#10;&#10;&mdash;based on description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As the first Spike! Journal to be published after the new edition of Blood Bowl, the content has been adjusted ever so slightly, but it will feel quite familiar to long-time sports fans. It includes:&#10;&#10;- Things That Go Bump in the Night: covers where Necromantic Horror teams arise from, as well as an overview of each position &ndash; Zombie Linemen, Ghoul Runners, Wraiths, Werewolves, and Flesh Golems.&#10;&#10;- Famous Necromantic Horror teams, including the Wolfenburg Crypt-stealers, Bruendar Grimjacks, and Pumpkin Patch Petrifiers, plus full profiles for the Star Players that can be hired.&#10;&#10;- Star Player Spotlight: Frank &rsquo;n&rsquo; Stein &ndash; the Flesh Golem that combined the brains and brawn of two decent players to become something greater than the sum of his parts.&#10;&#10;- Dirt From the Dugout: Mindy Piewhistle returns with the graveyard dirt on rumours of a Star Player's potential retirement &ndash; could he have a life after the gridiron?&#10;&#10;- Star Player Spotlight: Wilhelm &lsquo;the Wolfman&rsquo; Chaney &ndash; growing up as an outcast from Human society has made Wilhelm a somewhat eccentric personality, but his savagery in the field more than make up for it.&#10;&#10;- Sylvanian Night-time Leagues: Custom rules for running a league season as the Spooky Skull Cup, as well as special rules to represent games played in Sylvania.&#10;&#10;- Chat with the Rat: Hackspit sits down with the coach of the Bruendar Grimjacks about scouting and recruiting new players for Necromantic Horror teams.&#10;&#10;- Trick or Treat: the pro playbook for new Necromantic Horror coaches, including advice on raising a solid roster, developing their skills, and running effective plays.&#10;&#10;- Star Player Spotlight: Bryce &lsquo;the Slice&rsquo; Cambuel &ndash; after a premature and self-inflicted end to his career as a living player, this chainsaw-wielding Blocker was revived to give it another go in the afterlife.&#10;&#10;- Eerie Inducements: hire some of the unsavoury characters that abound in these dark and dismal lands.&#10;&#10;- A new episode of Mighty Blow!&#10;&#10;",

A blasted wasteland of hills and extensive maglev lines and roads.&#10;&#10;- Side 2: New Rynn City N292-W451 &ndash; one of the beleaguered districts of the city.&#10;&#10;You will need a copy of the Rynn's World Air Campaign book or the Aeronautica Imperialis: Wings of Vengeance boxed game to use this game board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overview and goal:&#10;&#10;Radius is a game for two players played on the cells of a hexagonal board. You will need 2 pawns in blue and 2 in orange and a supply of blue and orange stones.&#10;&#10;The goal is to end up owning a greater number of connected stones when there are no moves left.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&#10;The board starts out empty. One player plays with the blue pieces the other with the orange. Players in turn place a pawn on an empty cell until all 4 pawns are on the board.&#10;&#10;Decide who goes first, turns then alternate.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;&#10;A pawn must move (n) steps in a straight line such that it ends up at an empty cell with at least (n) cells immediately adjacent to it that are either empty or occupied by enemy stones (note that pawns are not stones). At least one of these must be empty. Then you must place a stone on (n) of these cells, with the restriction that at least one of the stones must be placed on an empty cell. If you place it on a cell with an enemy stone, that stone is removed first. The only thing that obstructs pawn movement is other pawns and the edge of the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Special thanks to Michael Amundsen for his excellent rules editing.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Astra Militarum are rightly feared by the enemies of the Imperium for the quantity of their ground troops, and the quality of their ordnance. Where aircraft are set to operate, static ground-based weapons batteries will often be deployed in advance to protect vital assets and add to the fleet&rsquo;s firepower.&#10;&#10;Hydra flak batteries are common across Imperial war zones. The version used by the Astra Militarum can be erected quickly, and then dismantled and sent to the advancing front as needed. Their quad-barrelled cannons fill the skies with a storm of lethal shrapnel.&#10;&#10;Basilisk Anti-aircraft Emplacements hurl massive Earthshaker shells to saturate the air with clouds of burning debris, tearing apart airframes and smashing engines to bits. When deployed in clusters, an entire section of the sky becomes a near-impenetrable wall of deadly flak.&#10;&#10;This finely-detailed resin kit allows you to build one of each type of ground weapon, including two heavily-armoured bunkers in which to house them, plus a fuel depot to be used as an objective during your games. All three of these resin kits feature the rough-and-ready aesthetics of the Imperial Guard, visually distinct from the ground assets of the Imperial Navy.&#10;&#10;The set includes:&#10;- 1 resin Hydra flak battery&#10;- 1 resin Basilisk Anti-aircraft emplacement&#10;- 1 resin fuel depot&#10;&#10;Profiles (stat cards) for the two weapon emplacements are included.

They will have to manage the speed and the trajectory of their cars while limiting as much as possible their risk and damages: beware of the collision or the exit of track!&#10;&#10;At each turn, players simultaneously plan their next move, then they all apply their move in the race order and finally resolve special situations such as slipstream, loss of control, collision or run-off.&#10;&#10;The cars' movements are inspired by real-life physics: each movement influences the next one. As in real driving situations, drivers must anticipate their movements, take into account elements such as inertia or acceleration in order to optimize their speed and trajectory. The more the drivers exceed their cars capabilities, the more they risk losing control, which can cause accidents and impact the driver's strategy. But the victorious drivers are also often those who have flirted with the limits to overtake their opponents!&#10;&#10;In the standard game mode, all drivers' cars have the same capabilities.&#10;The Pro Driver mode increases the strategical aspect by introducing :&#10;- Management of weather conditions&#10;- Qualifying phase played by auctions&#10;- Unique car capabilities (up to 20 different cars, each one having its own characteristics)&#10;- Obstacles and Dirt on the racetrack&#10;&#10;",

Play the world countries, build renewable power plants to reduce fossil-based CO2. Carbon neutralizes countries before 5 climate disasters or 10 years ends the game. A game plays around 90-120 minutes. Are you ready to save Terra?&#10;&#10;Terraternity = Terra + eternity&#10;Terra is the Latin word for earth, and eternity means the infinite time that never ends. We created Terraternity to raise awareness about the efforts needed to heal our planet and preserve it for future generations.&#10;Every day we all place more CO2 on our planet without effort living our lives. In Terraternity, we created a game mechanic placing CO2 cubes on a Terra Globe. This is easy and fun, and when the game progressed, it creates challenges, tension, and hopefully awareness.&#10;&#10;Game Overview&#10;Your goal is to develop renewable power plants in various countries to make them carbon neutral. You will first need to &lsquo;activate&rsquo; a country, which lets you build renewable power plants within it but adding its CO2 output - literally! - to the Terraternity globe. You&rsquo;ll need to make sure this globe stays balanced - too many CO2 cubes, and you risk a climate disaster - while also balancing that country&rsquo;s CO2 footprint. Successfully balance enough countries before time runs out or disaster strikes, and you win!&#10;Game Modes&#10;You can play Terraternity in two different game modes:&#10;&#10;Competitive Game&#10;You are on your own to turn five countries carbon neutral before any other player. Keep your hand and strategy secret while you place victory points on your player board and collect green cubes from carbon neutralized countries.&#10;&#10;Cooperative Game&#10;You work together with all players to turn eight countries carbon neutral.&#10;Everybody plays with an open hand &ndash; sharing strategies is highly recommended as you all play against the board and win or lose together! &#10;Progress is tracked on the CO2 scale on the Game board.&#10;&#10;Solo Mode&#10;In the solo mode you play against the board and try to achieve and master the different stages. Are you able to master the MSP Stage - they heigst possible challenge which makes you the Most Sustainable Player?&#10;&#10;",

Every day, among a multitude of strange objects and ingredients, hundreds of items coveted by all witches are sold in order to cook their magic potions. Harpy blood, crowfoot, frog legs, glass eyes, unicorn horn are just some of the items that witches will mix in their old cauldrons.&#10;&#10;Trade items with the rest of the Exponentia merchants, mislead your rivals, while deducing which witches will come to buy. Fill your sack with Patacabr&euro;uros before anyone else to win the game!&#10;&#10;Pata de Cabra is a family party for 2 to 6 players, recommended from 8 years old and with an approximate duration of 25 minutes.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;In Pata de Cabra, with cunning and a bit of mischief, you will have to be the first merchant to fill your bag of Patacabr &euro; uros to win the game, selling the witches the items they need to put in their cauldron to make the magic potions. When they all hit the market, it will be time to sell.&#10;&#10;Take out your merchant skills to convince other players and get rid of the items you do not want. If you are a good merchant, you will get the hand that will make you fill your sack with Patacabr &euro; uros.&#10;&#10;Being able to mislead the rest of the players is essential to achieve victory. Only one will become the best merchant in Exponentia.&#10;&#10;In Pata de Cabra we will find 5 types of elements, each of them related to a witch:&#10;&#10;Goat's Leg - Black Witch&#10;&#10;Harpy Blood - Red Witch&#10;&#10;Frog Legs - Green Witch&#10;&#10;Glass Eye - Blue Witch&#10;&#10;Unicorn Horn - Yellow Witch&#10;&#10;HOW DOES IT PLAY?&#10;&#10;The player with the most witch's face is in charge of preparing the game. He will distribute a Patacabr &euro; uros sack tablet and a coin counter that we will place at number 0 on the tablet. The Patacabr &euro; uros must be earned! You will separate the cards into two decks, the element deck and the witch deck. In addition, each player will draw 7 item cards and witch cards (it will vary depending on the number of players), and we will be ready to start the first round.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of three phases of exchanges. After each exchange phase there will be a witch phase. When a witch is revealed during this phase, her magic will be activated immediately.&#10;&#10;After the third and final witch phase, the round will end with the sale phase, where the Patacabr &euro; uros will be earned.&#10;&#10;Watch out! Not all items can be sold for the same value. The power that a single element contains is so enormous that only two expert witches will be able to extract its power for the spell to work and the potion to be carried out successfully. If there are three, the power of the elements could be destabilized causing the cauldron to explode, it would be a risk that only some witches would dare to take if they are made a generous offer. Depending on the number of witches on the table at the end of the round, the items will be sold for one value or another.&#10;&#10;When someone collects 25 Patacabr &euro; uros, or more, the game is over. The best merchant in Exponentia wins!&#10;&#10;If after the first round no one has collected at least 25 Patacabr &euro; uros, continue the game and start another new round with the market day.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Batalla de Calama (The Battle of Calama) reenacts the first battle in the War of the Pacific. A larger force of Chilean troops defeated a group of Bolivian soldiers and civilians near the town of Calama on March 23, 1879.&#10;&#10;The game is a wargame for two players, one in control of the Chilean troops and one commanding the Bolivian forces. Depending on the difficulty level, the Chilean side can outnumber the Bolivian side by nearly two to one.&#10;&#10;Battle of Calama is a simple dice game. There are dice in various colors which determine the amount of troops that can be moved, whether a change of direction is possible, and the outcome of the battles. The troop strength serves as a modifier in battle. The goal is to occupy the entire town.&#10;&#10;",

The game Combate a&eacute;reo reenacts this fight.&#10;&#10;The game reenacts this battle on a map of 8 by 8 squares. Each player has a personal board with controls of their plane, plus a sketch of the enemy plane. On this they plan their movement and attacks, adjusting altitude, speed, zones of attack and so on. The players can use various tokens to mark their plans on their respective boards. Afterwards, the move their planes on the map. The relative position and altitude of the two planes determines the zones that can be attacked.&#10;&#10;Combat is modified by dice rolling. The goal is to either entirely destroy a section of the enemy plane, or deal enough damage overall to shoot it down. The game ends in a draw if both planes end up in the same position at the same altitude and crash.&#10;&#10;",

Exorcists deduce the true name of a demon, the name being a hidden four-digit number.&#10;&#10;One player is the demon king, and chooses its secret name from four digits in order. The other players are the exorcists, and must deduce the demon's name. If they do, it loses all its power and they win.&#10;&#10;The demon also possesses one of the exorcists in secret at the start of the game (they don't know it) and can lie when answering this exorcist, thus sowing lies in their midst.&#10;&#10;The exorcists start the game knowing one of the digits each. They can discuss their ideas for a few minutes, and then in turn, each exorcist makes a claim of the four digit number. The demon answers in such a way that they might deduce which numbers are correct, and in the correct place.&#10;&#10;If the exorcists discover the true name within the time limit, they win (and lose if they fail so), but only if they also can conceal who knows which number. For if they land on the correct sequence, the demon king and its possessed aide can now discuss which exorcist had which digit. If they get this correct, the demon king escapes victorious with the assistant.&#10;&#10;The game includes rules for playing online. The game is published in Japanese and English.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Dragon&rsquo;s Lair is a frantic, fast paced treasure collection game with survival elements. Players work to evade a wide range of fierce dragon attacks while gathering an assortment of rubies, emeralds and gold. Challenge the dragon alone or with friends as you compete to gather as much treasure as you can before your luck runs out. Do you dare enter The Dragon&rsquo;s Lair?&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&#10;Separate out one blink per player to be treasure hunter (player) blinks and one blink to be the dragon.&#10;Triple click a blink to set to treasure hunter, long press to set blink to dragon (hold off until ready to start the game), double press to set back to lair tile.&#10;Arrange all remaining non-player (lair) blinks around the dragon in any configuration desired as long as each blink has one side open for connection.&#10;Alt Setup - If only playing with 6-9 blinks, arrange blinks in a straight line with the dragon at the end.&#10;Long press the designated dragon blink to set role and start the game.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Treasures randomly spawn into the lair playspace for the players to collect.&#10;Treasure hunter (player) blinks have three colored sides - Yellow (Gold), Red (Rubies), and Green (Emeralds).&#10;Players must match the correctly colored side of their blink to a treasure to score points.&#10;Each red (ruby) and green (emerald) collected gains the player 1 point, while each yellow (gold) collected gives the player 5 points.&#10;Yellow (Gold) treasures require the play to mine (be connected to them) for 3 seconds before awarding their points.&#10;Players collect treasure points until their luck runs out (all 3 luck lost).&#10;One luck is lost by incorrectly connecting to a treasure or by being adversely affected by a dragon attack.&#10;The players current luck count is displayed by the three white lights on the treasure hunter blink.&#10;The Dragon has three attacking moves:&#10;A. Fireball - Orange light (Fire) moves quickly throughout the lair. Any player attached to an actively affected tile looses one luck.&#10;B. Poison - Pink light (Poison) moves slowly throughout the lair. Any player attached to an actively affected tile looses one luck.&#10;C. Void - All light is sucked from the Lair, and players must collect tiles based on their memory. The incorrect matching penalty of one health still applies.&#10;Dragon attacks get more frequent as the game progresses eventually resulting in the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Win Condition / End Game:&#10;&#10;After a player has lost all of their luck, their blink changes over to score mode.&#10;In score mode, lights of different colors flash in quick succession followed by a several second gap.&#10;To determine your score, count the number of Gold flashes in the group and multiply by 100, and then red by 10 and green by 1. The sum of these numbers is your score.&#10;If playing single player, try to set and beat your high score.&#10;If playing competitively with multiple players, the player with the highest score when their luck runs out wins.&#10;&#10;",

A player selects a PopSavvy card and chooses one question from five categories - SELF, LIFE, lOVE, HOME, or WORLD. Eg. &quot;Does drunkenness reveal the true character of a person&quot;? Each player votes YES or NO on a scoresheet, predicts how many players will vote YES, discovers how many actually voted YES, and earns a score based on how accurate their prediction was. After several questions, the most socially savvy person will reveal themselves.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player creates a squad of 5 warriors from a selection of 50, then squares off against the enemy in a furious close-combat fight.&#10;&#10;After each player deploys their warriors, the members of each squad are revealed and the battle begins. Each warrior has a unique ability, realm traits, and a racial restriction. Players alternate turns with one warrior acting at a time based upon the order determined in their deployment. A warrior can use their turn to attack the enemy squad by rolling a d10 and allocating damage (called a Standard Attack) or by using their warrior ability or realm ability as an alternate way to deliver damage or otherwise alter the flow of battle.&#10;&#10;While many warriors have offensive abilities, many others have defensive, retaliatory, healing, summoning, or a wide variety of other abilities. The interactions and synergies of the warriors each player selects for their squads will have a major impact on the battle. The first player to reduce all enemy warriors to zero health wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It can be played with or without the expansion, although the dog houses and tree-poop tiles are not used.&#10;&#10;To set up, shuffle the tiles face-down on the table. Each player then draws a tile without showing it to the other players, looks at it, then keeps it before them facing down so the other players can&rsquo;t see it. If both dogs are the same (i.e. it is a double tile) then discard the tile to the supply and re-draw until you get a tile with two different dogs; then reshuffle the supply. This is your &quot;mission tile&quot;. Each player then draws a second tile; this is your &quot;playing tile&quot;.&#10;&#10;The first player places her playing tile on the table face-up. Then, starting with the second player, players take turns in anticlockwise order, placing their playing tile on the table adjacent to at least one placed tile so that the tiles fit into an imaginary hexagonal grid, then drawing a new playing tile from the supply (if possible). The dogs of adjacent tiles don&rsquo;t need to match.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last tile has been placed on the table, and each player then calculates her score. For each of the two dogs on your mission tile, find the largest contiguous, connected group of that dog. Count the number of dogs in that group. Once you have counted the largest group for each of your two dogs, multiply these two values to determine your score.&#10;&#10;The player with the lowest score wins. In case of a tie, the tied player who played her final tile first wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spitfire Ace: Daylight Air Defense Over Britain: 1940 is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a Royal Air Force fighter during the Battle of Britain. Each turn consists of a sortie in which a contact interception mission will be flown from one of many bases in South-East England, attempting to destroy incoming German. Spitfire Ace is based on the popular, action-packed Nightfighter Ace / Interceptor Ace game system by Gregory M. Smith with a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion (if an officer) and receive awards.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of an R.A.F. fighter pilot and rack up kills. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may pull strings to arrange a transfer to other fighter bases in an attempt to get &quot;closer to the action&quot; or use their influence to adopt more effective tactics. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player's eventual goal &ndash; to become the bomber killer of the Battle of Britain.&#10;&#10;Where many air combat games focus on accumulating hardware, the emphasis in this game is on developing the skills and tactics that will enable you to (a) survive and (b) shoot down enemy aircraft. Your approach in the game is characterized by various skill and benefits including Pilot skills, Wingman skills, tactical changes, and Prestige Level.&#10;&#10;Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot, squadron and aircraft type, play proceeds by checking for incoming raid information. Play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the German raiders. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the possibility that your airfield may have been bombed while you were engaging the enemy. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a change of tactics, or request a change of base. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until end of October 1940 should you make it through unscathed.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;    Time Scale: 3-4 days per turn&#10;    Map Scale: abstract&#10;    Unit Scale: individual aircraft, weapon systems, crew members, ammo rounds&#10;    Players: 1 (with option for 2 or more)&#10;    Solitaire: High&#10;    Playing Time: 2-3 hours&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to reach the opponents' 9 starting spaces with the snips of the same color (like in Salta). Movement is in knight-move forward and backwards on the grey and red spaces. Double moves are possible by jumping over friendly snips. If a snip has passed the red spaces into the opponents half of the game board, it can't return to its own half.&#10;&#10;Snip-Jagd (2-4 Players)&#10;Each player has 2 hunters, which start on the spaces marked with a &quot;J&quot; and a runner starting on the spaces marked with a &quot;L&quot;. The players have to move their runner around the game board till it reaches its starting space again. Movement is determined by 2 dice. When a runner moves through an enemy's circle, he risks being caught by the two enemy hunters, which can't leave the circle. A runner may be caught by other runners, too. A caught runner returns to his starting space to begin anew. If a runner manages to catch a hunter, the hunter is out of the game permanently. The first runner to reach his starting space, after completing the track around the game board, wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

In this card game, prepare to contain anomalous SCP items, sacrifice D-Class Personnel, play scientists and insurgents, and survive cataclysmic scenarios in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Unstable Unicorns and the Call of Cthulhu LCG, the overall gameplay of Uncontained is quite generic: you draw cards from the Draw pile, and do things with those cards. However, there's a twist: most cards don't really go to your hand and are immediately played on the board for everyone to see. Some cards would still go to your hand, and if they do, they should be able to give you an edge. There's also a dedicated Public pile that contains the Civilian cards which act as the game's general resource.&#10;&#10;Your goal Uncontained is to Contain as many Anomaly cards as possible. When an anomaly is drawn, it's by default Uncontained (placed in a special area called the Uncontained zone), and must be Contained during your turn through &quot;Sacrificing&quot; civilian cards. Each anomaly is unique and can either harm or benefit you, depending on its contained or uncontained status.&#10;&#10;The player with the most Contained anomaly cards when the draw pile runs out wins the game!

However, if the frequency is too unbalanced and players fail at rebalancing it, a blackout happens and all players lose immediately.

Unique to this set is the introduction of a &quot;link&quot; - a relationship between two formations that mitigates casualties. Some scenarios also allow players to shift unit sticks from one part of the battlefield to another. The six battles are Fleurus, Marsaglia, Chiari, Blenheim, Ramillies, and Denain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Our God Was My Shield is the first game in John Theissen's American Civil War Operational Series (ACWOS). This series of streamlined card-assisted operational sandboxes builds on Mr. Theissen's work in titles such as More Aggressive Attitudes, Objective Shreveport, and Hood's Last Gamble. Those games had slightly different and not entirely compatible rulesets - each one needed to be learned from scratch. But titles in the new ACWOS share a common core ruleset: learn one game, and you'll know how to play the rest of them. This ruleset is flexible enough to allow each game to have its own geographic and temporal scale and Combat Results Table, as well as special event cards unique to that campaign.&#10;&#10;Specific units and their strengths are hidden from your opponent as you perform a tense dance of cat-and-mouse maneuvers. When you attack your opponent, there's always a chance they might slip away - or, they might be able to concentrate additional forces, turning what you thought would be an easy victory into a near-run thing, especially if your own forces fail to coordinate. Knowing when to attack and when to hold back, when to run and when to make a stand, are paramount, and as ever, subject to the fortunes of war.&#10;&#10;The subject of our first title in this series is Jackson's famous 1862 Valley Campaign, which saw him eluding and harassing three Union armies through a combination of boldness and deception. It is perhaps an ideal subject with which to debut this system with its emphasis on maneuver, bluff, and nerve.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the time of construction in the early 1910s she was a capital ship (the last Japanese Capital ship to be built outside of Japan) and was among the most heavily armed ships in any Navy. She received two major reconstructions throughout her life, the first being in 1929, she was rebuilt as a battleship, then later in 1935, along with her sister vessels, her superstructure was completely rebuilt, resulting in an increased rate of knots that would allow her to keep pace with the developing carrier groups &ndash; thus reclassifying her a s a fast-battleship.&#10;&#10;Kong&#197;&#141;&rsquo;s World War II service history includes covering the Japanese amphibious landings in British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies in 1942, shortly before engaging American forces and Midway and during the Guadalcanal campaign. 1943 saw her almost entirely stationed in the Caroline Islands, only being deployed in response to aircraft carrier raids against Japanese Islands scattered across the Pacific. She was part of the Battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in 1944, successfully sinking enemy vessels in the latter. Her ultimate fate was at the hands of a US Submarine (USS Sealion) whilst crossing the Formosa Strait on 21 November 1944. She has the unfortunate distinction of being the sole Japanese battleship sunk by submarine in WW2.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Japanese had learnt many lessons prior to her construction and as such Zuikaku was considerably larger, better armed, and had a higher aircraft capacity than previous purpose-built Japanese Carriers. Setting sail in November 1941, her complement of aircraft included 18 Mitsubushi A6M fighters, 27 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 27 Nakajima B5n torpedo bombers.&#10;&#10;She was part of the task force whose aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and was a prominent participant in many subsequent battles in the Pacific Ocean &ndash; including, Java, Ceylon, the Coral Sea, the Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz, the Philippine Seas and Leyte Gulf. It was at this last action that she was sunk, at the Battle of Cape Engano on 25 October 1944.

Mikuma then participated in the Indian Ocean Raids, before being recalled for the Midway operation.

A succession of attempted airborne attacks, from B-17s to Vought SB2U Vindicators all failed. The next morning, however, SBD Dauntless dive bombers from USS Enterprise and Hornet managed to successfully inflict 5 bomb hits resulting in a cataclysmic chain reaction of explosions of the onboard AA shells and torpedoes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This soon changed after the attack on Pearl Harbor. She returned to the Atlantic and participated in shore bombardments including at Attu and Kiska, Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, the Mariana and Palau Islands Leyte, Luzon and Okinawa. She also performed escort duties, patrols and received refits during this period. USS New Mexico was subject to repeated kamikaze attacks during her WW2 service, which inflicted heavy damage and loss of life.

The Tanzimat reforms were an ambitious attempt on the part of liberally minded Ottoman sultans and politicians to modernize the aging empire and thereby keep it from disintegrating.&#10;&#10;Players in the game represent Ottoman court factions who enlist Statesmen to use their bonuses, enact Reforms and reduce the number of Troubles in the empire. They must keep an eye on three common resources: Finances, Army and Standing.

    "Description": "Great Minds is an easy party game where players must solve the puzzle to escape the mind maze.&#10;&#10;The mind maze grid board is laid out with 25 clue cards. Each of the clue cards is a different word. Players then take a set of mind cards numbered 1 to 5 and a 2 matching coloured mind tokens, these tokens represent them in the game. The mind maze board also contains a score tracker, and one of the player tokens is added to this tracker.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, there will be 25 cards on the mind maze board with different words. Each card has a grid reference letter and number attached to it. The center card of the mind maze grid (C3) is removed and becomes the first clue.&#10;&#10;Starting with the top row, player secretly select and play, face down, a numbered mind card relating to a word on the grip and the initial clue. Once all players have played a card, the card are all turned over and players place their mind token on their chosen word. Players get a point if they have successfully picked the same word as another player. The word(or words) with the most votes, becomes the clue for the next row. Once a row is complete, the words on that row are flipped over to reveal new words. Play continues down the mind grid, once player reach the bottom, they go back to the top of the grid, but now the words are different and there are less of them.&#10;&#10;When all words have been eliminated from the mind maze, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Also great as a travel game to take on holiday or when you're out with friends. It plays in 20-40 minutes for players aged 8+.  It's quick to learn but strategic, learn from your enemy and try to get inside their mind to work out what sequence they will lay their cards down.  Artwork by Adrian Stone.&#10;&#10;Recreating the largest airborne invasion in history, Operation Market Garden in World War 2.  Use your battle and tactic cards to out smart your opponent, use your equipment wisely, reveal events and monitor your divisions. Can you win enough battles to secure the vital bridges, will you be able to capture and hold all of them in time?&#10;&#10;Each round consists of 7 battles, to win a battle the player must have the highest points score. The player will combine, battle, tactic, equipment and event cards to get to their total score.  Whoever wins the most battles wins the bridge.  The Allied player must win the bridge to proceed to the next bridge a draw is not enough.  Players will take it in turns to be the Allied player to see how many bridges they can capture.  The German player can reduce the effectiveness of the Allied player by altering the Allied Division cards, the Allied player can try and counter this using the Victoria Cross card but these are limited so you must use them wisely.&#10;&#10;Events can be positive or negative for both sides.  Players must try and work out what sequence their opponent will lay down their cards.  They must remember what cards have already been used and try and get inside their opponents mind to out think them, what did they do last round, will they do the same thing, which combinations of cards do they favour, when should I use my Victoria Cross card.  There are only 3 equipment and 3 tactic cards for each side so they must be used carefully.  Can you get your opponent to use their most powerful card on your weakest card?&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Liege was the opening engagement of the First World War and the first step of the German Schlieffen Plan. Liege, a city protected by a ring of twelve forts, blocked the passage of the German First and Second Armies. It contained the railway bridges crossing the Meuse river that would be needed by the advancing armies. Winning a quick victory over the Belgians was critical to the success of the German plan so a surprise attack of six brigades was launched ahead of the heavy artillery that ultimately destroyed the forts.&#10;&#10;Liege 1914 is a regimental-level simulation of this opening battle of the Great War. Players assume the roles of the commanders of the German and Belgian troops as they desperately fight for this valuable position in the line.&#10;&#10;The 17 x 22&quot; map shows the western portion of Belgium from the German border to Liege. The 240 1/2&quot; counters (die-cut and back-printed) show German and Belgian forces involved in the battle.&#10;&#10;Liege 1914 is now the second installment in the Great War Battles series. Based on the Ypres 1914 game system (the first in the series), the Great War Battles is a series of games devoted to simulating battles of the First World War. Battles are covered at the brigade/regiment level using a common set of rules. Games in the series will cover a variety of situations ranging from trench warfare to open fighting.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts the game in one of six towns around Great Bay. Each town will have its own unique market of available and wanted goods, drawn from a deck of market cards. Players use their money to purchase goods from the markets for delivery to other towns in order to make a profit. Players can also pick up passengers who are looking for transport to other towns.&#10;&#10;After loading the goods and passengers onto their gundalow, players roll a die to sail to other towns around Great Bay and the Piscataqua River. The deepwater port of Portsmouth has exotic and highly-profitable goods available (such as spices and cotton) but it&rsquo;s a long journey down the Piscataqua River.&#10;&#10;Event cards come into play when players land on the event squares on the game board. Event cards offer new challenges and opportunities to players and will create dynamic and exciting market conditions. Players may need to adjust their trade routes to be successful! Resourcefulness and flexibility are the keys to successfully competing against the other gundalow captains.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player accumulates $100. Players then tally their goods and passengers delivered, and the players with the highest totals receive one or more of several honorary titles and victory cards. Will you earn the coveted &ldquo;Richest Captain&rdquo; honorary title (awarded to the player who accumulates the most money) or perhaps the gratifying &ldquo;Friend to Farmers&rdquo; honorary title (awarded to the player who delivers the most marsh hay). With a rich variety of goods, markets, and events, each game of Gundalow is unique, challenging, and rewarding. The game also comes with several suggested variants, which all combine to create a fun game with limitless variability.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
