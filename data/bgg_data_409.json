    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;The one thing that Down in Flames series players are always looking for is additional aircraft for their favorite game series. So we have decided to satisfy that desire with our first C3i-DiF Squadron aircraft pack. This pack consists of 64 fighter aircraft cards, printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years. Most of the aircraft cards are NEW aircraft types, although we have included a few reprints (with corrected ratings) of aircraft that have appeared previously in one or more of the DiF Series games.&#10;&#10;Included are such important aircraft as the British Typhoon and Tempest, the German Bf-109G-6/R6 and Fw-190F and the American P-63A Kingcobra (which was used extensively in combat by the Soviet air force). The pack also contains a number of more obscure but interesting aircraft, like the Rumanian IAR 80, the German TA-152H and the Polish PzL 24, the only fighter in the Greek inventory at the time of the Italian invasion in 1941. Speaking of the Italians, there are a number of Mussolini's fighters in the pack as well, including the Cr42 Falco, the M.C. 202 Folgore and the G.50bis Freccia. All of these planes are done in the upgraded graphic style of Corsairs and Hellcats, courtesy of Dave Lawrence, Martin Scott and Rodger MacGowan.&#10;&#10;The package is wrapped in a ziplock format with an 11&quot; x 17&quot; (folded) cover/rulesbook. The front cover is graced with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous DiF Series style artwork, while the inside will contain the rules necessary to use the aircraft in DiF dogfights. Some of the rules will be reprints from Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942 and Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who only own the European Theatre DiF series volumes (Rise of the Luftwaffe and Eighth Air Force). There will also be a few new rules. For example, ace researcher Chris Janiec has come up with a way of modeling aircraft carrying a single, large caliber cannon, such as the P-39.&#10;&#10;If this first C3i-DiF Squadron Pack proves to be popular, we're planning a series of these expansion packs. This is your chance to expand your Down in Flames series air force and add new aircraft cards at a very low price. Enjoy the games!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Clouds of Glory (ICOG)is a tabletop air wargame that recreates aerial combat during the World War One. The game was developed in Denmark the 90's by 3 friends with a common passion for the WWI &quot;Knights of the Air&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game features true 3-D action with accurate models of all the greatest planes of this era: SPADs, Sopwiths, Fokkers, Pfalz&acute;es, Nieuports, Hannovers, Rumplers, Albatrosses, Bristols, Gothas, Zeppelins, S.Es...&#10;&#10;The game represents individual plane movement and individual pilots. &#10;Each plane is represented by a 1/350 scale model with at 360 deg. nose mount that allows the model to be positioned in all directions. The nose mount is then itself mounted on a four foot long pole made of carbon fibre. The plan can then be moved up and down the pole, thus denoting actual height - No altitude markers here. The pole is sharpened and set directly into the foam gameboards. See pictures.&#10;&#10;Each plane also has a &quot;Cockpit&quot; sheet to which the Pilot sheet is attached and where the data (and possible special rules)on each plane type is represented. On the cockpit sheet also contains a speed indicator telling the current speed of the plane, and indicating the amount of energy the plane currently posses. This energy level tells how tigth the plane can turn and its ability to climb or dive. Going fast equals the ability to zoom high up, but turns are wide. Going slow allows for tighter turning but severely limits your ability to get out of trouble by zoom climbing and thus limits the tactical options. In this game speed is life.&#10;&#10;Piloting skill can make planes turn tigther than their speed normally allows for, but this drains speed and at higher speeds also stresses the airframe, thus creating a risk of breaking of important bits such as the wings.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Cockpit&quot; sheet is also where you record damage to the plane: Structural damage, damage to maneuverability, armament, engine and so on.&#10;&#10;Each pilot has a set of 3 basic skills: Awareness (situational awareness), Piloting (ability to make tight turns, avoid or recover from spins and stalls)  and Gunnery (hitting your target). A pilots skills are decided by rolling 2d6+6. Pilots also has 2 attributes: Fortitude (hit points and ability to figth when wounded) and Luck (Denotes number of dice re-rolls and Used to check for collisions) found by rolling 3d6. With experience pilots gain better skills as well as possible &quot;Ace abilities&quot; such as Divine luck, Deflection shooting, Aerobatics and so on.&#10;&#10;Skill and attribute checks are done with a d20 against a basic target number (for example Skill or Attribute level) modified by conditions (for example deflection angle or target speed). The difference between the target number needed and a the number rolled on a successful check denotes the success level which is then carried on as a modifier to the damage roll.&#10;&#10;The full rules including, missions and Cockpit panels and more can be downloaded for free here:http://icog.dk/ICOG/Download.html&#10;&#10;1/350 scale planes can be acquired as 3D prints(or hand build in styrene as you see on many of the pictures). A large selection of planes is available for the game. Links to these can be found on the ICOG homepage: http://icog.dk/ICOG/Links.html&#10;&#10;",

There are 23 separate Operations Plots displayed, each specifying the various ship settings for the forthcoming turn.&#10;&#10;The values specified in an Operations Plot include Offensive Power Level, Defensive Power Level, Shield Potential, Counter-Attack Factor, Defense Factor, Sensor Screen Penetration, and Rate of Warp (acceleration and deceleration). Each Operations Plot is given a descriptive name, ranging from the straightforward &quot;Full Shields&quot; and &quot;Total Offensive Weapons Deployment&quot;, to more convoluted selections such as &quot;Special High Speed Evasive Action Plan for 'A' Type Beta Battle Cruisers or 'CR' Type 'Gammas'.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game of the Second Boer War commencing October, 1899.&#10;&#10;Game comes in a small 9&quot; x 6 1/2&quot; x 7/8&quot; box with a cover illustration of a well-dressed Victorian family playing a map-and-pin flags boardgame of the war.&#10;&#10;The cardstock hex map measures 16 1/2&quot; x 11 5/8&quot; and depicts the region of conflict running from cape Town and Port Elizabeth in the south to Mateking in the west, the Rhodesian border in the north and the port of Lourenco Marques in the east.&#10;&#10;Map has one-inch hexes featuring Clear, Hill, Railway, River, and Mountain terrain plus economic centers and ports.  The mounted, pre-cut 3/4&quot; counters featuring forty green Boer Commandos of various strengths, Command Flags (three per player), two Natives, thirty-five &quot;Gold&quot; (Supplies), twenty red British Infantry brigades, twelve red British Cavalry brigades, and five red British Garrisons plus a Turn Marker.  Two D6 are also included.&#10;&#10;Unit counters feature, as appropriate, a drawing of a Boer horseman firing at the gallop, native shields, national flags, British lancer, British infantry, and a field gun with crew (for garrisons).  Counters include deployment location or turn of appearance, combat strength, and movement allowance.  Historical unit identifications are also included.&#10;&#10;Normal game length is fifteen turns (victory determined by holding the most economic production centers) or, optionally, thirty-six turns (pursuing the bittereinder to the last counter; if one survives to the end, the Boers win).&#10;&#10;Rules cover reinforcements, the British War Chest, Natives, Neutrals, Railways, Sea and Off-map Movement, Multi-hex combat, Sieges, and the assymetrical nature of opposing forces.&#10;&#10;Movement is handled in a distinctive way.  Each turn, Boer and British players alternate placing a &quot;flag&quot; on the map (numbered between One and Six).  After placement, players alternate moving units adjacent to these flags.  Units must stop if they move adjacent to a hostile unit.  Following this &quot;Consolidation Movement,&quot; Combat occurs.&#10;&#10;After Combat, surviving units may engage in &quot;Dispersal Movement,&quot; which is the opposite of Consolidation Movement.  Movement to and from flags takes place sequentially in the order of numbered flags.&#10;&#10;Optionally, players may place their flags simultaneously rather than sequentially; in this instance, players plot the hex number where each flag will be placed.  Another option allows for random flag draws from a cup.&#10;&#10;Combat is determined by odds ration and a singld D6 die roll.  The resulting number indicates the &quot;Butcher's Bill&quot; imposed upon either the S (smaller force) or L (larger force) engaged.  Losses are in units removed; the Boer player may retreat in lieu of taking losses if his units may retreat the full amount (one or two) and not move next to any British or native unit.  &quot;Gold&quot; (supplies) may not retreat and may be captured.&#10;&#10;",

Yellow action cards add excitement to the game by directing players to roll dice, find color chips in a bag or count out loud before discarding a card.&#10;&#10;This curious game relies on a coiled plastic tray that may be pressed down to become held in place by a sucker. The sucker holds the tray down for about 1.5 minutes (according to the makers) before suddenly releasing the tray, allowing it to pop up and scatter all cards that happened to be on it.&#10;&#10;Players try to play a card that is either a '1' or a number higher than the top card on the tray. The blue cards are numbered from 1 to 10, with lots more 1s than other numbers. The yellow cards are numbered from 1 to 9, but also have actions described on them that must be performed by the next player. The next player has to complete the actions before they are allowed to play their card. The actions could require players to count (for example, from &quot;Sproing 1&quot; to &quot;Sproing 10&quot;), roll a specific combination on two special dice (each die has 3 blank sides and 3 sides showing a coiled spring), or draw a chip of a specified color from an opaque bag.&#10;&#10;Anyone unfortunate enough to have the tray pop up during their turn has to keep all scattered cards, which count as points against the player who owns them. The player with the lowest number of points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Carlo Derby is a depression era horse racing game.  It comes in an orange and white tube with all the components rolled up in an oil cloth track.  The game contains a layout cloth, race tickets, ticket punch, five horse and a mixer called the &quot;carlo box&quot;.  The carlo box contains 6 white marbles, 5 red, 4 blue, 3 green and 1 black.&#10;As the marbles are dispensed, the horses advance. There are three raised felt circles below the track that receive marbles when you push the carlo box down.  The track has a fast and a muddy (slow) lane for each horse.  For example, the black horse fast track has only one space, which means he finishes the race the first time his marble comes up (1/19).  The black horse muddy track has two spaces.  You can bet on horses to win, place or show, and the payoff odds are shown on the track.  For example, black pays 8.5 to 1 for a win on the fast track or 24 to one for a win on the slow track.&#10;The best part of this game is the quality of the molded glass horses.  The tickets are also very realistic looking.&#10;The designer and publication date are unknown.  However, the game is described as patent pending, and the company address is 268 First Street in San Francisco.&#10;&#10;The &quot;carlo box&quot; could also be found (with the same marbles) in the game Lido&#10;&#10;",

(The die itself is pressure-sensitive, and will start timing when rolled.)&#10;&#10;Players must add letters or words to the existing word-pattern, as indicated by the die.  (For example, a die roll of &quot;+2&quot; means they must add two letters to the board, with the result being a still-legitimate crossword configuration.)&#10;&#10;A player can always, in lieu of rolling the die, select from a deck of cards that define a general type of thing (e.g. &quot;birds,&quot; &quot;sports,&quot; &quot;words beginning with 'R'&quot;) The player must add a word that meets the criterion of the card.&#10;&#10;Points are scored for number of letters in newly formed words, with standard Scrabble-like bonus spaces applying.  First player to set number of points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player gets a space-o-meter to record the number of millions of miles they have traveled on each leg of the journey.  Movement is governed by a spaceship spinner that advances from 10 to 90 million miles per turn.  To claim a planet, you have to be the first to have your mileage hit the orbit range of a planet.  For example, to claim Mercury, you have to hit the 100 to 130 million mile range.  If you go over, you have to reverse your direction and  start subtracting mileage for each spin.&#10;&#10;Once all planets are claimed, you add up the value of your planets.  These range from 10 billion dollars for Mercury's gold to 50 billion dollars for Saturn's plutonium.  These are very generous sums for 1951!&#10;&#10;This game has rich retro decco graphics.  The artwork is very similar to the 2005 Zathura: Adventure is Waiting.  In fact, the spaceships are nearly identical.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, you play one fuel card to move your ship that number of squares either horizontally or vertically, but not both.&#10;There are also two fuel ships.  Every player on his turn rolls a die and moves one of the fuel ships.  If you land next to a fuel ship, you can retrieve any one used fuel card.  When you are out of fuel, you can only move one square per turn. You also retrieve any 3 used fuel cards on every planet you land on.&#10;Each planet has a series of 10 to 12 dots that describe its entry/exit orbit.  To leave Earth, you have to follow the 12 orbit dots before you enter the vertical and horizontal grid of open space.  Likewise, when you want to land on a planet, you have to start on the outermost orbit dot and follow the orbit down to the planet's surface.  Sorry, no transporters in this game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player draws a card showing the order in which the cucumbers should pass the finishing line.&#10;In every turn each player picks two cards containing statements about the race's standings, e.g. &quot;The red cucumber is not ahead of the green cucumber.&quot; Now the player must choose one cucumber to move forward by one field or two, if he succeeds in making one of the two statements true and the other one false after his or her move.&#10;The player whose order of cucumbers matches the race's outcome best wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
