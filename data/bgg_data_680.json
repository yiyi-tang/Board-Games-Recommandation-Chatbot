    "Description": "Cycle Speedway was the fourth game in the Subbuteo racing series, which also included &quot;Table Speedway,&quot; &quot;Table Motor Racing,&quot; and &quot;Horse Racing.&quot; This particular game simulated bicycle racing.&#10;&#10;The game, like all in the series, is an action/dexterity game. The player propels their rider around a track by means using a ball bearing rolled down a small tube. The pieces were mounted to Subbuteo style bases, and represented cyclists. Although all games in the series used the same basic set of rules, there were variations to represent the various sports being simulated.&#10;&#10;According to Peter Upton, the variations between this game and &quot;Table Horse Racing&quot; were minimal, in fact, the rulebook refers back to the rules for &quot;Table Horse Racing&quot; as a source for variations.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Contains 110 cards... everything you need for 2 or 4 players to play anywhere using a single deck! It is fast, easy, fun and FULL OF DOOOOOM! Created by Artix and the team, this card game is fast, easy, crazy fun. Spend a little quality time away from the computer screen with the family, or duel your friends during lunch.&#10;&#10;Everyone starts with 20 Health. (Use 10 for a quick game!). Each player gets 7 cards. The deck goes face down between the players.&#10;&#10;On YOUR TURN...&#10;DRAW! - At the very start of your turn, discard as many cards as you want into the discard pile, then draw until you have 7 cards total in your hand. After you are done drawing, play as many cards as you want in any order! EQUIP ITEMS - Some cards, like Armors and Pets say, &ldquo;Equip on your turn&rdquo;. To equip a card, place it face up in front of you. Equipped cards remain in play until the end of the game unless your foe finds a way to remove it, or you choose to discard it during your turn. You can equip as many cards as you want on your turn, however, you can only have 1 Armor and 1 Pet equipped at the same time. If you equip a new one, the old one is discarded. ATTACK! During your turn you can make only 1 Weapon or Spell attack and also 1 Pet attack. Add as many enhancements as you want to any attack to increase damage! If you have armor equipped, check to see if it increases your attack&rsquo;s damage even more. Declare all of your attacks at the same time and when you are done, ask your opponent if they can defend against it. After everything is concluded, all cards used during the attack are discarded. (Except equipped Pets and Armors of course.) BLOCKED!? Use a Counter card to undo a block, trap or even another counter! There may be other creative ways to prevent them from stopping your attack too - read your cards carefully and exploit the rules! ANYTHING GOES! - During your turn you may play as many of your cards as you want. Cards will tell you when and how you can use them. Cards that say &ldquo;ANYTIME&rdquo; can be used, literally, at any time... even if it is not your turn... even if the card is still in your hand... and especially if it messes up something your opponent was trying to do! (Example: Stealing their pet with a trap card the moment they try to attack you with it. How rude!) END YOUR TURN - Say &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;, or something like that. This officially ends your turn and starts theirs!&#10;&#10;On THEIR TURN&hellip;&#10;MESS UP THEIR ATTACKS &amp; ACTIONS! Use blocks, traps and card special abilities to reduce or prevent damage. If something says &ldquo;ANYTIME&rdquo; you can literally use it at anytime. The most important rule of the game: The cards you play will change whatever just happened. (Example: If you get a chance to steal you foe&rsquo;s armor while they are trying to use its special ablility... go for it!)&#10;&#10;WIN!&#10;If you run out of cards, reshuffle the discard pile into the deck and continue taking turns until your opponent is reduced to 0 health and you win.&#10;&#10;",

So do not fear, young wizard apprentice, and delve into the dark depths of the &ldquo;Underworld&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). Is a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.&#10;&#10;",

Quite a profitable procedure in the 1950's as Sooty was a huge favourite on television.&#10;&#10;SOOTY&rsquo;S MAGIC CARD GAME&#10;&#10;The Pack&#10;Here is a brand new card game for 2, 3 or 4 players which you will find easy to learn and which will give you hours of fun at parties and at home in the evenings. Mummy and Daddy will enjoy it too and, after you&rsquo;ve played a few games and learnt some of Sooty&rsquo;s special tricks with his Oofle Dust and Magic Wand, they&rsquo;ll have a hard job to beat you at it.&#10;&#10;There are 54 cards in the pack and they are made up like this &ndash; &#10;    18 Sooty cards&#10;      1 Sooty Joker&#10;    18 Sweep cards&#10;      1 Sweep Joker&#10;      8 Oofle Dust Cards&#10;      8 Magic Wand cards&#10;&#10;As you can see, both the sets of Sooty and Sweep cards, which we call &ldquo;Suits&rdquo; as in other card games, have different numbers on them running from 1 to 5. In each of the two Suits there are six cards with the number &ldquo;3&rdquo; on them and three cards each with the numbers  &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;2&rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo;, &ldquo;5&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The Object of the Game&#10;Starting off with 8 cards in each player&rsquo;s hand the winner will be the one who can first lay down the complete TWO sets (four cards in each set) with the numbers in each set adding up to the magic number 12. Each set must have four cards of the same suit, so you can finish with one set of Sooty cards and one set of Sweep cards or two sets of Sooty or two sets of Sweep. Most of you will be able to work out quickly how many different ways there are of making 4 cards add up to 12 but in case you want to see, here are the eight combinations which will work &ndash; 3333, 3342, 3351, 4422, 4431, 5511, 5421 and 5322.&#10;The Oofle Dust cards are used to put on your opponent&rsquo;s cards as they are laid down one by one, and the cards that have been &ldquo;Oofled&rdquo; cannot be counted towards a set until they have been &ldquo;released&rdquo;. This is done by placing a Magic Wand  card on top of the Oofle Dust card. So you can see that &ldquo;Oofling&rdquo; other players cards and being &ldquo;Oofled&rdquo; yourself becomes an important part of the game.&#10;The Sooty and Sweep Joker cards can, of course, be used for any number 1 to 5 when they are laid down.&#10;&#10;The Rules of Play&#10;1.    Decide first of all on the dealer. He will shuffle the cards and then deal out to each player, &#10;including himself, 8 cards. The remainder of the pack is then placed in the centre of the table &#10;face downwards and the top card turned up and put at the side of the pack to start the &ldquo;discard pile&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;2.    The Dealer starts play, and he and each player in turn can do ANY ONE of the following &#10;things but not more than one at each turn :-&#10;&#10;a)   Start his first set of 4 cards by laying down face upwards in front of him a Sooty or Sweep&#10;       card.&#10;&#10;OR     b)   Oofle any other player by placing an Oofle Dust card face upwards on top of one of the &#10;      cards in another players unfinished set. This card should only half cover the suit card so &#10;      that everyone can see the number which has been blocked.&#10;&#10;OR    c)   Release any card of his own which has been Oofled, by placing a Magic Wand card on &#10;      top of the Oofle Dust card (again half covering it). This releases his suit cards, and he can &#10;     then go on completing his set. Remember, though, that you cannot go on completing &#10;     your  set so long as any one of the cards in it is still Oofled, and that you can only release &#10;     one card at a time.&#10;&#10;OR    d)    He can extract the Joker from a completed set, his own or another&rsquo;s by substituting for it &#10;       the card the Joker represents. Thus, if in his completed set a player uses the Sooty Joker &#10;       as a 2 card, and you have a Sooty 2 in your hand you may exchange the cards and &#10;       then use the Joker in your own set at any of your later turns.&#10; OR    e)  Pick up the top card of the discard pile or the top card of the pack AND then discard one &#10;     from his own hand. This will go face upwards on the discard pile. You will usually do this if &#10;     you cannot do any of the other moves already mentioned, or if the top card of the discard &#10;    pile is one which you particularly want.&#10;&#10;OR    f)  Pick up one card from one of his own unfinished sets. This should really happen only if &#10;    you find that you have by mistake put down three cards which already add up to 12 or &#10;    more, or if you can see that you cannot complete a set and therefore want to try a &#10;    different way.&#10;&#10;3.    If at your turn you do (a) (that is, lay down a card towards a set) or (d) (that is, exchange a &#10;card for a Joker), or (f) (that is pick up a card from your unfinished set), you do NOT pick up &#10;another card. But when you play an Oofle Dust or Magic Wand card you MUST also pick up a card from the pack or discard pile, after playing your cards.&#10;If you remember this you will always have the right number of cards in your hand. These will&#10;gradually go down from 8 to 1 and the winner will of course be the one who in completing his second set has no cards left in his hand.&#10;At any stage of the game the number of cards you have in your hand together with the suit &#10;cards (but not the Oofle Dust or Magic Wand cards) you have laid down will always add up to EIGHT.&#10;&#10;4.    You may build one set at a time or start booth sets at once but remember that only one card &#10;can be laid down at each turn.&#10;&#10;5.    A suit card can be Oofled more than once, but the second Oofling can only be done after the &#10;first Oofling has been cleared by a Magic Wand card. A player who has more than one card &#10;Oofled in an unfinished set cannot go on with this particular set set until all the Oofled cards &#10;have been released with Magic Wand cards. Once a set has been completed, NO card in it &#10;can be Oofled of double-oofled.&#10;&#10;A Few Hints on Play&#10;When the game commences you will all probably start building your own sets on the table. But when you see other players with 2, or more important, 3 cards laid down towards a set, you must use your Oofle Dust cards quickly to block them and hold them up. All the way through the game your choice of action is between trying to win quickly yourself and blocking the other players from doing the same.&#10;When the game has gone some way and there are a number of suit cards on the table try not to get into difficulties with your sets through shortage of particular suit cards. For example, if you have already started a Sooty with two &ldquo;5&rdquo;s, the last two cards in your set would have to be &ldquo;1&rdquo;. But, if you can already see on the table two Sooty &ldquo;1&rdquo; cards, that means that there is only one left. So unless you have, or can pick up a Joker, you would be wise to lift one of your &ldquo;5&rdquo;s (move (f)) and at your next turn lay down a card with a smaller number, thus giving you self a better chance to complete your set.&#10;&#10;",

In this game you must be first to create a line of five pieces.&#10;Each player starts with 20 discs in his own colour. Players alternate to place pieces on to the board. The game ends when any one player has a winning line. However, if no-one has a winning line after all 40 pieces are on the board, players must move one of their own pieces one square. If no-one wins after five such moves, it is a draw.&#10;The pieces are circular discs with a vacant centre and a winning player scores as many points as printed on the board, which can easily be seen throught the middle of the piece. Scores are pegged on a sort of cribbage board.&#10;Essentially a 2-player game, the rules suggests variants for more players, one of which is a Five Drive.

In your turn, you can take a card, exposed or not, the only rule being that you must replace the card taken with a like-card (a picture with a picture or a word with a word). Or you can take the top card from the picture deck or the word deck,The object is to win tricks of 2 or 3 cards. The set must contain at least one card from the objects and a like one from the words. There is a table at the back of the rules which players may consult to check their trick is legal. Any time you make a trick, say, with an apple and the word apple card, check to see if any other trick has been collected in that family, for example, another player has played a banana picture with a banana word card. In this eventuality, you may take the banana trick, giving you two tricks in the 'fruit' family. And, of course, if a player makes a trick from one family and the two other tricks of that family have already been won, the player playing the third trick may take both the other tricks. Scoring takes place after one player has the required number of tricks (the number required changes with the number of players).&#10;Another set collecting game is described, called Family Triplets, in which you need to collect tricks of three cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two players race counter-clockwise around a wooden board, trying to eliminate their opponent's pegs by landing on them. First player to eliminate all six of their opponent's pegs wins. Player's pegs start in a home section of the same color. A pair of dice are rolled to determine movement. Each die may be used to move two separate pegs, or they may be combined to move a single peg twice. A peg must land in either an empty space, or on an opponent's peg, eliminating it. A peg in its home section cannot be eliminated. A player is not allowed to land on his own pegs. If a player cannot move, the player must pass. Once either player is down to one peg, the home section is no longer safe. However, the final peg can only be eliminated by a 6 on a single die. If both players are down to one peg, then it is a race to see who can eliminate the other, or who can land in their own home section first.&#10;&#10;",

The theme of these chain links is card advantage: while Valyrian Steel gives you the ability to draw more cards, Brass Link discards cards from your opponent's deck and denies him resources. Here to Serve also features two new plots that boost your strategy, allowing your characters to attack and defend without kneeling during intrigue challenges and raising the claim on intrigue challenges you initiate. Here to Serve introduces a wealth of new deck-building possibilities, especially for decks that feature Maesters.&#10;&#10;",

Every player draws a card to determine their character and see their special abilities.&#10;&#10;The leader always gets to go first. &#10;The builder gets to play 2 garden cards in a row once per round, &#10;The Thinker gets to choose a different player's ability for the round. &#10;Lucky obtains an extra free award when she obtains 2 from gameplay. &#10;The Holyman can have a player discard their card rather than play it, once per round.&#10;&#10;Each round, a player is selected to be the treasure hunter. Their object is to obtain as much treasure as possible, by guiding the garden maze to the treasure points. The object of everyone else is to stop him/her from reaching the treasure by playing garden cards to dead-end them or throw them off course.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, treasure points are totalled up and the winner is the player with the most loot!&#10;&#10;",

The cards are made up of 3 or 4 coloured sections, and like dominoes they need to match the colour on the edges with the same colour on another card, until all cards are joined together.&#10;&#10;Each child takes turns to spin the arrow and according to the coloured section it stops on, moves Doodles to the next matching colour on the path and if you&rsquo;re lucky and land on a coloured square that has the bone symbol on, collects a bone too, with the winner being the one collecting most bones.&#10;&#10;",

Players collect cards as the game progresses which help eliminate potential spies from suspicion until a player is able to make a positive identification.  If a player reaches an incorrect conclusion about the spies in their area then they are eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;Contents are:&#10;1 playing board, 1 control spinner, 4 Spy Catcher (player) markers, 4 sets of information cards (potential spies) and 12 covering discs.

Most mechanics are based on the roll of a six-sided die.&#10;&#10;More than six settings have been published, including:&#10;&#10;    Sci Fi&#10;    Fantasy&#10;    WW2&#10;    Modern &#10;    American Civil War&#10;    Starship Combat&#10;&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website (www.15mm.co.uk): &#10;The Turn Sequence of the game follows a simple path of firstly the Initiative Phase where all players roll 1D6 and the highest roll wins the initiative for the turn (important later on!). Then the main part of the turn, the In Play Phase where all characters in the game are activated not by the side upon which they fight but by their Elan Rating. This means better troops and vehicles move and fight before poorer quality troops and vehicles and within each Elan banding from 6 to 1 activation begins with the initiative holding player. When activated each character can choose TWO actions, these include move, ranged fire, melee, hunker down, special action, unique action. The character may choose two different actions OR the same one twice with a modifier; very flexible in battle. Ranged fire and melee are based on opposed single D6 rolls with modifiers for troop type and weapon ratings. This super fast system results in targets being Killed, Struck or Winged by attacks. Killed removes them from play while the other two results negatively effect their further performance in the game. The hunker down action allows characters to take cover against attack while special actions cover those things detailed in the USE ME Advanced Rules and unique actions are created when needed for a scenario.&#10;&#10;",

The rules refer to a board, but a diagram on page 4 shows that it is very basic, essentially a square enclosing two diagonals. One diagonal is for the vehicles and the other for the pedestrians.&#10;&#10;Rules are included for four different games using the set. The first is a suit-following game. One player places one of the four vehicle or pedestrian cards on the appropriate space. Everyone else must either follow suit, pass, or play a Stop card on top of the pile. The next player must pass or play a Caution card on one of the other three spaces. Then a Go card must be played, and the player after the one placing go leads off the new suit in the location designated by the Caution/Go cards. The policeman card allows a player to stop the play in the current suit and immediately start a new suit in its proper location. The first player to empty his hand wins the round and each other player is penalized for the values of the cards still held. A game is four rounds, with lowest total points winning&#10;&#10;The rules do not specify a publication date, but the box has a &quot;Patent applied for 9963/38&quot;, which suggests a 1938 publication date. The clothes on the people in the illustrations scream the 30's. Also, Zebra Crossings were introduced to Britain in the 30's and this game may have been published to take advantage of the interest in such things. Indeed, the rule book notes that this was one of a series of &quot;Road Sense&quot; games being published as &quot;a splendid means of encouraging thought in road usage&quot;, adding that &quot;Police Chiefs, Local Authorities and Safety First Associations, etc., recommend this series of games.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

If the property landed on is already owned and unmortgaged, he must pay the owner a given rent, the price dependent on whether the property is part of a set or its level of development. If a player rolls doubles, he rolls again after completing his turn. Three sets of doubles in a row, however, land the player in stock exchange.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mutanter och Maskiner (&quot;Mutants and Machines&quot;) is an MMO (Modestly Multiplayer Offline) board game, developped for the Swedish game convention Lincon in 2011, heavily influenced by the game &quot;Marketeer&quot; (space-themed, designed with Eve Online in mind) from the convention Kattcon 2009 in Sweden.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the concept of &quot;a large player base (20-60 persons) that comes and goes&quot; and goes on for about 2-4 consequtive days with a maximum of about 8 players &quot;logged in&quot; at the same time. The game requires a game master who controls the game flow. (Due to the nature of the game being active at all times, there needs to be several game masters taking turns.)&#10;&#10;The game is played on a large game board map. Players create characters and move around on the map picking up tokens which allow them to draw cards that represent resources, foes to defeat, missions or certain events. Players form &quot;clans&quot; consisting of 2-4 players and roam around the board, pursuing missions, earning experience points, money and points for their clan. Clan points are rewarded for completing missions that advance the game. Clans with high points may build home bases around the board and earn other privilegies.&#10;&#10;Players can &quot;log out&quot; (leave the game) at any time. All cards the player has are saved. The player can come back at any time and re-enter the game by simply reclaiming his cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the convention or set time (2-4 days) is at an end, at which point the clan with the most points wins. The game may also end if players manage to fulfil any end-game requirement set up by the game master(s).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1862 - Port Republic (American Civil War in 3D)&#10;&#10;This is the final of the five battles in the Jackson Valley Campaign of 1862 and the ninth battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D.It sees a Confederate force under General Thomas J &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson launching an attack against the Union force that is under the command of General Erastus B Tyler. Tyler is under the command of General James Shields who unfortunately is still with the rest of his division that is strung out on a very boggy road to Luray.&#10;&#10;General Richard S Ewell&rsquo;s division has been ordered to support the attack, this leaves the Union General John C Fr&eacute;mont free to attempt to Tyler&rsquo;s aid. Fr&eacute;mont withdrew his division in the night having fought the battle of Cross Keys the previous day with Ewell.&#10;&#10;Port Republic initially has a time limit of 16 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their task objective.Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 2 to 3 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavor of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&#10;&#10;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&#10;&#10;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Organized Chaos is a fast, fun, and exciting game that pits you against your opponents with one simple objective: Don&rsquo;t run out of all your cards. However, don&rsquo;t be fooled by the simple objective! You will be tested in many ways, and perhaps if you make smart moves and think strategically then you will emerge victorious. Accomplishing the objective will be much harder than it seems, especially since you are racing against opponents that have every reason to prevent you from reaching your objective so that he or she may win the game. Think you are winning big time? Seconds later you are losing horribly. Got a strategy you think works every time? Not so much. Prepare for excitement and disappointment, structure and disarray, this is Organized Chaos!&#10;&#10;Everyone starts the game with one card in their hand. A token marks each players draw pile because it is very likely that one or more may end up face up at some point in the game. During a turn a player draws one card, giving them two in their hand. Each card has two sides, each with a different ability. The player may choose which card to play and which side of the card to invoke. Most cards have a side that is offensive and one that is defensive. For example, the most common type of card has Burn on one side and Refresh on the other. Burn allows you to choose an opponent and they must &quot;Burn&quot; or place the top X cards from their draw pile directly in their discard pile. Whereas, Refresh let's you take the top X cards from your discard pile on the bottom of your draw pile in any order.&#10;&#10;There are also special cards that let you do things like flip yours or an opponents draw pile face up so everyone sees what their next card will be, another that lets you switch your entire deck with one of your opponents. There are several other cards that do similarly things to turn the game upside down. Use them all to your advantage to force your opponents' to lose all their cards and you will be the last one standing!&#10;&#10;See our website for official rules updates or to purchase this and other Van Ryder Games.&#10;&#10;",

Each one of you has to build total, 5 buildings in the 3 different sectors of the board (Mainframe). The Mainframe is divided in the Grey, the Red and the Gold Sector. You have to build 2 Constructions in each sector and 1 in the Gold and last one. The Buildings come to your possession through the Architectonic Plans. Each Sector hides unique constructions but traps too as well as it offers a variety of choices.&#10;&#10;Your rival Architects won't allow you to reach the gold and they will use all the means of the game such as the Hazard Cards. Using them, can seriously damage your constructions. On the other hand, the Mainframe wouldn't let you exposed, to them. That's why it offers the Construction Assurances. Thanks to these cards you will be protected, however, up to a point. Still, your rivals can use the Grids, obstacles that they place on the Mainframe and specifically in the area where you build and can delay you a lot. Place your pawn on the Pavement (outer board), draw your Plans, buy raw materials, hire the necessary Groups of Workers, get the License of your Construction and start building. But be careful, if you cheat, then the Construction Inspector will lead you out of the Mainframe. Since you complete your building, you collect a standard payment as well as different bonuses matching the different board-combinations where the Mainframe offers to you.&#10;&#10;Maybe this game seems easy and known but Biruda offers innovative mechanisms where you will meet duing the play. To prove yourself among the other and be the Master Architect you have to move with caution. The Pavement around gives to all the chance to draw different card sets and these cards will be proved veru useful during your work. Still this game differs a lot thanks to its variations such the board pieces of the Mainframe where you can connect them in different ways and reform the whole city. Among the Hazards, there are Earthquake Cards and based on their effects you can change totally the game. The most important here is that even if a rival Architect has managed to reach the Gold Sector and you are far behind, well with a single move you can restore the balance and be the winner.&#10;&#10;THE MAINFRAME IS NOW OPEN!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Second Kharkov: Strike &amp; Counterstrike, May 1942 (2K for short) is a low-complexity, two-player wargame covering the second battle for that city fought during the early period of World War II&rsquo;s eastern front. The game begins with the Soviets on the all-out offensive, but its second half is dominated by a German counterattack.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s a historical scenario covering the battle as it was fought, plus a what-if scenario that allows players to explore the possibilities inherent in the all-out effort originally proposed to Stalin by Marshal Timoshenko. In it, the Soviet player begins the game with the historical force along with a total of 26 more rifle divisions and tank brigades: everything that was then in the Soviet strategic reserve. Of course, to win that scenario the Soviet player needs to accomplish a lot more than he does in the historical one (capture all three hexes of Kharkov).&#10;&#10;Each hex represents five miles (eight km) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents two days. Each unit of maneuver represents a division or brigade of roughly 2,000 to 14,000 men and 50 to 400 armored fighting vehicles.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: Soviet untried units, initial German unpreparedness, air interdiction, historical and alternative set ups, multi-step German units, sudden death victories, fog of war, German inter-army cooperation, close air support, Soviet armor doctrine, Soviet panic, and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I.    Soviet Player Turn&#10;&#10;A.    German Air Interdiction Placement Phase&#10;&#10;B.    Soviet Movement Phase&#10;&#10;C.

    "Description": "Minsk '44: East Front Battles, Volume II, covers the crucial exploitation phase of the great Soviet summer offensive against the German Army Group Center. Starting on 22 June, huge Soviet offensives pierced the thinly held German front in many places. Soviet reserves were introduced into the breaches, aiming deep into the German rear area to trap the German Fourth and Ninth Armies. The drive of Third Belorussian Front, spearheaded by Fifth Guards Tank Army and Eleventh Guards Army, was aimed at crossings over the Berezina River, and the transportation center of Minsk. The German Fourth army deployed an agglomeration of shattered units plus the fresh 5th Panzer Division to hold open the escape route through Minsk long enough for the rest of the broken front-line units to escape.&#10;&#10;A two-player (Soviet versus German) operational level game, with division as the primary maneuver unit, and also includes air units, untried units, blown bridge markers, and headquarters units. The colorful map features the area of the Third Belorussian Front during Operation Bagration, with each hex representing approximately 2 miles across, and includes such prominent locations as Berezina and the transportation center of Minsk.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the classic quad series rules&rsquo; mechanics and a retreat-emphasizing differential combat system to encourage encirclement tactics, so typical of Soviet armor strategy during World War II.&#10;&#10;The rules entail a variety of standard and unique rules, such as Railroad Movement, &ldquo;What if&rdquo; Optional Reinforcements, Blowing Bridges, Untried Units, and the full range of historical unit formations, such as 5th Guards Tank Army, and the 505th Heavy Armor unit, etc.&#10;&#10;Victory in the game is determined by the accumulation of VPs for control of important hexes, as well as evacuating friendly units.&#10;&#10;Originally published in World at War magazine #22, Feb-Mar 2012.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2.1 miles / 3.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (228 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Minsk '44 rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Hat is a game for a good big company that plays it all together. Players one after another try to explain, show by pantomime or draw any word and all the others do their best to understand it. A performing player and those who coped with guessing words get winning points. Sometimes it happens that you need to describe several words but the time is always limited. Moreover player can cut down his time or make his task harder by any other way to earn more points. Players take the word samples from the hat or something modeling it. They decide how to fill the hat choosing words themes, their difficulty or language. It&rsquo;s easily possible to come across with unknown words or you can compose the tasks by your own self.&#10;&#10;This parlor game has got its name after the game popular in many companies where you have to explain words written down at the sheets of paper that are put into a hat. The game mechanics is based on the popular russian games such as &ldquo;Associations&rdquo;, &ldquo;Crocodile&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stooping dog&rdquo;. Mostly well-known western board games of this genre are Activity and Alias. &#10;The Hat cards are the basis of the game &ndash; they describe the way of representing the word: to explain by words, to show or to draw it.&#10;&#10;Players draw cards with face up from The Hat pile by turn and define the way of the word explanation. Finally played words bring winning points marked at the card. Also cards recount the time for the performance. It&rsquo;s possible to reduce explanation time to increase points. In this case the time is fixed by a dice roll. &#10;There are also 3 other card types with extra explanation terms. You get more points if you succeed using these cards. For example, you can take a complication card &ldquo;draw a word with your left hand&rdquo; as an addition to a simple drawing task.&#10;&#10;The main trait of The Hat game is in the unlimited ways of using words. Only you decide what word should appear in the hat and what will be guessed by your company. Varieties are numerous because Russian dictionary contains 140 000 different words, and it&rsquo;s possible to play using any foreign language as well.&#10;&#10;The game box contains of several word sets that differ by difficulty. They are sealed so nobody will see them before the game begins. You need to cut the word sets into the hat without opening it.&#10;&#10;It also happens that players get tired of the word game after guessing the same words for several times. This will never happen with The Hat. Words from the basic sets suit only for the first play. New words can be downloaded from our web site or bought in the special boosters.&#10;&#10;",
