    "Description": "Luck Plus is a unique card and dice game of number matching.  This game is for 2 to 8 players, ages 7 and up.  It comes with 108 cards, 2 dice, and instructions.  The cards are divided out as follows:&#10;&#10;48 GO cards - 4 set, of Green cards 1 through 12&#10;22 STOP cards - 1 set of red cards 1 through 12.&#10;1 set of red cards 1 through 10.&#10;20 TRANSFER cards - 1 set of yellow cards 1 through 12.&#10;1 set of yellow cards 5 through 12.&#10;4 TRANSFER PLUS cards - 1 set of yellow cards 1 through 4.&#10;6 DOUBLES cards&#10;8 LUCK PLUS cards&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first player to eliminate all of your cards by matching cards and dice.  Each player is dealt 8 cards face up.  The remaining cards are stacked face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned face up and placed next to the draw pile to form the match pile.  Each player will then try to get rid of as many cards as possible by matching the numbers on the cards with the numbers on the dice they roll.  There&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that, but you&rsquo;ll have to see the rules to get the whole picture.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to capture three squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row which don&rsquo;t contain animals. However, if you make three in a row and at least one animal is in those cells, you lose! (Think of the members of an animal activist group getting angry at you for capturing the animals.) To win, you must strategically free the animals while going for three in a row.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

An unknown member of the team has been infected by an alien entity and will sabotage and infect the researchers as they try and build a satellite array to contact mission control. Will you survive? Are your friends infected by an alien entity? Can you contact mission control before its too late? Grab some friends and join the paranoia.&#10;&#10;Alien Entity is meant to be played multiple times. Players are passed cards face down to determine who is playing as a human or an alien. The humans win if the satellite array is built or the alien gets shot. The alien wins if it passes out infection cards to all of the humans. After each game ends, points are calculated and another game starts with a new random person as the Alien.&#10;&#10;Each player draws cards from a central pile and takes turns playing and passing cards. Choose wisely because you will only be able to play one card per turn and equipment such as body armor only lasts until your next turn.You may pass cards face down to other players to either help them or hurt their progress. If you are a human you may want to pass parts of the satellite array to another human. If you are an alien you can pass infection cards to other players to get them on your side.&#10;&#10;Games usually last between five and ten minutes. After each game points are given depending on the outcome of the game. The cards are then re-shuffled and a new alien player is secretly chosen. You can play until a player amasses 7 points or you can just play for fun indefinitely.&#10;&#10;",

While Eternas is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you thinking. Eternas is a four in a row style game in which the first player to place four bead of their color in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, wins the game. Conceived around the shape of the circle (the symbol for eternity) Eternas was designed for borderless play. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Eternas is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mau Mau Extreme takes the basics of Mau Mau &ndash; that is, playing cards from your hand to match the top card of the discard pile in order to empty your hand first &ndash; and turns up the challenge by introducing a buzzer and speed elements.&#10;&#10;The gist of the game remains the same as the original: Players receive a hand of seven cards from a deck of sixty, and one card is place face-up to start a discard pile. On a turn, the active player discards a card that matches either in number or color the card on top of the discard pile. If a player can't legally play, she must draw a card; if she can play this card, she may do so. Playing a +2 card forces the next player to draw two cards before playing as normal, while playing &quot;Aussetzen!&quot; skips the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;New gameplay elements in Mau Mau Extreme include an out-of-turn playing option. If you have a card in hand that matches the top card of the discard pile in both color and suit and you can buzz before the next player goes, you can play this duplicate card immediately. Four types of violet cards can be played on top of anything, and they either give you another turn immediately, force everyone to draw one card, force your left- and right-hand to race for the buzzer (with the slower player drawing a card as a penalty), or force everyone to race for the buzzer!&#10;&#10;Empty your hand first, and you win a chip. The first player to collect three chips wins the game.&#10;&#10;A variant for masochists or those who just like to buzz a lot has you paying attention to the back of the cards as well, as each back features 1-4 colored buttons that match the colors of the main suits. After a person draws a card, if one of the buttons on the newly revealed card matches the color of the top card on the discard pile, players must race to hit the buzzer, with the last player to do so drawing a penalty card.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;     Crazy Eights&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Based on these rumors, the two largest diamond jeweler corporations in the world each send an explorer team on site.&#10;&#10;Soon the teams realize that the jungle crawls with creatures such as crocodiles, snakes, pumas and jaguars &mdash; but the worst of all are the piranhas that infest the swampy jungle rivers. By now the teams cannot go back, so the only means of safely venturing further into the jungle is by building canopy walks to claim square by square of Valle Grande!&#10;&#10;Canopy Walk is a strategic tile-laying game in which two explorers compete by building the most efficient canopy walk over the valley by making the best use of the four types of regular tiles. Each type displays different canopy walks, or a canopy walk plus a connecting platform, or a canopy walk plus a dead end tree, or a dead end tree plus a connecting platform. Points are scored per square on a canopy walk (CW) by a player's color.&#10;&#10;",

So I envisioned one big map showing the planets orbiting around, then a bunch of little maps showing the players' satellites orbiting the different planets, trying to blow the other guy's satellites out of orbit so they can claim the natural resources of that planet for themselves.

There is also a smaller variety of action cards.&#10;&#10;Moreover the theme is completely new. Superbohaterowie in Polish language means Superheroes.&#10;&#10;Your goal in this game is to collect one of each of five superheroes in your city on the table. Players each have five slots available to them, and each slot can hold one card. On a turn, you draw a card from the deck then either play it in a row (if it's a superhero card) or use it (if it's an action).&#10;&#10;Each superhero outranks two other superheros, similar to rock/paper/scissors/Spock/lizard. You can play a superhero card you draw in any empty space or replace a weaker superhero with the new one; you can play in your row or an opponent's. A star superhero is wild and can represent any superhero you need; a giant spider card can replace any element and can be displaced only by a star superhero or an action card.&#10;&#10;The actions let you discard cards in play, move cards, swap them. There are no cards which let you to lose your turn or reverse the turn order (which are in the Eleminis). Play continues until someone collects one superhero of each type in his city.&#10;&#10;",

Each card then gives its power (numerical value 0-9) to each of the player's own pieces located in that exact column. On your turn, you can move one of your pieces into a neighboring space either straight or diagonally. Whenever a piece is moved into another space where the opponent's piece is already located, the pieces fight. In that case the attacking player reveals the card that controls the column where the attack originated, and the defender reveals the card of the column the piece is located. The high card wins, with the losing piece being removed from the board. The used cards are removed and replaced with new cards from each player's own shuffled deck.&#10;&#10;Two of the cards have special powers. When moving a piece in the column of a 0 card, you can scout a single card of your opponent, after which you discard the 0 card, and replace it with a new card. Whenever the piece in the column of a 1 card is defending against a stronger card, the piece evades the attack and the two pieces change places.&#10;&#10;",

Two outcomes are possible:&#10;&#10;If the active player&rsquo;s card is not higher than a challenger&rsquo;s card, hence falsely claiming to be richer, the active player lose against that challenger.&#10;&#10;If the active player&rsquo;s card is higher than the challenger&rsquo;s card, hence proofing his claim, the active player wins against that challenger.&#10;&#10;The winner of a challenge then take a random card from the loser&rsquo;s hand, placing it face-up on a separate Bonus pile as a compensation that will be scored at the end of the game as bonus Points. Additionally, if there is only one challenger, the winner of the challenge also take the loser&rsquo;s revealed card, placing it face-up on the Bonus pile.&#10;&#10;The active player might have mixed results in a challenge, winning against one challenger, but losing to another, which is completely normal. Resolve each result in clockwise player order starting from the active player.&#10;&#10;After a Challenge had completely resolved, discard all cards revealed this turn to their owner's Discard pile and the play then passes to the next player on the left of the Target player.&#10;&#10;End Game &amp; Scoring&#10;When an active player plays the last card from their hand, the game immediately ends and scoring begins.&#10;&#10;All Asset cards still held in hands scores as many Points as their listed face-value. Plus, count all the Coin symbols from other player&rsquo;s cards that you keep in your Bonus pile as bonus Points.&#10;&#10;The player with the biggest Points is the winner and become the new Bluffing Billionaire. In case of a tie, the player with more sum of Coin symbols wins. In case of further tie, all tied players share the victory or play again to determine the real winner!&#10;&#10;",

The center four squares have been merged into the Pond, which is the goal area. Players roll both dice on their turn with the goal of getting one&rsquo;s own frogs into the pond to win. The frogs may be stacked but an opponent whose frog rests on top of the stack can freeze a stack of two. An opponent can not freeze a stack of three.

If you draw a card, it might instruct you to move a particular car, or the car in last place, or to spin a car out; or it might make you a &quot;Sponsor&quot; of a car, meaning you could get prize money for a car other than your main car.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, once you have coins, you become a target (when you land on another player, you get their gold).&#10;Each player has five plastic 'blocker cubes' that he can place on empty spaces. These blocks stop everyone but that player from continuing along a particular path.&#10;Besides the spaces where gold is available, there are those one can land on to switch places with the player of your choice and spaces that allow you to take a blocker cube off the board, which basically means it's not over till it's over.&#10;The board's multiple paths give at least a few options on each turn, unless an opponent has blocked your way.&#10;And don't worry if somebody's nabbed your gold.

    "Description": "This game comes from Californian Products, a company that was founded in 1975 but has only recently, with Cranium, entered the toy and game market. New Amici has set as its goal to tune up people's often only limited knowledge of foreign languages, so that players can make new friends when on vacation abroad.&#10;&#10;Up to four teams / solo players in two different nationalities take part, independent of language knowledge or age. By virtue of three difficulty levels, played in parallel, even novices can stand a chance against advanced speakers and learn the basics of the language along the way. The game works in two directions: people that normally speak German, for example, but wish to learn English can play the English-German version with English speakers who wish to learn German. Both profit from each other. But even players who all have the same mother tongue can play. The correct pronunciation of words in foreign languages is no problem, as New Amici uses a unique phonetic system that doesn't require any advance knowledge. Unlike the dictionaries, the words are spelled using 'normal' alphabet letters instead of phonetic symbols.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to win cards over three rounds. This is accomplished by translating cards in both the mother tongue as well as the foreign language. Novices have to translate simple words, advanced players have to translate tougher cards. In addition to vocabulary know-how, New Amici also provides information about countries and peoples. In addition to words, sentences and idiomatic expressions, there are also cards with information about culture, business, as well as food and drink. The next rounds begins after seven cards have been won. The winner is the player who, in the finals, translates all of the played cards error-free.&#10;&#10;The game has sold over 42,000 copies in Norway. In Germany, it is being distributed through toy stores, department stores, as well as book stores. Thus far, four versions are available for the suggested retail price of 39.90 Euros: German-English, German-French, German-Spanish, German-Italian. A German-Norweigan version is already available in Norway and should be available in Germany soon.&#10;&#10;In The Netherlands it was also available in four versions: Dutch-English, French, Spanish and Italian. A Dutch-German version was made by Hueber Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KG.&#10;&#10;",

In the early 1990's, the rights to the game reverted to the original publisher for some reason, but the rights to the name Alfapet stayed with BRIO.&#10;&#10;BRIO had purchased Alga some 10 years before and had made them BRIO's board game arm, phasing out the old board game brand Joker who had been used for all the Scrabble-Alfapets over the year. So BRIO gave Alga the task to invent and publish a new letter-tile-laying game with the name Alfapet, while firstly  Spear&#039;s (one edition of Scrabble) and later their new owner Mattel, Inc. (all subsequent editions in Swedish) started publishing Scrabble in Sweden under its original name. It might be interesting to note that Joker's last Alfapet (of Scrabble type) and Spear's first was virtually identical to each other, save some names and logotypes.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;Joker&#039;s last edition of Scrabble&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;  &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;Spear&#039;s first and only edition&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9; &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;Alga&#039;s first edition of &quot;new&quot; Alfapet&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;The name Alfapet was much more known, so this game sold better (most people who had heard of &quot;Scrabble&quot; thought it to be the English version of &quot;Alfapet&quot;).&#10;&#10;To a large extent, Alfapet and Scrabble are very similar games. The boards look a bit different; in Alfapet, there are for instance squares that decrease the number of points you get for a word, and there are +4 and *4 squares. With special arrow tiles it is possible to make a turn in the middle of a word. With a stop tile, you are allowed to lay a word directly after another without actually using the letters from the original word. It is also legal to lay a word in parallel adjacent to an existing word, as long as all the words thus created the other way are legal.&#10;&#10;To celebrate Alga's 90th anniversary a special limited edition was released called Alfapet Limited Edition. The only known difference in this limited edition is that it has a new dark design.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Scrabble&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is popular in Europe. It is played with three dice and an number of tokens (&quot;fiches&quot;, usually 11 or 21) and it is not uncommon to find special porcelain boxes, marked with the dice numbers 4-2-1.&#10;&#10;Play is in two phases. &quot;Charge&quot; and &quot;D&eacute;charge&quot; (discharge).&#10;Charge phase : all players roll the dice once and only once, each. The biggest hand takes as many tokens as the value in points of his or her hand. This process is repeated until all tokens have been distributed (with the last hand taking has many tokens as are available). If a player has all tokens at the end of the charge, the game is finished (and he or she pays a round of drinks).&#10;Discharge phase : The player with the biggest number of tokens has the first roll and then clockwise. The first player of a round of rolls decide for one or two rerolls. A reroll meaning rerolling one, two or all dice, to try to achieve the best hand. By electing to have rerolls, he or she allows the same number of rerolls to the other players. The one who rolls the biggest hand gives a number of tokens equal to the value of his hand (or all of his tokens if not enough) to the player who rolled the lowest hand. That player becomes first player.&#10;The game ends when one player has all tokens. He's the loser of the game and pays the next round. If at some point a player has no tokens, play continues without him/her (&quot;saved&quot;).&#10;&#10;Hands rank as follows (from biggest to smallest):&#10;1. 421&#10;2. 3 aces (1-1-1)&#10;3. 2 aces-six (1-1-6)&#10;4. 3 six (6-6-6)&#10;5. 2 aces-five (1-1-5)&#10;6. 3 fives (5-5-5)&#10;7. 2 aces-four (1-1-4)&#10;8. 3 fours (4-4-4)&#10;9. 2 aces-three (1-1-3)&#10;10. 3 threes (3-3-3)&#10;11. 2 aces-two (1-1-2)&#10;12. 3 two (2-2-2)&#10;13. 6-5-4&#10;14. 5-4-3&#10;15. 4-3-2&#10;16. 3-2-1&#10;Others hands are by decreasing order of values the dice, from 665 to 221 (which is &quot;nenette&quot;). For info, the last value before 221 is 322.&#10;&#10;1-1-x are called &quot;fiches&quot;&#10;x-x-x are called &quot;baraques&quot;&#10;6-5-4 and the like are called &quot;tierces&quot;&#10;&#10;421 is worth 11 points (sometimes 10 or 8 in variants)&#10;111 is worth 7 points&#10;x-x-x is worth x points (except for 111, see above)&#10;1-1-x is also worth x points (except, again, for 111) The difference is that for x, 1-1-x&gt;x-x-x as explained in the order of hands above.&#10;Tierces are worth 2 and the rest is worth 1.&#10;&#10;",

The children of six of these Chelsea residents have reached adulthood and are looking to find partners and set up homes of their own. In order to help their children, their parents start buying houses, vans and cars. However, their children have strong colour preferences, and also like their houses and vehicles to be colour-coordinated.&#10;&#10;Each of the three to six players takes the role of one family, and aims to be the first to set up all their children for their adult life. This will involve repainting houses, repainting garages, buying and exchanging vans and cars, until your children are happily installed in their new homes.&#10;&#10;Chelsea is a simple, yet thought provoking game, which teaches children to plan a strategy and follow it through in order to succeed. Because it only has a small amount of luck, children are rewarded for good play, and thus encouraged to think about what they are doing. But most importantly, because Chelsea is a game which teaches, rather than a teaching aid disguised as a game, children will enjoy it, and play it again and again.&#10;&#10;[Note] The emphasis on children as the target audience for this game does it a serious a dis-service &amp; kills its appeal to a gamer. This is a fine light filler &amp; suitable for adults to enjoy.[/Note]&#10;&#10;",

It uses a variety of collectable spaceship miniatures; unlike Battlefleet Gothic, movement is more Blue Max style than miniatures style, each player simultaneously programming from any of 13 possible moves.  Before the game starts, the players also allocate their shields around the ship's periphery.  Combat is a simple affair, and the rules are very skimpy.&#10;&#10;Battlefleet Gothic was actually still called Space Fleet Gothic in 1998, one year before its release.&#10;&#10;",
