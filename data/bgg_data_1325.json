Fertile lands turned to sand, animals of the woods growing large and evil and the hearts of mankind being corrupted with power. Signs of this corruption manifest across the land in the form of black splotches. Could this be the work of Tulo Tulodon banished so long ago? Can he be stopped before it&rsquo;s too late?&#10;&#10;Grit is played over a series of games. There's no set path you absolutely need to take to reach the end, so your campaign length will vary. Will you try to explore every inch of the world or crash the end game? Save your progress after each game or a series of games and pick it up at a later time.&#10;&#10;Travel around a modular, hidden map as you meet the townsfolk and battle the evil of the land. You must end your game at a checkpoint or you will lose your progress and need to reset to your previous checkpoint.&#10;&#10;Locations and events are depicted by QR codes.  QR codes will link to 277 websites with interactions with townsfolk, enemies and the environment. There are standard codes you can access whenever, immediate codes that are forced interactions when they are revealed and dig sites where you spend a stamina to uncover hidden items.&#10;&#10;",

If both players roll the same number, remove one of the 3 coins from the game and roll again.

It's like in paradise&quot;, says the little caterpillar, who is always hungry and eats everything that gets in her way. It is only picky about color. Sometimes she wants to eat something red, sometimes something blue, then again she only likes green or yellow delicacies. And then she searches until she has found something in her favorite color. With every bite the caterpillar eats, it becomes longer and happier. It's the same in this game: in the beginning the little caterpillar is very tiny, actually it only consists of a head and a tail. But the more she eats, the bigger and longer she gets. A treat in a certain color must be found through the color die. The card then - turned around - results in another piece of belly. Who has the longest caterpillar in the end?&#10;&#10;",

Despite the nature of the  sadistic souls held within its walls, Saturn Hills has functioned largely without incident until Wolfgang Koch was  discovered in his room, hanging from the overhead light by a makeshift noose. The way Koch died seems particularly  strange given his history and the reason he was incarcerated at Saturn Hills in the first place. Koch, one of Saturn Hills&rsquo; most notorious inmates, was also known as The Judas Killer because he hanged each and every one of his victims and  left a handful of silver coins in the pockets of the deceased as he staged the suicide of Judas Iscariot over and over again. Silver coins, incidentally, were also found at the crime scene. Who had it out for The Judas Killer and what was their  motive for killing him?

A villain with his own moral code and twisted sense of justice, Nero doled out punishment on those he deemed guilty, mimicking his namesake, the Roman Emperor Nero, who was known for his cruel and unusual methods of torturing those who crossed him. No one had seen or heard from him until earlier today when you received a curious box from Nero, threatening the city of Hampstead with the release of a highly communicable airborne toxin that will likely kill thousands of innocent people if not contained. Nero, however, enjoys the thrill of the chase and the challenge of a worthy opponent. He has provided a series of puzzles that will allow you to pinpoint the location of the  toxin as well as the means to disable the bomb that will disseminate the chemical compound into the atmosphere. He  has allowed you and the other members of the Will Street Detective Agency 72 hours before the population of  Hampstead is wiped off of the map. Oh, and one more thing. Nero has given specific instructions not to contact the  police, the CDC, Homeland Security, or any formal law enforcement agency, threatening to detonate the bomb early if  his instructions aren&rsquo;t followed. This means your wits and detective skills are the only thing that stands between the  town of Hampstead and a bloody, brutal demise.

    "Description": "When The Amazing Silverstone died, his Last Will and Testament was a source of much controversy due to a personalized note he left with his lawyer. It read:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;To my dearest son, Peter. If you are reading this particular draft then it means my unknown nemesis murdered me. They will have gone to great lengths to cover their tracks, but I know the truth. In time, hopefully, you will too. There have been lots of unusual happenings at Silverstone Manor over the past few weeks. Some of them I could have chalked up to simple coincidence, but the sheer number of strange occurrences has cast a sinister cloud overhead that has been too overwhelming to ignore. Your reading of this will proves that I wasn&rsquo;t paranoid or crazy. I was right all along about the threat on my life. That brings me to your involvement in this cryptic business. In addition to my estate and the considerable wealth that goes with it, I am leaving you the contents of my safe which, I believe, contains the identity of the one who took my life. Over the course of my life I have made many enemies, both personally and professionally, and I believe one of these is to blame for my untimely demise. Determine the identity of my killer and bring them to justice. I have the utmost confidence in you, my son.&rdquo; &#10; Although he had acquired considerable sleight of hand skills from years of apprenticing under his father, Peter Silverstone had no idea where to start with the investigation of his father&rsquo;s murder. As a result, he has brought the contents of his father&rsquo;s safe to you at the Will Street Detective Agency and hired you to help solve the mystery surrounding the death of The Amazing Silverstone.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Rating &ndash; 6/10&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to make the most money you can from these games, as well as win the critical esteem of your peers: the much coveted game of the year award.&#10;&#10;In the first part of the game, players will draw three idea cards and play two of them into one of three different rows each turn. Each of these idea cards has a number and a suit and represents a particular theme (e.g. zombies), a mechanic (e.g dice combat) or component (e.g. sand timer). Each theme card bears a unique piece of box art inspired by classic games and each mechanic card features a brief but clear definition.&#10;&#10;Using a poker style ranking system, better combinations of ideas score more but each row must also be a higher rank than the one below it. If the players fail to achieve this, they go bust and make no money from their rows. Since the players can&rsquo;t move ideas cards between rows once placed, they must make careful choices about what combinations they attempt to make. To help them, they can also play up to one development card a turn. Each of these lets them directly manipulate their cards and break game rules to make the most money and win the first part.&#10;&#10;In the second part, players may pitch one of their rows as a game to the other players. It must have a title and include all four idea cards in the row in some way into its description. Players will then vote on the game they liked the best and the game with the most votes wins the game of the year award, and the second part of the game. To have the best chance at winning overall, players must weigh-up their investment in maximizing the score of their rows vs how useful they will be for their pitch, if they choose to make one.&#10;&#10;",

Your job is to drive tourists across the savannah where they may take photos of animals.&#10;&#10;The Mara consists of face down tiles where only the habitat color is known, not the animal symbol. The players take turns to either pick up/drop off tourist cards at lodges or to drive their jeeps and peek at adjacent tiles. The more tourists they have, the less drive actions can they take.&#10;&#10;If both color and symbol matches a tourist on picked up card, the player takes a photo by placing a gem on the tourist.&#10;&#10;Each tourist has a favourite animal and each animal has its favourite habitat. When all the tourists have been picked up or all the animals have been photographed, the game ends and the player with the most complete sets of animal photos wins.&#10;&#10;The Mara combines child-friendly mechanics like deduction, memory and pick-up and delivery with a healthy dose of randomness to provide a fun experience for the entire family. Animal cards tell you where on the map the animals are likely to be found, memorizing the animals you pass help you find them for the next tourist, and skilful jeep driving let you deliver as many tourists to the animals as possible.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

An important aspect of this is that all product selections and displays must be based on customer preferences, and every producer and distributor must be handled the same way.&#10;&#10;The items of the store come in three different types of five different colors. The players play job cards to order items to the store, move them to the shelves, pick up customer cards and match them with items on the shelves.&#10;&#10;Timely actions will let you work where the store needs it the most and skilful placement of items will bring &rdquo;your&rdquo; customers&rsquo; items to the shelves first - both of which will earn you satisfied customers.&#10;&#10;The better you execute the jobs, the higher the Customer Satisfaction Index increases. When the store closes, the player with the highest index wins.&#10;&#10;The Shelf is a kind of semi-cooperative experience where an action of one player will open (or close) opportunities for the next player. The physical movements of items through the store provides both a tactical experience and a spatial challenge and the card management provide elements of both deck building and turn order manipulation. The result is a highly interactive and tactical game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gustav Vasa has liberated the Swedes from the Danish oppression and risen to the throne. But the new King&rsquo;s position is weak, as is his Kingdom. Sweden is indebted to the Hansaetic League, Denmark has not given up her claim to the Swedish crown and Europe suffers from religious turmoil.&#10;&#10;But this is also an opportunity to start something new. By developing the economy, reforming the taxation and building a national army, Gustav Vasa sets out to consolidate his dynasty and his Kingdom. Take advantage of natural resources, encourage domestic manufacturing, establish overseas markets and engage in profitable wars to pursue the King's will. This is only the foundation of a strong and powerful nation!&#10;&#10;Take turns to add estate cards to a card tableau.

As more advanced resources enter the economy, they can be invested in advanced farms and shops that enable the production of advanced resources within the Kingdom. However, such actions also require a combination of two similar estate cards in the same column so plan your card tableau wisely.&#10;&#10;The players who has supplied the most resources to the Royal Missions wins.&#10;&#10;",

It's a game system using simple programmable &quot;joystick cards&quot; and generic boards to recreate old C64 games.&#10;&#10;Among the games included in the base pack are Tanks (move tanks and fire bouncing shots at opponents), Monsters (move hero and monster with the same action), Maze (find your way through a maze with movable walls), Cars (use gears and turns to race and bump your opponents, Trains (move trains and lay tracks to connect to as many opponent rails as possible), and Snakes (move snakes and try to eat your opponents).&#10;&#10;The board consists of 8x8 squares, possibly with additional components depending on the game. Each player has a card tableau of 3x3 joystick cards. The player starts with any 2 cards from any row or column as active joystick cards and play them one at the time to either move in a direction or press a button. The last played card determines the row or column to take up the next 2 cards from. The game proceeds in this manner until its victory condition has been fulfilled.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Somewhere in Belgium the truth machine seems to be rusting away. Where science forgets who it was and logic calculates that it cannot do everything. You don&rsquo;t know who trust, but cooperation is going to be essential in order to tie the events down and crystallize a coherence for this spreading caos. And of course you are the only person who knows the truth behind the &quot;SCP - db&quot;, the Standbeelden.&#10;&#10;The SCP Foundation is a fictional international organization that contains and classificates anomalities outside bounds of natural law to prevent mass panic. But, what happens before these events are classified and somehow enprisoned? What if those were free?&#10;&#10;This is a game based on the contemporary era and involves suburb investigation on paranormal events along a fractional surrealism. The players get bits and pieces of what&rsquo;s going on and tie them together, giving different endings to it depending on the interpretations of their character's point of view. The objective is to propose the most coherent scenario in a convincing storyline.&#10;&#10;The game starts by dealing Character and Object cards that remain hidden. Then a keyframe card is revealed, this one contains a mysterious image and narrative fragment. All the players pose their questions around it and then take turns to answer them with a small story in order do build coherence. A vote round will determine which storyline wins, staying as the real version of the occurred events. The corresponding player's character then becomes the protagonist who will then explain what the &quot;SCP - db (Standbeelden)&quot; turns out to be. The losers will give an outcome to their character taking into account what the protagonist, the antagonist, the narration, the secondary characters and the items are.&#10;&#10;It is better consider this game not as a zero sum game but as a narrative game-tool. An open ended game in which players can also write their own keyframes and subsequently play as many keyframes as they want. Any doubt about the game is to be determined by the people involved.&#10;&#10;This game's setting underlines the human ability to cooperate and piece together non-linear narratives in search of further, more rhythmic patterns. Through overinterpretation, eldritchness and speculation. It puts into consideration the next questions: &ldquo;What is that which we do not acknowledge as a whole?&rdquo; And &ldquo;Why does it necessarily and so often have to do with streams of massive delusion?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Rolling gives players a chance to reposition with the grappling hook (1/2 chance) or push all players in a direction of their choice with wind (1/6 chance). Players must perform all three actions once in any order to end their turn and may also use their powers as optional actions.

Word game which contains 10 levels. Age 11 - 99 &#10;     Pairs. A memory recall game. Age 10+&#10;     Snap. Popular, fast-paced card game. Age 9+&#10;&#10;&#10;MaxxRas: Players begin at level 1 and build/create/form 3 or 4 letter words and progress to level 10 and build/create/form 15 or more letter words. MaxxRas is simple to begin and then through the levels becomes one of the most challenging word games in the world. There is lots of room for progression as it gets harder each time more letters are needed to make a word. MaxxRas is probably the only word game in the world that allows the players the opportunity of building/creating/forming a 45 letter word &ndash; &ldquo;pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis&rdquo; whilst playing Level 10. MaxxRas is for the word game fans in the family and for the players that like being challenged. It&rsquo;s an ideal travel game.&#10;&#10;Deal 7 random cards to each player. Place 3 or 4 cards face-up randomly and then place level 1 card next to the cards in the Centre play area.&#10;Level 1 is to create 3 or 4 letter words. Take turns to build a word by using at least 1 alphabet letter from 1 of your own cards and using letters from the other cards in the Centre play area. Once a player has created a word, place the card separately from the other cards in the Centre play area and then reveal/confirm the word to the other players to avoid picking up an additional card from the deck. Then place that card on top of any card in the Centre play area.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of their cards outright wins that level. The player that wins the most number of levels is the MaxxRas winner.&#10;Full details and videos on how to play MaxxRas word game in minutes is available on the MaxxRas YouTube Channel.&#10;&#10;Game 2&#10;Pairs.

    "Description": "Rollway Station 2 is a print and play train game inspired by the 18xx series of games. You take on the role of an investor in various train companies trying to make the most money over fifteen turns. You'll roll dice and assign them to three different actions as you invest in companies, auction off trains, and build track to develop your train network. In this sequel, you're also competing with a Rival who will buy shares and make investments to compete with your score. Can you earn more points than the Rival?&#10;&#10;Each turn of Rollway Station 2, you roll 6 dice. You must then assign these dice to three different actions: buying a share in a company, laying track, and bidding on a train. The values of the dice determine the specific effect of each action, and you'll rarely get everything you want. After you've taken your turn, there will be one die left over which is used by the Rival, who will either compete with you for shares in valuable companies, or make their own investments in private companies. Every few rounds, all the trains run and you score points based on how good their routes are, but so does the Rival. No experience of Rollway Station is required to play and enjoy this game, it's totally standalone.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You've managed to pull off the Heist of the Century. A fortune in gems, gold, paintings and more sit before you and your crew. The only question is how to divide the loot? The Boss suggests one final card game before you go your separate ways. It's time for... The Split.&#10;&#10;Based on a modified version of the classic card game Blackjack, players will try to bluff and outwit each other to claim piles of loot cards. Collect cards and get your total value as close to 21 as possible - closest gets first pick of the stacks. Use your Bonus cards to manipulate your total, but don't play too safe... with one fewer stack on the table than there are players, you're never guaranteed a prize.&#10;&#10;Each round sees one player act as the dealer, passing regular playing cards out to all players. Your initial aim is to score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding that number - special one-use Bonus cards can help you get closer to the target. Only players with the highest value scores can claim from the stacks of Loot Cards, containing different items such as gold, gems, valuable paintings and more. More loot is added each round, and the game continues until the Loot Deck is depleted. Each loot type scores in a different way, and the player with the most Loot at the end of the game will win. Play with the Disguise cards for a trickier version of the game, where you can't win without a way to escape!&#10;&#10;With various difficulty modes, The Split offers an interactive, easy to learn experience that will appeal to a wide range of players. So, settle in, keep a straight face, and see how much you can walk away from the table with.&#10;&#10;",
