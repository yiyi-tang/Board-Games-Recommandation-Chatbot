The game can be considered semi-cooperative but it is still a race to be the first to land on the moon. The SovietMoon deck provides an AI opponent that is challenging and difficult to beat. Players may find opportunities to cooperate for overall success, but superior game-play and completion of multiple missions in a single turn will benefit players the most.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Of course, when you took the job, no one warned you about the upcoming monsoon season&hellip;&#10;&#10;You will need to purchase and place various haunted hayride attractions on Hank&rsquo;s property. Then you will draw the path for the tractor to pull guests around in the hopes of delightfully scaring them. Unfortunately, while you are planning your tractor route, the yearly monsoon hits, and you will need to contend with ever-growing flooded areas of the farm. Not only that, but you have to contend with Marcie&rsquo;s Teenage Troublemakers on the night of the hayride, who love to egg the guests as they ride by.&#10;&#10;Haunted Hayride is a roll-and-write where all you need is a few dice and pencil. In stage one, you are placing your attractions on the map. In stage two, you are drawing a path that you will take your guests on to visit those attractions while your property slowly floods.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On a hexed isle far across a shining sea, wizards duel for magical supremacy and the fate of the island itself.&#10;&#10;Mystery Wizard is a game for 2 to 6 players that takes around an hour to play, starring 8 unique spellcasting characters, each providing a radically different strategic experience. When each player chooses a wizard, they are selecting a totally unique set of spells and abilities which will flavor their strategic choices and paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Each wizard begins the game in their village, in a corner of the hexagonal board. In the center of the board is a tower filled with ancient secrets. The objective of the game is to loot the tower and return two of its Mysteries home to your village. However, Mysteries are scarce, and in order to secure your own, you&rsquo;ll need to take them from someone else. Fierce opposition from rival wizards will take the form of fireballs, cyclones, wild animals, lightning bolts and more, leading to a chaotic capture-the-flag brawl where alliances can form or dissolve in the blink of an eye.&#10;&#10;Players must also navigate the effects of villainous priests, friendly goblins, burning desert sands, civil war, and more. A dynamic and engaging quest system brings the hexed isle to life with events and monsters, and provides a way for wizards to earn enchanted gear and powerful spells by seeking out lost temples and buried treasure. However, a creeping madness threatens to corrupt the land if the wizards do not move fast enough. The tension and difficulty slowly increase throughout game and lead to an end game characterized by knife&rsquo;s edge decision, where making one wrong move could spell doom.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You will evaluate the chosen Special card(s), instead of the chosen original card(s) (but the other players still can use the original objectives).&#10;&#10;This way you will score the same number of objectives as usual, but you will have the option to choose a Special objective card - which maybe better fits your christmas tree - instead of one of the original objectives.&#10;&#10;",

If you have flipped Bone, however, you must return a set you have collected to the playfield.&#10;&#10;It is recommended to read the tile name each time a tile is flipped so that the game gets heated.&#10;&#10;You win the game if you have collected the most TEBASAKI among players.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#229;&#143;&#164;&#229;&#177;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#190;&#189;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#229;&#148;&#144;&#230;&#143;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#159;24&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#133;&#173;&#232;&#167;&#146;&#229;&#189;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;3&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#190;&#189;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#136;chicken)&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#141;(beer)&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#141;(towel)&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#163;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#155;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#173;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#136;born)&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;1&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#191;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#183;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#229;&#134;&#141;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

They have survived many times of extinction events and following changes of ecosystem by evolving into various forms. Though having survived through Cambrian, Ordovician, Devonian periods, they are eradicated in the End-Permian extinction.&#10;&#10;Mass Extinction is a game with a theme of survival and evolution of trilobites. They will be rewarded each time they survive a catastrophic event. Even death of an individual might trigger an evolution for the species.&#10;&#10;With the doomed future ahead, which species will enjoy the most prosperous

Spread four cards in front of you. If you think you need one of these cards to make a correct shichimi, place the card to your blend pile, then refill the space in front of you. The correct shichimi is: any number of chili pepper cards and six cards of different types, but never include habanero or the whole shitimi is spoiled.&#10;&#10;Players race to make their shitimi, and the first player who has made a correct shitimi is the winner.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#131;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#229;&#148;&#144;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#231;&#167;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#148;&#144;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#151;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#166;&#153;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#230;&#150;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#166;&#153;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#230;&#150;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#228;&#184;&#131;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#229;&#148;&#144;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#166;&#153;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#230;&#150;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#228;&#184;&#131;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#229;&#148;&#144;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#10;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#148;&#144;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#230;&#143;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#131;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#229;&#148;&#144;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

Each section has holes for 5 colored pegs as the same color as the quarter section.  Each player decides which color they want to play and then takes the 5 pegs of their color.  Each player, in turn, spins the dial.  There is an arrow in the corner of the box.  Whichever color the arrow is pointing at when the dial stops, the player of that color gets to put one of their pegs in one of the holes of that color, regardless of which player spun the dial.&#10;Winner is the first person who has succeeded in getting all 5 of their pegs into their colored area.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Interference! is a game in which two players attempt to save the world from utter destruction.&#10;&#10;You are the operators of a missile control mainframe and due to a slight human error, the total annihilation of the world is looming! The systems have locked you out and you can only rely on your hacking skills to regain control.&#10;&#10;The mainframe's lock is represented by four double-sided cards that are shared between the two players. Both players hold a hand of secret action cards as well as a card showing a secret target sequence.&#10;&#10;Using their action cards, the players struggle to change the lock sequence into their target sequence. This will break a layer of the mainframe's security system and help the players regain control.&#10;&#10;Will the two players prevail and save the world or should we all seek immediate shelter? The fate of the world is in your hands!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Severe drought, hurricane after hurricane and yet another super hero movie that no one asked for are just some of the plagues the world has had to live through. In Prima Materia, the players struggle to align the elements in an effort to make all things good again.&#10;&#10;The elements are represented by sixteen double-sided cards showing one of the four classical elements on each side. These cards are arranged in a grid of four by four cards. Each player holds a secret hand of action cards as well as a card with a secret target sequence. The players use their action cards to change the elemental cards and gain points for each sequence they manage to form.&#10;&#10;Will the elements realign and introduce stability in the world?

The gig economy allows you to get all of the drawbacks and none of the benefits while struggling to make ends meet.&#10;&#10;In Home Delivery, the players take on work as traveling popsicle sellers. The players take turns placing rectangular city tiles forming the road network of the city. In some parts of the city, there lives popsicle-craving residents with very specific tastes. They will gladly purchase a popsicle but it will have to be of the correct flavor.&#10;&#10;Each player can take on tasks from the local ice cream parlors, delivering a set of popsicles to the residents. For every task that a player completes, they are awarded with a small paycheck. The players may save their paychecks to pay for things like rent and food or may use their pay to gain a competitive advantage over their fellow popsicle sellers.&#10;&#10;Have you ever dreamt of owning your very own ice cream truck? Well forget about that. You're part of generation rent and this is the gig economy so all you can afford is to rent one and hope that your investment pays off!&#10;&#10;So what are you waiting for? Quit your day job and become part of the new economy. It's gonna be huge.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
