    "Description": "A chess variant with four armies advancing into the board from four directions, but with adjacent pairs of armies allied. Thus White has a so-called &quot;round front&quot; and a &quot;square front&quot;, advancing north and west respectively, while Black has a &quot;round front&quot; and a &quot;square front&quot; advancing south and east.&#10;&#10;All four armies take turns to play, so each player on their turn first makes a move with one of their square-front pieces, then with one of their round-front pieces.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture both enemy kings. When one king is captured, the other pieces of the corresponding army disappear, so the player can play on but with only half their pieces.&#10;&#10;From 2007 through 2010 the game was promoted through a website at playfrontiers.com.&#10;&#10;",

Deploy Soldier cards to the Field to reduce the cards in your hand. The last player to use up the cards in their hand wins.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;In a turn, you either play a card to the field (if possible), or retreat and pick up all cards.&#10;&#10;&#230;&#132;&#154;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#156;&#146; (Gusya no Sono) is Fool`s Field, a two player card game of hand managment.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 6 cards at the beginning, and the rest forms the draw deck. Then, players do multiple battles. For each battle, players play cards to the 3x3 battlefield by matching the cards' icons. If you can't play legally, or wish not to play, you have to call a 'retreat' and lose the battle.&#10;&#10;If you lose the battle, you must take all the played cards in your hand, and discard down to the hand size of 6 cards. If you win the battle, you draw from the deck up to 6, unless the deck is exhausted; then you won't draw further.&#10;&#10;Then start the next battle, with the previous winner placing the first card from their hand to the center of the battlefield as the lead. Continue battle until one player has got rid of their cards. That player wins the game.&#10;&#10;The cards have 3 kinds of icons on the 4 sides of the card: sword / shield / flower. When playing a card, a sword icon must be matched against another sword icon. A shield must be matched to a flower, and flower against a shield.&#10;&#10;Since the battle loser must draw back their played cards, players build up partial information but with discards, there are still unknowns. At the start of the game, players can manage their hand from their draw deck.

The object of the game is to get rid of your hand faster than your opponent. On your turn, you play your cards to the battlefield to reduce your hand. Play wisely, and when you make your opponent short of legal plays, opponent is forced to claim all the cards played to the battlefield. Keep your eyes on your hand and remaining deck, plan ahead, time your moves, and construct your hand!&#10;&#10;",

If you escape, you get a point. If the monster catches you, or the monster walks to the end of its path: you fail. Get 2 points for victory in the game, or fail 3 times and you lose.&#10;&#10;The monster is determined randomly at the beginning of a round. The game has a small booklet, showing the monsters and their paths. The monster's movement depends on the monster's type, different monsters move differently. Although the monster has predetermined 'movement path', when the player is in close range of the monster, it ignores the path and starts to chase, until the player gets out of sight of the monster.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of the following phases: monster moves (2 steps), player moves (2 steps), player searches (1 tile). Monster moves are mandatory, the player's moves or searches are optional.&#10;&#10;On the monsters turn, when in close range, monster moves to chase the player. Or else, it follows the predetermined path.&#10;&#10;On the player's turn, first, you may move up to 2 tiles. Then, you may do a search. To search, you draw a tile from a face-down shuffled pile of tiles. If the tile drawn may be legally connected to the tile you are standing on, you may place that tile. It is legal when: the tile colors are the same or the number is greater than the tile you are on.&#10;&#10;If you fail to connect, the tile drawn must be placed on a 'memory area'. In further turns, you may draw a tile from this area instead of drawing from the pile. But this area has a max capacity of 5, whenever you placed the 6th tile, it spills. You must then place all the 'memory tiles' back in the pile, face-down, and shuffle them.&#10;&#10;You start from the bottom-right tile. You escape if you successfully reach the top-left tile.

Think about 17(21) as a &quot;divertissement du Roi&quot; where the game of &quot;21&quot; gives an abstraction to play and pass those boring days at Kings's Court, waiting for news from the Danube or Low Countries campaigns.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game: players will have to battle each other with an &quot;age of reason&quot; army, to win the battle controlling more ground than the opponent at the end of the day of battle.&#10;The players must achieve this through proper use of terrain and military doctrines.&#10;&#10;How the game is won or lost: At the end of the day of battle, the players will have to check how much control their army has on the field of battle. The battle might ends in a draw, or in a minor or major victory. So the players will have to control areas of the battlefiled with relevant units to have a good ground control and so to be declared as the winner of the day.&#10;&#10;What pleyers do in their turn: Each player will first draft an army, then each player will decide how to implement the philosophy of his army through another draft of doctrine cards. &#10;In each battle turn the player will choose to move his units to cover empty spaces in the battlefield, to send orders activating a proper army doctrine (for example the oblique order) or to order units to attack enemy units in the battlefield.&#10;Combat will be resolved without dice, the game of &quot;21&quot; will be used (the so called black jack)&#10;&#10;In the end 17(21) would like to be a portable wargame to let the players experience a &quot;miniatures wargame&quot; in the mood it might be played at Kings' Court in the Age of Reason.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fallout: Adventures is a fan made card game set in the Fallout universe. Players traverse the lands of post-apocalyptic United States of America, visiting places known from all of the Fallout games. During their adventure, players will meet familiar characters from the game, create teams of followers and gather equipment to aid them in their quest.&#10;&#10;The game features all original art by Oskar Potocki, which immitates the style of the PIP Boy 2000 in-game display.&#10;&#10;2-4 players start the game by selecting their starting characters and equipment. The health of characters and the condition of equipment is determined by placing a D6 dice on the card with the amount of pips showing the current state of the character/equipment. Players also choose their starting perks, and mission cards.&#10;&#10;Missions comprise of three elements: the mission, location and faction (i.e. Fight Ghouls at Tenpenny Tower). Each part of the mission has a check that must be completed by the player in order to complete the mission. If the player can't meet the conditions of the check, they can flee and discard the mission (then they choose a new one). Most of the checks are die rolls which use dice from a wide range i.e. D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 and D20.&#10;&#10;Player parties traverse the radioactive lands of North America. The game map shows most of the locations from all of the Fallout games. Locations are interconnected by roads used by players to travel from one site to the other by means of spending action points. Each location lists all of the actions that can be performed there, ie. Trade, Gamble, Easy/Medium/Hard Mission, rest etc. A player may perform one of the actions in their current location, before their turn is over.&#10;&#10;Travelling through locations, players will gather followers, who can be recruited in a number of ways, but most often by means of selecting a recruit action if it is available at the party's current location. Players will purchase party members with caps (the game's currency) and add them to their play area. A D6 dice will be then placed on the follower card, showing their current state of health. Players will also gain equipment the same way and will also level up their characters in order to prepare their team for the final mission. The final mission is hard to complete and will require a trully great ensemble of characters which are well equipped and levelled up in order to complete the assignment. Once a player completes their final mission, they win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Are you ready for these girls to show you what they've got?! Here it is, the moment you've all been waiting for &mdash; it's STARLIGHT STAGE!&#10;&#10;Starlight Stage is a fast-paced set-collecting card game in which you are playing a talent manager whose aim is to get the best talent of all your rival agencies. You start with the fresh talent of a model, an actress, and a singer. You help to build their careers by collecting lessons, events, and upgrades for them which earns them more fame. The manager with the most famous talent at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;You start the game with three separate decks in a vertical row: the Idol deck, Fame deck, and Event deck. From the top of each deck, you draw a card for each player and lay them in a row next to the deck from which they were drawn. Each player starts with the beginning hand of new talent: the actress, model, and singer. To start the game, the first player has the option of drawing a card from one of the three stacks and adding it to the end of the row, increasing their options of what to purchase. They then use their accumulated talent points to either purchase an assignment card, acquire a fame card, or take a lesson. Play continues until the fame deck is empty. Then all players tally their fame points and whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;The English-language edition of Starlight Stage includes both the original Japanese base game as well as the fourteen cards of Starlight Stage: Expansion Card Set 1.&#10;&#10;",

Every false step could make you miss the most important events; every mistake in planning your itinerary could make you be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

A dashboard/timetable subdivides the design week into three main phases: morning, afternoon and evening. Each time of the day will propose four events taking place at the same time in different locations: the objective of each player is to join at least one event to gain the corresponding card. Every location card represents a design icon-object; with more than one object you will be able to reach the targets that will allow you to achieve more points.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, Death is never welcome, and it's worth two slices of cake each time it shows up.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws a hand of cards, depicting various types of cake or Death. A player may secretly discard one and then must display one remaining card face up. The remaining cards remain hidden. The other players then name a type of cake and take all cards depicting the named type (possibly the one displayed face up), adding them to their permanent collection. However, if the player has no cake of the named type, then Death may show up instead.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the players run through the entire deck. The player with the most slices of any particular type of cake discards all cards of that type. Death always sticks around. Every remaining slice of cake adds one to your final score, while each Death counts as two. The player with the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Holistic is an abstract sequencing game that combines set-collecting and trick-taking in a compact 81-card deck. Each card has a number from 1 to 9, and one of nine shapes. Win by taking the most quints, or placing the final matching card in a sequence.&#10;&#10;The original name of this game is long lost and is mostly referred to as a holistic quint sequencing card game and is there for given the name Holistic for short. One text passage refers to the leviathan chain, but if this is the name of the game or some other principal is still unclear. A suggestion is that this game is better named Quint.&#10;&#10;Holistic was according to Erik Magus L&aring;ng first played on scientific principles by a party of gentlemen who frequented the Holland House, Arkum Street, Hundon (Borough of St Edmundsbury) around 1728. but the game never became fashionable. To be a member of this group you had to write and published research, trivia games or myths of the souls journey, which is the cause records of it still exists today. The game was much later rediscovered and painstakingly recreated by a historian and game design researcher.&#10;&#10;The game is party mention in the book &ldquo;A Short Treatise on the Game of Yellow King&rdquo; published in 1742, in &ldquo;The Principles of holism and its Practice Illustrated on an Original System, by Means of Hands, Numbers and Symbols&rdquo; published in 1862 and in the incomplete manuscripts and personal diary of the above mention Magus L&aring;ng. Holism is the belief that the parts of something are intimately interconnected and explicable only by reference to the whole, emphasizing the importance of the whole and the interdependence of its parts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In order to find out more, you have halted your journey just outside the borders of your homelands in a tavern known for its unruly crowd of battle-worn adventurers, the Burning Phoenix Inn.&#10;&#10;You hope to glean enough information from these experienced warriors and wizards to find out where to begin your adventures.

Also, unlike the Big Geeky Box, this set contains a comprehensive rule book compiling all the rules and card clarifications from all the sets created so far. The set also comes with dividers that name every faction made thus far and for Oops, You Did It Again.

They have to fight for everything, but eventually farms, rich grass pastures and pasturing cattles fill the unusual wasteland with life. &#10;Become the most skilled farmer! Get the most pastures for your cattle! With smart tactics, avoiding storms, using your golds well, with the Indians in peace, you will surely be the king of the prairie.&#10;&#10;Objective of the game:&#10;With the help of farms occupy areas and all five cows should be placed on occupied pastures. The first player places his fifth cow on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;During the game, players must use pasture-shaped triangular cards for the game so that they can build farms in their corners. If one player is in the majority on a pasture - his own farm is in the two corners of the front leg - that player can place one of its cows on this pasture so can take it. The figure remains in the game until the end of the game, regardless of whether the player may have it the majority of the area around the area disappears on the way. Only one cow can be placed on a pasture.&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts. From the 4 cards in his hand he can play as much as cards he can or want. There is only one limit: You can only play one card type in one turn (for example, there is a player holding two farm cards, only one of them can be placed in one turn). Exception is possible with golds.&#10;&#10;",

Side with the honorable Bees wielding weapons of polished gold or align with the villainous Wasps, feral warriors of the badlands.

Each opponent creates a hive by circling his or her queen with strong warriors.&#10;&#10;Once that's complete, each player takes turns laying a card down and then picking one up from the reserve pile. Laying a card down means covering an opponent's card on either hive. This is done with higher numbered cards. If a player lays down a card that strengthens their hive or weakens their opponents, then they are allowed to pick up an &quot;Action&quot; card. Action cards help players build tunnels or smash tunnels. If a tunnel is created to their opponent's queen (in the center) then a smash card can be placed on the queen to win.&#10;&#10;But watch out, your opponent can do the same thing. On your turn, you must decide whether to strengthen the numbers in your hive, or attack your opponent.&#10;&#10;",

One player represents the British command, and the other the leadership of the Rebels. Both sides are trying to gain control of India. The game system is based on the one originally presented in our earlier S&amp;T games: They Died with Their Boots On, Volumes 1 &amp; 2 (S&amp;T 236 &amp; 242). It uses an interactive sequence of play in which command, rebellions and events are randomly generated. The British Empire player controls British Regular, Punjab (including Sikh), Loyal Sepoy, Auxiliary and Nepalese forces. The Rebels initially control no forces but will gain them from Sepoy and Rebel Badmashes units which mutiny. Both players can also mobilize various Princely State forces. Each turn represents roughly two months of time. Each hexagon is about 40 miles across. Each unit represents anywhere from 2000 to 10,000 troops. Leaders represent major commanders, their staffs, and guard troops.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters&#10;&#10;Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #320&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Wayne Manor expansion focuses on Batman's strongholds. It adds seven new playable heroes (Red Robin, Batwing, Batman Armored Suit, Bruce Wayne, Alfred, Oracle, Julia Pennyworth), three sorts of new allies (T-Rex, Bats, Bat Robots), and two new maps (Wayne Manor and the Batcave).&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;This expansion includes two game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes three scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc.&#10;&#10;This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!&#10;&#10;The Batcave:&#10;This game board is separated in 4 parts, connected by an elevator that splits the moves of the characters and forces players to better coordinate their strategy, either as the heroes or the villain. The Batcave can lead to Wayne manor, or to another location, depending whether the scenario involves one of the auxiliary locations scattered all over Gotham. Not all components are used at the same time in every scenario, which makes for greater replayability. The Batcave is almost a character of its own and features myriad defenses such as bat-robots to ward off would-be intruders.&#10;&#10;The T-Rex:&#10;This massive and fierce character is as impressive as you can imagine and is controlled using a double tile. In the comics, it is a mechanized defensive asset, and it doesn&rsquo;t just look threatening. Any intruder looking to enter the trophy room would be wise to think twice while this prehistoric sentry stands watch. From a gameplay perspective, it cannot perform any manipulation or thought actions, but its strength and potential to cause mayhem are tremendous.&#10;&#10;Oracle:&#10;This character isn't a fighter like the others, but she is a genius hacker and the best tactician in the game. She also comes with a tile of three characters to command. Her allies can be given orders and pushed to perform extra moves.&#10;&#10;Alfred:&#10;Bruce's butler is an excellent tactician and support character. Unlike his master Bruce, Alfred will take up arms to defend his loved ones. He may look old, but Alfred Pennyworth is far from feeble.&#10;&#10;Armored Suit Batman:&#10;The Wayne Manor/Batcave expansion features the iconic armor Batman donned to fight off the owls foolish enough to invade his lair. This armored Batman is the only hero who can make melee attacks using black dice; this means rolling dice with the highest damage potential in the game. But this great potential comes with a measure of risk as there is also a chance you will miss completely. This armor may also causes the villain to think twice before attacking because it possesses the best defense capabilities of all the heroes.&#10;&#10;&mdash; from Kickstarter&#10;&#10;",

Each stock card has a color which is always known and a numeric value ranging from 1 to 7 which is often public, but could be claimed secretly. Claiming low value cards grants the player a one-time ability that increases their odds of collecting points. The actual victory point value of each color is determined collectively by all players via trackers on the supply wheel. The values on the wheel rise slowly, crash quickly then cycle back around. The value for each color is tracked independently and is only awarded to the highest shareholders when a supply of stocks runs out. Players attempt to determine which stocks are best to collect, get the highest total of them, and maximize their value at just the right time.&#10;&#10;Victory points are only awarded at the end of each each round. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Color Spiel was chosen as the winner of the 2017 HABA USA Game Design Contest.&#10;&#10;",
