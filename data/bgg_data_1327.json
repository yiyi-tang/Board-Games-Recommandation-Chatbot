Battle your friends, family, and hyper-intelligent pets by drawing and playing from a deck of unique cards that'll either help you, thwart others, or mix things up for the sheer hell of it! To win the game, you just need to start your turn with exactly 10 cards in your hand but if you think that'll be easy, you're wrong (wronger than a duck wearing shoes - and that's pretty damn wrong).&#10;&#10;This follows the same rules as the regular Muffin Time game.  Players draw a card on their turn and can choose to &quot;place&quot; up to three trap cards out of their hand. As a second part of their turn they either pick up one card or play one action card, which are all unique and can have wide-ranging consequences on the other players or game as a whole&#10;&#10;The game ends an a player wins when someone starts their turn holding exactly 10 cards.&#10;&#10;This deluxe version includes cards from the Pie Flavour and Rainbow booster packs so contains 200 cards (the standard 120 plus 40 from each booster).&#10;&#10;",

Soldiers move by rotating on a corner that is touching an adjacent card; either rotating 90 degrees to touch another card, or if it is on a corner, rotating 180 degrees to align to the new edge. Each player makes two moves on their turn, which can be to move two soldiers, or the same soldier twice.&#10;&#10;Soldiers have three possible effects when aligned against an enemy card in certain orientations:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Attack: remove the enemy from play&#10;    Defend: block an Attack&#10;    Capture: flip an enemy card over so that it joins your side&#10;&#10;&#10;By attacking and removing soldiers from play, and capturing enemy cards, you can gain a dominant position and isolate your opponent&rsquo;s cards so that they are unable to move. When they have no possible moves to make, you have won the battle!&#10;&#10;",

The rest will be be easily modifiable to cope with whatever rules or figure scale you want to use. The rules will cope with a wide variety of periods as well.&#10;&#10;I confess that I've always regarded the wargames campaign to be wargaming at its finest. Done properly a campaign can provide far more interesting and unexpected games than just facing an equal points army across the table. This guide is written in an attempt to ensure that you manage to extract the maximum amount of fun whilst limiting the book-keeping. Whether you want to use massed heavy armour, or ride the fleeing enemy infantry down with your wild horsemen, this rule set will help you make sure it's all done in a suitably cost-efficient manner.&#10;&#10;Combat accountancy has never been a particular love of mine and I'd hate to impose it on anybody else.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer / publisher&#10;&#10;",

In addition, tokens of hidden rewards in the form of rabbits for the first, second and third fox who have come to the finish line are placed.&#10;&#10;By rolling the dice, the players determine which foxes are running, using all kinds of bonuses on the field (apples - we additionally move another fox, mushrooms - we move another fox back, holes - allowing you to jump from one path to another path, hedgehogs - which block the victory point for a caught rabbit).&#10;The game ends as soon as the third fox reaches the finish line. After that, points are calculated for the caught rabbits.&#10;&#10;",

After your roll, if any single die or the sum of any number of dice matches your top slice, you remove it; keep removing slices as long as the numbers add up. If, for example, you rolled 1, 2, 5 at the start of the game, you could remove the 1, 2 &amp; 3 slices.&#10;&#10;You now either end your turn or roll again. If you roll again and fail to remove a slice, you must place slice cards back on your deck as a penalty.&#10;&#10;The chance die may give you the opportunity to swap decks with another player &mdash; or force you to swap with whoever has the largest deck! Alternatively, you might gain the Nope! token and use it to block a deck, whether to keep an opponent from removing cards from it or to protect your deck from being stolen.&#10;&#10;Countalope can also be played as a multi-round game, with players scoring 1 point per card removed, with a game ending when someone has 16 points. Whoever reaches 100 points first wins.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s based on the Austro-Prussian (1866) and Franco-Prussian wars (1871), conflicts that made the unification of German a reality. Players take on the roles of leaders of France, Prussia, Austria and Italy to try to reshape the map of Central Europe to their advantage one more time. The scale of the game may not be as epic as in other expansions or the base Coalitions, but the stakes are high nonetheless!&#10;&#10;The Realpolitik Expansion is designed for 1-4 players, with a new solo mode and an emphasis on the competitive 2-player mode in which both players control two nations. The Activator system is modified to fit this mode and the overall theme of the expansion is a bit different &ndash; let&rsquo;s just say, we&rsquo;re not forgetting to take into account the massive impact of mid-19the century railways.&#10;&#10;Realpolitik also introduces more asymmetry between the nations than in the Coalitions base game, from highly militant Prussia and economically strong France, to newly but not fully united Italy, and multi-ethnic Austria.&#10;&#10;As with the other standalone expansions, Realpolitik comes with its own set of components, including a new Wheel of War and a new game board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Down to their last few slices of bread, players compete with one another in a variety of challenges to make the best (or worst) sandwiches according to a handful of different score categories such as &quot;Taste&quot;, &quot;Affordability&quot;, &quot;Wow Factor&quot;, and more, using a hodgepodge of ingredients.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player draws 3 ingredient cards to add to their hand. Each ingredient card has different stat categories that affect how desirable an ingredient is for a given Challenge. At the beginning of each round, a Challenge card is drawn. The Challenge card outlines which stat categories each player&rsquo;s sandwich should have. Players must play a minimum of 1 card for their sandwich. Cards must be played face-down. When all players are done creating their sandwich, the ingredients are revealed and the player with the sandwich best suited to the Challenge wins the round.&#10;&#10;The player with the winning sandwich will keep the Challenge card for the round. Once all of the Challenge cards have been played, the player with the most Challenge cards collected wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In the shootout, either party may be arrested / withdrawn or killed depending on the dice rolls and modifier cards played.&#10;You also have to discover and dismantle the distillery tiles, playing the appropriate cards or detect the situation of the secret police station tiles to avoid their controls.&#10;The cards also allow moving the control barriers that close some of the exits of the city, both to one team and another.&#10;The smugglers and thieves achieve their objective as soon as they manage to leave the city and obtain the corresponding economic reward.&#10;The policemen achieve their objectives by preventing the cars from leaving the city, arresting or killing them, and dismantling distilleries.&#10;The game ends when half of the gangsters' troops disappear (cars and / or tiles) or when they manage to accumulate a predetermined amount of money.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has their own deck of recipes, but the ingredients in the Kitchen are shared. When players complete a Recipe, they set that recipe card along with any ingredients used to complete it aside in a completed pile. Players then reveal a new recipe from their deck.&#10;&#10;When a player has no cards left to draw from their Recipe deck, the round ends. Players score one point for each completed Recipe and Ingredient used to complete those recipes (ignoring Sketchy Substitutes). The player with the most points, wins the round and earns a star card. Each star earned increases the difficulty for that player in future rounds by limiting the number of recipes they can have active. The first player to collect the required amount of stars, wins.&#10;&#10;",

They must work to seal these escapees back into the book. However, the demons are actually Demons of Numbers and therefore the players cannot speak in numbers (or else be cursed and die).&#10;&#10;The basic gameplay is the same as The Game, where players work together to discard all cards into four piles depending on the UP/DOWN conditions of each pile. During their turn, players discard either a larger or smaller value card(s) as appropriate. Afterwards, players refill their hand.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;Players cannot share the numbers of the cards in their hand with other players but must find ways to collaborate in order to effectively place cards in the four piles so that all players can have zero cards in their hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;If there is an exact difference of 10 between the card a player discards and the last card in a pile, the player is free to play the card regardless of the UP/DOWN direction of the pile.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;In Demons of Numbers, there are also six types of effect cards (which are number cards with an effect written at the bottom): Reverse, Skip, Short, Draw 2, Silence, and Declaration of Death.&#10;&#10;There are three types of ending results for the game: Total victory, victory, and loss.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Additional Information:&#10;&#10;This all new game builds upon the original The Game with additional rules for a spookishly fresh gameplay experience.&#10;&#10;Unlike The Game Extreme which added rules to make gameplay even more challenging for players, Demons of Numbers offers a more interactive, conversational experience. The new design also allows for up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Familiar &ldquo;effects&rdquo; are added to the game to give it a more UNO-esque familiarity. In fact, these changes have earned this version of the game the nickname &ldquo;The Game Junior&rdquo; by the original publisher.&#10;&#10;The increased player number, new rules, and random events make it more difficult for players to find a repeatable pattern to beat the game and result in a making Demons of Numbers more of a &ldquo;party game&rdquo; for all ages and for gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;&#10;The designer, 326, felt that the original The Game had a title that was really not ideally optimized for easy internet searches, as well as artwork that would make it for children to convince their parents to purchase the game for them. He wanted to take a new approach and was able to find a willing partner in Arclight Games.&#10;&#10;Illustrations are also by 326.&#10;&#10;",

As a family on this small island, you must grow and harvest resources, befriend animals, and search for treasures.&#10;&#10;On your turn, spin the wheel, then place a resource on your field. When you complete a row, column, or diagonal, shout &quot;Bingo!&quot;, then collect the appropriate tools and make friends with animals. Finally, search the sand for treasures containing gold coins while trying to avoid the crabs.&#10;&#10;As soon as an islander collects four treasures, the game ends, then the islander with the most gold coins wins.&#10;&#10;",

There are classic duels with some twists, missions, and two Juggernaut scenarios.&#10;&#10;You will need Federation Commander ship cards and rules to play these scenarios; however, you can also simply enjoy reading about the various parts of Star Fleet Universe history.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Story:&#10;Our reigning emperor is obsessed with two things: war and herbal tea. In times of war, we are largely free. Since our nation is at peace, we are all forced to spend every waking moment serving the Emperor tea. It's worse than death. It's monotonous. So, we've all decided: The Emperor must die.&#10;&#10;So...ahem. We challenge you to a duel!&#10;&#10;Experience:&#10;Suspicious Brew is a bluffing game where you and your royal court are locked in a tea-time battle of wits, serving up a deserving death to the Emperor as you compete for the title of &ldquo;tricksiest hero of all.&rdquo; The game gets really intriguing and silly when you start choosing your secret agendas based on the evolving social dynamics of the court, knowing your friends know that you know they know you know how they play each role, and that they will use that against you, and you know it! When that happens, you feel determined to outwit them, or to just plain old lie your pants off to thwart their efforts!&#10;&#10;Interesting elements:&#10;Your Agendas are chosen, not dealt randomly. The role of Emperor has all the authority to make decisions, and the players they rely on have all the first hand information and are the only ones who can influence the outcome of each round. Each Secret Agenda has a vague alignment, but everyone is in it for themselves, so cooperation outside of your &quot;faction&quot; can be valuable. Everyone has the chance to play the Emperor once before the Emperor dies. The emotional stakes are lower than many other bluffing games, because the narrative being played out is absurd, and person who gets screwed over ultimately is not any of the players but the fictional Emperor.&#10;&#10;This game is certified non-toxic to friendships.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
