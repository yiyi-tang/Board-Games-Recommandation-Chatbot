In August, with the aid of England and Esthonia, the Russian &ldquo;Northwestern Government&rdquo; was established. Yudenich&rsquo;s planned Fall offensive was timed to coincide with the pinnacle of the White&rsquo;s success, as Denikin approached Orel and Tula, the munitions-manufacturing center. From there it was only a short distance to Moscow. Heroic Frenzy covers the battle for Petrograd during this time.&#10;&#10;The map scale is about 3-3.5 miles per hex. Each aircraft unit represents one aircraft, each tank unit equals one AFV (armored fighting vehicles), and each armor car unit represents three armor cars. White units are brigades (X), battalions (II). Red units are brigades (X). A game turn represents two days.&#10;&#10;",

For the youngest it's a game of finding Hopla (the well-known bunny) and for the older kids you can use the cards to give clues as to where Hopla might be hiding.&#10;&#10;Hopla calls out 5 times (Hopla! Hopla! Hopla!) and needs to be found within that time. Different variants are in the game's rulebook and will be added to the website later on.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the not too distant future war and fighting have been banned on the planet earth.&#10;All disputes are now resolved on the moon through hand to hand combat. Each nation involved in a dispute chooses its 7 most powerful warriors to compete in a decisive battle.&#10;&#10;Moon Melee is an abstract strategy game in which players play cards to determine the movement of their warriors. The warriors are represented by dice and have a life force of 6.&#10;Players take turns moving and attacking their opponents. When a warrior is reduced to a 0 life force they are removed from the game. The game takes place on a 7 X 7 square grid. The player with the most life force after 3 rounds is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each corner has a plastic 'gate' which is used to trap marbles &amp; score points.&#10;&#10;Each turn, marbles are introduced one at a time into a rotating transparent plastic chamber which occupies the center of the gameboard. As they roll wildly and with great speed around the board players attempt to trap them with their plastic gate. Although it is possible to squeeze more marbles behind the gate, there are only enough small depressions to safely hold three at any one time. There are eight marbles per turn - seven white (worth 1 point) and a single red marble worth 6 points which is always introduced into the rotating chamber last. At the end of each turn scores are tallied and the next player spins the central chamber.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach 12 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

For example, the card with the letter Z matches the picture of a Zebra on a square on the board. The card with a picture of an Owl, matches the square on the board with the letter O.&#10;&#10;2-GAMES-IN-1:&#10;&#10;GET RID OF THE CARDS&#10;Each payer is dealt a number of cards (for instance 4 cards each). In order to get rid of a card, a player must land on the matching square.

When a player collects a card, a new card is turned face up. Before the game starts, the Players agree on the number of cards in total (for instance 12 cards). When all cards are collected, the player with the most cards has won the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1942 and the Japanese navy is on the offensive.  With American naval units heavily depleted after Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Coral Sea, the Imperial Japanese Navy is seeking to strike a decisive blow and consolidate their hold on the Pacific, a prelude to further expansion for the Empire of Japan.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Battle of Midway&rdquo; is a turn based game of fleet strategy and close Carrier tactics, pitting the naval fleets of the United States Navy Pacific Fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy against one another.&#10;&#10;Based loosely on the actual events of the 4-7th June 1942 Battle of Midway, players take the role of either;&#10;&#10;i) Supreme Commander Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in command of three Carrier Groups &amp; one Battleship Group&#10;&#10;or&#10;&#10;ii) Combined Fleet Commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy in command of three Carrier Groups &amp; one Battleship Group&#10;&#10;The following Carriers &amp; Battleships form the core of the Carrier Groups in this game;&#10;&#10;United States Navy Pacific Fleet&#10;1.)

IJN Yamato&#10;&#10;Play is done on individual war charts which only show friendly fleet deployments with ship movements, attack phases and search phases plotted in real time. You have already been informed by Naval intelligence that the enemy fleet is no longer in port.  Where is the enemy fleet?  How are his ships arrayed?  What is their target objective?  Should you seek the enemy fleet before he strikes?  Should you push ahead with plans to land marines and take the strategic Pacific islands?  Or should you take the war to the enemy and attempt to sneak in a lightning strike on his now undefended home ports?&#10;&#10;These are questions you need to answer as your battlegroup streams out to engage the enemy.  Visibility is only limited to the immediate area around your bases and ships.  You will need to send out spotter planes or submarines to screen your fleet as you race to the be first to find and engage the enemy before he finds you.  Enemy fleets must be found and destroyed, and the Commander with the best intelligence and planning will prevail!&#10;&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                &#10;                                                                            &#10;                                                                        &#10;                                                                    &#10;                                                                &#10;                                                            &#10;                                                        &#10;                                                    &#10;                                                &#10;                                            &#10;                                        &#10;                                    &#10;                                &#10;                            &#10;                        &#10;                    &#10;                &#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;You are now in command of one of the most powerful fleets in history.&#10;&#10;As Admiral, you will be required to plan and submit a Battle Plan to HQ for the forth-coming battle at Midway.  Included in this report, would be your choices for Group Unit Mix, Flag Carrier to bear you into battle, and suitable Battle group deployments for each one of your battle groups.  A good commander knows that this initial planning may hold the key to victory and will ensure that a comprehensive strategy and matching Battle group deployments are well set out into a workable plan on paper, well before any ship even begins to leave the harbor.&#10;&#10;Having done the initial planning, you are now ready to set sail with your battle groups and put your strategic battle plan into action.  Moving your fleets out into the open ocean, you plot the moves of your Fleet Deployments onto your War Chart, watching as events unfold.  These first few moves will be crucial in determining the overall battle positions of your fleets as you head towards enemy waters.  Do you move your fleets in a broad front, or concentrate them into a narrow wedge, aimed straight for the enemy&rsquo;s heart?  How would the enemy be deployed?  What is his plan?  These are questions you must ask yourself as Admiral.  Decide well, and surprise is on your side.  Decide poorly, and risk losing the initiative to a craftier enemy.&#10;&#10;With your fleets in position, you now steam steadily towards the enemy.  The War Chart now shows the radial tracks from your scouts.  But where is the enemy?  As the gap between friend and foe narrow, a race develops to see who will be the first to spot the other.  Will luck be on your side, or will you fail to send out your scouts in a well-planned search pattern and allow enemy bombers to slip through to your vulnerable Carriers?  These are questions only you can answer as you sit and wait for the search reports to trickle in.&#10;&#10;Suddenly, the enemy is upon you and your picket ships are hit.  As you stare out onto the flight deck from your bridge, what do you do?  Do you circle your wagons and search frantically for the enemy, throwing fighter wings into the air in the hope of slugging it out with the enemy bombers which are sure to follow, or try and scatter your ships to disappear back into the vast empty ocean to regroup?&#10;&#10;Should you launch bombers from afar, for that long-range strike into the enemy rear, or go in close for a classic surface naval engagement with your Battleship, Cruisers and Destroyers?&#10;&#10;Game Objectives&#10;&#10;A win is achieved with any one of the following objectives fulfilled;&#10;&#10;1.) Destroy all ground defenders and occupy both Midway Atoll and Wake Island with your Marines&#10;&#10;2.) Destroy all ground defenders and occupy all three enemy home ports with your Marines&#10;&#10;3.) Sink the enemy Flagship (Carrier or Battleship)&#10;&#10;The game ends in a draw if no more Troop transports are still afloat from either team or when the loss of too many units on both sides make it impossible to complete the stated objectives.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You've all wondered about it. Some have even argued about it. Now you can play it for yourself to see which side would win.&#10;&#10;This game was developed to help cross-understanding of the two different chess systems.&#10;&#10;One side plays with the Western Chess pieces, the other with the Chinese Chess pieces.&#10;&#10;Due to the differences in western and eastern chess boards, both halves of the board retain the characteristics of each side. The number of squares have been increased to accommodate the slightly larger Chinese chess board. A central row on the Chinese chess side terminates at the &quot;river&quot; to merge into the western chess board. Units playing at the central row interface play as per normal but with a termination at the end of the row. Bishops and Queen moving along the diagonal will side-step across the central row to maintain the same colour of squares.&#10;&#10;Because of Eastern initial advantage checkmating with catapults in first move, West starts.&#10;&#10;All usual rules apply.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Western - King - 1 step in any direction&#10;     Eastern - ji&agrave;ng/shuai (General/Marshal) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)&#10;     Western - Queen - moves diagonally and vertically/horizontally&#10;     Eastern - sh&igrave; (Scholar/Official) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)&#10;     Western - Bishop - moves diagonally&#10;     Eastern -  xi&agrave;ng (Elephant/Minister) - moves in 2 step diagonals (blocked by a piece along its diagonal) (cannot cross river)&#10;     Western - Knight - moves in 2/1 step &quot;L&quot; (blocked by a piece along the long side of the &quot;L&quot; when in Eastern territory)&#10;     Eastern - ma(Horse/Cavalry) - moves in 2/1 step &quot;L&quot; ( blocked by a piece along the long side of &quot;L&quot; when in Eastern territory)&#10;     Western - Castle - moves vertically/diagonally&#10;     Eastern - ju (Chariot/Wagon) - moves vertically/diagonally&#10;     Eastern - pao (Catapult/Cannon) - moves vertically/horizontally, takes enemy piece by leaping over another piece&#10;     Western - Pawn - 1 step forward, takes enemy piece 1 step diagonally (1 or 2 step opening move)&#10;     Eastern -zu/bing (Private/Soldier) - 1 step forward (across the river, 1 step vertically/horizontally)&#10;&#10;&#10;Other rules;&#10;Western Chess Unique Rules&#10;1. Castling&#10;2. Pawns resurrect to any previously &quot;taken&quot; piece upon reaching the end of board &lt;-- no longer applies&#10;&#10;Chinese Chess Unique Rules&#10;1. Horses/Cavalry are blocked by pieces straddling the long leg of L &lt;-- only within Eastern Territory&#10;2. Elephants/Ministers are blocked by pieces straddling the diagonal&#10;3. Privates/Soldiers can move horizontally upon crossing the river&#10;4. General/Marshal and Shi cannot exit the fortress except when jumping out to kill opposing King in direct line of sight&#10;5. Elephants/Ministers cannot cross the river&#10;&#10;Some Game specific basic notes:&#10;1. West always moves first (or East checkmates with his catapult in 1 move)&#10;2. Korean Chess rules will be used in the case of the Eastern General and both Shi. They can now move both horizontally and diagonally along the fortress lines&#10;3. The Eastern General retains the ability to jump in order to &quot;take&quot; the Western King but not vice-versa so the Western King needs to avoid &quot;seeing&quot; the Eastern General&#10;4. The Western horse upon crossing the river into Eastern territory, will be subjected to the same blocking (horse-leg) rule as Eastern cavalry whilst in Eastern territory&#10;5. The Eastern cavalry upon crossing the river into Western territory, will no longer be subjected to the blocking (horse-leg) rule whist in Western territory&#10;6. The Western pawn no longer has the ability to upgrade to another previously &quot;taken&quot; piece upon reaching the end as it does so within the Eastern board&#10;&#10;An article on the game was published in the German daily &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot; (transl.: &quot;New Germany&quot;), 22nd September 2007. http://www.nd-online.de/artikel.asp?AID=116589&amp;IDC=27&#10;&#10;For more info: http://www.act.com.sg/eastvswest/&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Adapted from the old Macintosh Computer game, this game pits 2 or more players in a battle to see who can programme the most efficient tank. The tank with the most efficient yet adaptable programming and subroutines will dominate the battlefield and vanquish the other tanks.&#10;&#10;Storyline&#10;You are a battlefield commander of an evolutionary new tank in the battlefield of the future. Wars of today are fought by remote war machines. Pitted against you is your enemy, fielding their latest war machines. This will be a fight to the finish, the struggle for supremacy.&#10;&#10;With your superior skills as a commander, you are to programme your tank and set it loose. Win or lose will depend on your intimate knowledge of your own tank's inherent abilities as well as your uncanny reading of what your opponent's tank will do and how you perceive it would react in battle.&#10;&#10;Win or lose, after each round, redesign, re-programme, rework your tank's subroutines and primary programming to fine-tune your tank's performance. Remember, your enemy is doing the same thing. He would have watched the previous battle and noted his tank's and your tank's performance. He too will be working to reduce deficiencies and weak points in his own programming so as to triumph over yours. Then when you're both done with your re-programming, set let them go at it again! Send out prototype after prototype until either your tanks now reign supreme in every engagement, or they all lie devastated, crushed under the steel treads of better enemy tanks.&#10;&#10;Programming is limited to the number of standard programming tiles available in the common pile but be wary of cumbersome programming that may make your tank less than efficient as it spends a fatally long among of time processing your programming while your opponent's more efficient design finds and destroys your tank!&#10;&#10;Gentlemen, start your engines.... and let the games begin.&#10;&#10;Game Pieces&#10;1 dice (to determine your tank start position on the board)&#10;1 main &quot;battlefield&quot; board - (for 2P board 17steps across, + 1P add 3steps across)&#10;2 primary programming plates&#10;8 subroutine programming plates; 2xFight, 2xEvade, 2xFlee, 2xDamaged&#10;1 red team light tank&#10;1 orange team light tank&#10;1 red team heavy tank&#10;1 orange team heavy tank&#10;6 &quot;damage&quot; pins&#10;&#10;A) 1 step Action Tiles&#10;i) Move Forward 1 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;ii) Move Forward 2 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;iii) Move Forward 3 (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)&#10;iv) Turn Left 1 (60 degrees) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;v) Turn Left 2 (120 degrees) (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)&#10;vi) Turn Right 1 (60 degrees) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;vii) Turn Right 2 (120 degrees) (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)&#10;viii) Reverse 1 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;ix) Complete Halt - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)&#10;x) Detect Level 3 (Logic Gate) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;&#10;B) 2 step Action Tiles&#10;i) Detect Level 4 (Logic Gate) (only Heavy Tank) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;ii) Fire - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)&#10;iii) Shield Activated - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;iv) Shield Deactivated - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;&#10;C) Decision Tiles (goto)&#10;i) FIGHT subroutine (Logic Gate) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;ii) FLEE subroutine - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;iii) EVADE subroutine - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)&#10;iv) return to PRIMARY - (for 2P 8pcs, + 1P add 5pcs)&#10;&#10;notes:&#10;1) Tank start positions are determined by a throw of the dice and placed on the corresponding number on the board&#10;2) Action and Decision tiles are limited.

He used to take his carrots to market in a wheelbarrow, but one day, over the radio, he heard that airships where much faster than wheelbarrows, so he bought himself something with which he could fly in the clouds.&#10;&#10;So here we have a playing board to represent the country over which Uncle Wiggily flew from his carrot farm to the market where he sold his yellow vegetables.  But the rabbit had so many adventures in his new airship as he did when hopping through the woods to cure his rheumatism at Dr. Possom's office.  There were storms, waterspouts and he fell into tail spins and once had to jump in a parachute.&#10;&#10;The moves are made by drawing cards.  There are 105 white cards, each one telling you how many miles to hop Uncle Wiggily through the air.  There are 35 red cards, which may move Uncle Wiggily ahead or perhaps delay hime for a turn or two, all according to luck.&#10;&#10;The air path, from Uncle Wiggily's farm to the market is marked by sign boards each containing a letter instead of a number.  And when these letters are separated into words, beginning at the farm, they spell out a funny little verse.  See if you can write it down after the game.&#10;&#10;",

You just earned 5 points.&#10;     &quot;Mish Moshing&quot; the Language - Build sentences out of English words written somewhat phonetically with Hebrew letters.&#10;     Historical Mish Mosh - This variation can be played by any number of players.  One player thinks of a &quot;a famous Jewish Historical person&quot;, then spells his or her name with the tiles.  (e.g. ABRAHAM)  The next person must think of another whose name starts with the final letter of the previous one.  (e.g. MOSHEH).  This is an elimination game like HORSE:  Each time you fail, you &quot;earn&quot; a letter of MISH MOSH.  Once you have spelled the whole name, you are out.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each tile has both the traditional print letter and its handwritten equivalent.  There are no tiles for &quot;final&quot; forms of letters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "JokerFace is a card game where players try to run out of cards they are holding.  Players connect cards from their hand to those played face-up on the table.  Cards are connected by matching symbols (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades and Clubs).  Some cards have Jokers on them, which are wild.  There are also 8 Face cards (King, Queen, Jack, and Ace) that give players special abilities during the game.  If players can place a card that connects to two cards simultaneously, they may play an additional card the same turn.  Players start their turns by drawing a card, so playing more than one each turn is vital.  Each card also has text on it (Blue or Red), that create special circumstances (Rotating cards 90 degrees, Flipping them 180 degrees, and Moving them to another location on the &quot;board&quot;).  Some cards played allow you to automatically play additional cards, and some force you to draw more.&#10;&#10;",

The defender can move on black and red lines in any direction.  The defender can also jump over and remove any enemy on an adjacent spot if a vacant spot exists beyond.  The attacker cannot jump and cannot move backward on the red lines.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board represents a military strategy map of enemy territory with numerous objective spots from Take Off to Mission Accomplished.&#10;&#10;The players advance through the map by identifying silhouettes of friendly and enemy planes.  Success allows the player to move forward the number of spaces listed on the card.  Failure requires the player to back up as noted on the card.  Other spaces on the map include the Army Flash and Danger Flash spots.  These force the player to draw a card and follow the instructions noted.&#10;&#10;First person to the Mission Accomplished space wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rules:  A game of Naval Manoeuvres for two players.  Each player manoeuvres his fleet with the object of occupying naval bases of his opponent to the value of 100 points.  Whilst planning attack, defence, must not be neglected, and much strategy is required for manoeuvring to the best advantage.&#10;&#10;Differences in strength and speed of the various units of the fleet and in the configuration of the coasts marked on the charts are such that innumerable situations arise, and the game is full of variety.&#10;&#10;Each player has 1 battleship, 1 submarine, 3 cruisers, and 5 destroyers and they are PINNED (yep pinned) onto the board to show their location.  Bases are captured by ships entering them and they are marked by pins to show ownership.   Each ship has a movement value (for example destroyers rate a 3) and in a turn a player cannot move more than 10 points.  To resolve battles the teetotum is used.&#10;&#10;It has 6 Bs (Battleship) 4 Cs (Cruiser) and 2 Ds (Destroyer).  Its is spun and if the letter matches the attacking ships its a hit (submarines always use the letter of the ship they are attacking so they have an equal chance against any ship).&#10;&#10;Very interesting game and you get to push pins into a board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Naval wargames rules covering the period 1914-1928. Designed to be played with 1:3000 models on a tabletop or 1:1200 models in a hall. Originally published in 1973. This entry based on the 1975 second edition. &#10;The rules have an introduction to the period followed by rule concepts and ship statistic calculation rules. Then firing guns and torpedoes, hitting mines, clearing mines fuel, submarines, ramming and weather are covered. The final section of the rulebook covers statistics for ships of the period plus where to buy models and get reference material: a task much easier now with the advent of the internet.&#10;The ground scale used is 1:6 and time scale is 1 minute per turn. &#10;Some preparation is required before play can commence as turning circles must be made and ship statistics calculated for the ships in action.&#10;&#10;",
