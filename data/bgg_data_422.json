Players gain support from one of the two warring families, either the Pandava or Kaurava. To win, players must obtain 1 Celestial Weapon card, 1 Flag or Conch card, 8 Virtue Cards and 18 Coins.&#10;&#10;Players roll 2d6 to move around the board, each square of which is an event. Warrior squares grant the support of individual warriors (such as Arjuna or Karna), or require a Joust (if the warrior square denotes someone who is in the same family as those that support the player) or a Fight (if from the other family). Karma squares confer a card with random events, such as &ldquo;you grab 2 Coins from each player!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Give up 2 coins to receive 2 Virtue Cards.&rdquo; Prowess squares give cards that confer either Virtue cards (needed to win) or Wrath cards (which cause a Virtue discard) to the various warriors. Many squares are a people (Krishna, Queen Kunti, etc.) or places (Indraprastha, Abode of Yama, etc.) that confer a random event, often a Blessing or Coins. Subtracks allow special 1d6 movement through Exile or Trial where players can obtain the key winning elements of Celestial Weapons and Flags/Conches.&#10;&#10;The cards and board both relate some of the many events from the epic. The designer is a noted educator, and this was clearly intended to be an educational game.&#10;&#10;",

It is part of the Whist family of card games and similar to spades, but there is no bidding, and trump is declared every hand.&#10;&#10;The object of Hokm is to be the first team or player to win 7 points. It's the most popular card game in Iran. Deal and play are anticlockwise.&#10;&#10;The word Hokm literally means &quot;command, order&quot; but in card game jargon, it's Persian for trump suit.&#10;&#10;H&acirc;kem&#10;At the beginning of each hand, one of the players becomes H&acirc;kem. H&acirc;kem literally means &quot;ruler, governor&quot; and in card game jargon, it refers to a player having certain privileges in the game. In Hokm, these privileges are:&#10;&#10;- To be the player who receives the first cards dealt. &#10;- To be the player who makes trump (i.e. chooses and declares what suit will be trump) for the current hand. &#10;- To be the player who leads to the first trick of the hand.&#10;&#10;Players and Cards&#10;Hokm can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. If with four players, two players normally team up against the other two.&#10;&#10;The game uses a standard 52-card deck. Within each suit, the cards are ranked from highest to lowest: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2&#10;&#10;",

The only components required are 3standard six-sided dice and a small bowl in which to roll them.&#10;&#10;Players take turns making wagers, then rolling the dice to try to outscore each other.  Very lucky rolls, called 'storms', can even multiply the wagers several fold.  A common analogy compares Chinchirorin to an oriental version of 'craps'.&#10;&#10;",

The game simulates battles between opposing factions, and features all the characters and mechas from the anime. Though not 'collectible' in a traditional sense (all of the cards are the same rarity, sold in pre-constructed 'theme' decks), the game is still fully customizable, with over 250 unique cards planned in the full set for deck construction.&#10;&#10;There are 5 different decks currently available, each containing 50 cards with a fixed composition (no randomly inserted cards):&#10;&#10;Robotech CCG Starter deck&#10;Azonia' Forces Deck&#10;Blue Squadron Deck&#10;Breetai's Forces Deck&#10;The SDF-1 Deck&#10;&#10;Hero Factory also plans to release two additional decks, the 'Robotech Masters 2-Player Starter' and the 'New Generation 2-Player Starter', early in 2007, but further details beyond that point have not been disclosed.&#10;&#10;",

Every turn, a player rolls a die and moves his pawn (a skater) as many spaces forward as the die indicates.&#10;&#10;Depending on the field where he ends, several follow-up actions are possible, such as having to move back some spaces (due to adverse wind) or taking another turn (because the public cheers you on). On certain fields, the player must answer a trivia question on the Elfstedentocht. The questions are about the race itself and about the eleven cities.&#10;&#10;",

Like Snakes and Ladders, it takes place on a square board with a boustrouphedron track, and players roll a die to move their piece from start to finish. The distinguishing features of this distinct subgenre are that the board is set in a playground with many children playing on a see-saw, a slide, a Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, and so on. Some squares will have instructions that will move the player forward, backward or cause a missed turn.&#10;&#10;Like other traditional Chinese games of this ilk, it is made by different companies and comes in small boxes with a folded paper board - in this case, the board is often fairly colourful. More modern versions include cartoon character themes (e.g. Doraemon Kang Le Qi, Snoopy Kang Le Qi).&#10;&#10;",

This game was designed in 1977 when 25mm was the dominant figure scale (15mm scale had just come into being), but you can easily change the scale for movement and range by dividing the 25mm distances in half or by replacing inches with centimeters. You can use any English Civil war minis for this and the has four pages of line drawings showing how the armies look and what colors to use for each of the different armies. &#10;     Scale for 28mm is 1 figure = 20 men. You can change this if you like using 15, 6, or even 2mm (for 1:1 fun) change range and movement distance as you scale down. &#10;     Orders are written down with simultaneous movement.&#10;&#10;",

Some examples: &quot;Your favorite typeface is Helvetica. Back 1 space.&quot; &quot;Your intern just cut off a finger with an X-acto knife. Back 2 spaces.&quot; &quot;Your customer faxed you their camera-ready ad. Back 3 spaces.&quot; &quot;Finally sold your old CompuGraphic.

    "Description": "A classic Stock Market Board Game that provides players with the same opportunities and risks. The players no longer need to depend on luck to win the game but rather on their intellectual prowess.  The game includes 3 stocks, each having 6 quarterly earning cards and 3 quarterly dividend cards. &#10; The game starts with disclosure of each stock's 3 quarterly earning cards and 1 quarterly dividend cards. Therefore, during the game the players need to sum up the three quarterly earnings and calculate the probabilities of the fourth quarterly earning in order to estimate this year's annual earning, and further the year-end target prices. With comparisons of the current stock prices, the players can conclude if the stock is over-valued or under-valued.  There are also day-to-day return-on-equities and risks due to the fluctuation of each stock. The game provides players the opportunities to play as day-traders or long-run investors, or both. This game teaches players the portfolio management skills and how to make correct strategic investment decisions on the stock market.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Space Goblins&quot; is a unique wargame of Man-to-Goblin combat aboard Spaceships. The premise behind the game is that goblins are real, humans drove them away from Earth a long time ago, and now that humans are space-faring, they discover that the goblins have the same technology and are out for revenge!&#10;&#10;The game map depicts a human Federation Star Explorer spaceship which has been rammed and boarded by a goblin War Cruiser, part of which is also depicted on the mapsheet. The ships are divided into corridors and compartments. The counters represent individual combatants. There is no grid, movement is simply conducted room to room. The rules incorporate miniatures-style concepts for units to obstruct movement and line-of-sight. Given the bloodthirsty nature of goblins on the edge of going berzerk, the two forces fight until one side is eliminated.&#10;&#10;While the game system is fairly straightforward, there are a number of interesting elements (for example, there is no stacking of counters -- instead, the rules allow for as many counters as can fit into a room on the map without overlapping). There are also a number of special unit types, such as Witch Doctors for the goblins (who can bring the dead back to life), Robots for the humans, and Technicians for both sides. The latter have various skills, including creating and removing barriers, unjamming weapons, etc.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mysterious treasure of the Aruba Pirates is on the sea-bottom and may be claimed. Since a player cannot do this alone, friends must be called, i.e. collect four maps (cards) of the player's own sea inhabitant friend in four different colors. Whoever succeeds first wins.&#10;&#10;Each player plays one of their four cards (maps) from their hand to the center of the table and compares it with the four maps which are already laid out on the table. The player may either take all maps matching the value of the player's map exactly or take all maps which add up to the number on the player's map. Maps which match the player's designated friend (sea inhabitant) and are of a missing color are added to the others displayed in front of him/her. The others are placed in the player's own discard pile. After all players have played their hand of four map cards, a new round begins. Maps in the center of the table remain.&#10;&#10;A few specially designed cards bring additional excitement to the game. For example, with the help of these cards one can snatch away maps of the other players laid out in front of them or take all maps which are laid out in the table center. One may replace the maps that were taken by equivalent maps from their own discard pile. Therefore it is recommended that the player collect some of their own friend maps of the color he/she has already laid out. It is important for the other players to note which colors are in each discard pile as well.&#10;&#10;In a variant the progressing values of collected friend maps play a larger role.&#10;&#10;Arubas Treasure game did very well with our younger play testers (ages six to ten years). Luck, easy arithmetic, and some memory are part of game play. The maps are beautifully illustrated and of good quality. Thus all in all a really beautiful game for families, more fun with 3 or 4 treasure seekers.&#10;&#10;Beate and Hans Schmidt&#10;(Translation done in Google, with a little help from Mary Prasad - some parts skipped due to being incomprehensible.)&#10;&#10;",

Barges await at the docks; trucks start in the middle on individual tracks. Dice are rolled moving trucks along track to warehouse, where they will unload their cargo onto the waiting barges. In-between, however, are points of difficulty: Pilot Station, where one must be certain his Captain is aboard the ship by rolling the green faces on the dice; Point of Application, where one must be certain all papers and formalities are in order by rolling until the green faces on the dice appear; and the Rail Road Overpass, where, again, the green must be rolled before continuing on to the waiting barge. The first player to unload three containers may call himself and his port the best and fastest in the world.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns holding the bag with the clear side facing away (so the other players can see the pieces inside). The current player selects a piece by touch that matches a piece of the right size and shape on his card. If it is the right color, he places it on his card. The first to fill his card wins.&#10;&#10;A variant for any number of players is to place up to three cards in the center of the table. Players try to select by touch a piece that matches any piece on any card. A player who draws one of the right color places it on a card. Otherwise, he keeps the piece. When the bag is empty, the player with the fewest pieces in front of him wins.&#10;&#10;Players are encouraged to use words, noises, gestures and expressions to mislead the active player into thinking he is touching the correct (or incorrect) color.&#10;&#10;",

In addition it has 10 land scenarios and 12 naval ones.&#10;&#10;One set of miniatures rules is called Battle Scale (1 figure = 50 men), and the other Small Unit Scale (1 figure = 15 men). The third set of rules covers naval actions.&#10;&#10;Leaders are handled extremely well in this game. Each leader is rated as one of Brilliant, Efficient, Plodding or Buffoon(!). Ordinary playing cards are used to determine a number of actions each leader may initiate. Cards used include Aces (one action), 2s and 3s (2 and 3 actions, of course) and Jokers (2 actions and reshuffle). A Buffoon's deck has only one &quot;3&quot; card in it, but four aces, while a Brilliant Leader's is the opposite. Thus a small, well-led force can run rings around a much larger, poorly-led one. In the land battles actions affect firing, movement and formation changes; in the naval game they affect firing only.&#10;&#10;Quick and fun, as well as being adaptable to other, similar periods.&#10;&#10;",

The objective of the game is to get all of your cars to their goals while using your hedgehogs to obstruct the other players' cars. When a hedgehog and a car ends up on the same space a card is drawn. The card asks for a certain type of insurance card. If the player can't provide said card, he has to act out a certain mission.
