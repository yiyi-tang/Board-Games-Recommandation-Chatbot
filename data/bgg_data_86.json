    "Description": "Humanity is dying, and there's no escaping it. Only a few hours remain before human existence wanes forever.&#10;&#10;The cause is still unknown, and no matter how you struggle, your life will soon come to an end. With only few hours until your departure, what are you going to do? A whirlwind of emotions rushes through you, and a glimpse of self-awareness blossoms. Will you be able to discover who you really are before The End?&#10;&#10;So Long, My World is a psychologial horror card game for 1-5 players, with a unique art style and immersive, emotive theme. It is the first board game that asks the players to think about their own death and its implications through a dreamlike, procedural narrative.&#10;&#10;So Long, My World is the first board game that brings philosophy to the table. In particular, it is based on existentialism, structuralism and psychoanalysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10;&#10;In Solo Mode, the player must fight against the cognitive disruption that is affecting every human being, trying to unlock Vision cards (memories and thoughts of people and places you may visit before the End) and prevent them from disappearing forever. Each turn, a previously unlocked Vision may become locked again. Each scenario has a specific setup with different sets of cards, conditions, and different endings. The more endings you achieve, the more Words (archetypical signifiers of human consciousness) you will discover, unlocking new powers and scenarios.&#10;&#10;In multiplayer, you choose amongst Vision cards in order to gather Feelings (in the form of tokens) and use them to discover your true self by playing Remnant cards from your hand. Remnant Cards can change a person's heart or alter the perception of time, so use them wisely to hinder, or even help your opponents.&#10;&#10;Is morality universal or a mere construct?&#10;If nobody can remember of you, has life a purpose?&#10;If soul has its place inside of my body, does it means that the soul is a physical being?&#10;&#10;These are only a few of the many questions the players will face.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Corsairs is essentially a card game where players attempt to assemble the correct combination of provisions in order to be able to board galleys, whilst possessing a strong enough crew in order to board the ship and fend off their opponents potential counterattacks. The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.&#10;&#10;Players are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:&#10;&#10;a) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. &#10;b) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile&#10;c) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.&#10;&#10;Once a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley. A new galley is then made available.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with most VP from galleys boarded.&#10;&#10;(precis from the review by gschloesser)&#10;&#10;",

You're pretty sure that's not what &quot;silent film&quot; means. Somehow, you'll need to rework all this into a movie that makes sense. But with the animation budget quickly running out, there's little room for error...&#10;&#10;The cameras are rolling on our newest blockbuster: Moving Pictures! This cooperative game for 2 players was designed by Chris Klimowski and is sure to be a big hit.&#10;&#10;In Moving Pictures players take turns placing numbered scene cards from their hand into the shared Timeline row in hopes of getting all 6 cards in order. The catch? They can't speak or signal to each other, so they'll have to watch each other's play closely for clues. Each card also has an effect listed which can impact placement, swap cards around, or even allow players a rare opportunity to share information.&#10;&#10;Getting it right once is a feat in itself but a full game of Moving Pictures is played over 3 Acts. The Timeline grows with each Act, making each round harder than the one before. Thankfully you also have access to 2 Deleted Scenes: if the round would end with scenes out of order, you can spend a Deleted Scene to hide one card. These Deleted Scenes don&rsquo;t refresh, meaning that you only get 2 mistakes before the credits roll.&#10;&#10;",

A new cemetery must be built to handle the needs of London for the indefinite future, outside of the city limits - far enough away that growth won't be an issue. The only way to transport the deceased and their loved ones to the cemetery is by train. This new system needs to be designed and you and your fellow planners have been tasked with submitting proposals. The most successful design will be awarded the contract by the city and your name will be listed among the great planners of history.&#10;&#10;Each turn in London Necropolis Railway, you choose a card and take the two associated action discs. You then activate 1-3 of the actions on the card, spending the discs of the matching colors, to improve your London Terminus, the Brookwood Necropolis, and/or the Railway that connects the two. You need to manage your money, your staff, and make sure you can keep pace with your improvements in each section. In addition, you can spend action discs to improve the prestige of your system, in order to gain more points for your London improvements.&#10;&#10;Points come primarily from two areas: how prestigious you&rsquo;ve made the London Terminus and how well you've filled the Necropolis. After twelve rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sultans of Karaya will feel familiar to fans of Werewolf/Mafia in that players each have a secret role and (most of them) belong to one of two teams, each team having a specific way to win the game. The two teams are:&#10;&#10;&bull; Sultan and Guards (Loyalists) &ndash; to win, they must eliminate all the Assassins and have no more than two Slaves still in play, or the Sultan must survive for a round after being revealed.&#10;&bull; Assassins and Slaves (Rebels) &ndash; to win, they must kill the Sultan or have three Slaves seated adjacently with their identities revealed, in which case a slave revolution brings down the Sultan.&#10;&#10;The number of role cards in play equals one more than the number of players, with exactly one Sultan, as many Guards as Assassins (with at least one in play), and at least three Slaves in the mix. Zero to four neutral characters will also be in play, each unique and each with the ability to win with one team or the other. The Slave Driver, for example, wins with the Rebels if face-down when the round ends and wins with the Loyalists if face-up, while the Fortune Teller must correctly predict the winning team.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player secretly receives one role card, with one card placed face-down in the middle of the table. On a turn, a player can peek at another player's role card, switch/hide (if your role is face-down, switch cards with another player or the spare role card; if face-up, make other players hide their eyes, then secretly switch with any other face-down role card), or use a character action: Guards can detain other players, forcing them to lose their turn; Slaves try to bring about a revolution; Assassins can eliminate any player at the risk of a Guard intervening and killing them instead.&#10;&#10;The neutral characters have more complex actions. The Belly Dancer, for example, neutralizes adjacent Guards, preventing them from detaining others or warding off assassination &ndash; but only if she's revealed. (If she's revealed and using her powers, she's working for a Rebel win; otherwise she can stay hidden and score if the Loyalists win.) The Vizier can force another player to reveal himself and use his special action.&#10;&#10;Players on the winning team score one or two points depending on whether they were face-up &ndash; that is, working publicly for the cause &ndash; or face-down. At the end of a round, redeal all the role cards. The player with the most points after five rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Try to maneuver the ping-pong ball into your opponents goal by deftly applying just enough backspin and English to reflect off the sidewalls and around the barrier that separates you.  You have 5 attempts to get a goal, as long as the ball keeps returning to you.  But if you put too much speed on it, it'll fly off the other side as there's no backstop in this game, only side rails.  If you can manage to curl it all the way into your opponents 'end zone' and make it come back into the goal, you get two points.  But instead of taking a point, you can set up a blocker instead, to try to protect your goal.  Comes with each players yoke like ball holder and rubber shooting implement with a small wooden handle.  One of a kind designs from Charbanova Studio (home of Aaron Weissblum), each one is hand painted and unique.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to reach 10 Victory Points wins the game!&#10;&#10;Original Japanese description: &#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#138;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#139;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#186;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#143;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#128;&#148;&#231;&#171;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#136;&#145;&#230;&#133;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#186;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#171;3&#229;&#128;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#186;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#186;&#151;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;4&#229;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#179;&#168;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#186;&#151;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#186;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#191;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#153;&#144;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#168;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#179;&#168;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#175;3&#229;&#128;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#191;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#230;&#136;&#145;&#230;&#133;&#162;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zatre is short for Zahlen &amp; Treppen, numbers and steps. The publisher was obliged to replace the phrase &quot;scrabbling with numbers&quot; for &quot;dominoes for the 21st century&quot; on the box, but really it is just Scrabble with numbers. And very good for it, it is too. There are 121 tiles with 1-6 dots like a standard die or domino (20 of each number plus an extra 1). Players alternately draw and place 2 tiles on the board extending the pattern already laid. When you make a vertical or horizontal line that totals 10, 11 or 12 (12 is the limit), you score 1, 2 or 4 points accordingly on your game pad. Completing scoring lines on the pad gives a rising bonus and covering marked squares on the board gives you a doubling bonuses on your pad.&#10;&#10;Simple and quick, but surprisingly challenging when you get the idea. The idea being that you must keep an even, balanced score pad, scoring 10s and 11s, not just successive 12s. Easy to pick up, but it requires some effort to score well; spotting those opportunities to place one tile which scores each way, making sure you keep clocking up 10s, to turn into 11s or 12s. Luck does play a role, but good players consistently score highly game after game, so there must be something deeper at work.&#10;The publisher Perner maintains a website with play &amp; chat over the internet and there are several very active Zatre clubs in Germany, Austria &amp; Switzerland. Players results are scored on the ranking table on the website.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Zatre: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Kharkov: The Soviet Spring Offensive 12 May to 21 May 1942&quot;, is a brigade/Division level simulation of the Spring 1942 Soviet strategic offensive.&#10;&#10;The Second Battle of Kharkov or Operation Fredericus was an Axis counter-offensive in the region around Kharkov against the Red Army Izium bridgehead offensive conducted 12&ndash;28 May 1942, on the Eastern Front during World War II. Its objective was to eliminate the Izium bridgehead over Seversky Donets or the &quot;Barvenkovo bulge&quot; which was one of the Soviet offensive's staging areas. After a winter counter-offensive that drove German troops away from Moscow but depleted the Red Army's reserves, the Kharkov offensive was a new Soviet attempt to expand upon their strategic initiative, although it failed to secure a significant element of surprise.&#10;&#10;On 12 May 1942, both the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts under the command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko launched an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counter-offensive. After a promising start, the offensive was stopped on 15 May by massive airstrikes. Critical Soviet errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly raised forces, facilitated a German pincer attack on 17 May which cut off three Soviet field armies from the rest of the front by 22 May. Hemmed into a narrow area, the 250,000-strong Soviet force inside the pocket was exterminated from all sides by German armored, artillery and machine gun firepower as well as 7,700 tonnes of air-dropped bombs. After six days of encirclement, Soviet resistance ended as their troops were killed or taken prisoner.&#10;&#10;The battle was an overwhelming German victory, with 280,000 Soviet casualties compared to just 20,000 for the Germans and their allies. The German Army Group South pressed its advantage, encircling the Soviet 28th Army on 13 June in Operation Wilhelm and pushing back the 38th and 9th Armies on 22 June in Operation Fridericus II as preliminary operations to Case Blue, which was launched on 28 June as the main German offensive on the Eastern Front in 1942.&#10;&#10;Kharkov uses the Panzergruppe Guderian system. Situation on the Soviet counter-offensive in Summer 1942. Makes use of untried Soviet units - neither player knows their strength until they enter combat for the first time.

Two to four players start in a basement/fallout shelter which can lead out to several base locations or even through the tunnels to sewer grates throughout the transformable board. The survivors are trying to make it day to day in a world torn apart from the walking dead.&#10;&#10;As in any survival game, one needs food, guns, ammo, and more. Players go out into the wasteland and scavenge for supplies, or perhaps to find a new gun or melee weapon to fend off the next zombie attack. In addition to gathering supplies, each player forms and controls his own squad &ndash; and each squad works to fortify the bases. Your walls and barbed wire won&rsquo;t hold the dead for long, however, and they&rsquo;re getting hungry.&#10;&#10;Characters receive victory points for killing zombies, building defenses, and successfully completing goals. Victory points show who is soldiering on the best in this wasteland. The final tally of points determines the winner. Victory points also act as experience points for leveling up a character.&#10;&#10;The game combines combat, tactics, resource collecting, character development, team play, and strategy towards the goal of surviving in the Zpocalypse!&#10;&#10;",

The game begins with the massive Soviet offensive that led to the encirclement of the city of Velikiye Luki by the forces of the Red Army's Kalinin Front against the Wehrmacht's 3rd Panzer Army during the Winter Campaign of 1942&ndash;1943 with the objective of liberating the Russian city of Velikiye Luki as part of the northern pincer of the Rzhev-Sychevka Strategic Offensive Operation (Operation Mars).&#10;&#10;The game uses an impulse turn system. Frank Chadwick's impulse system was later adopted and used in such games as Korsun Pocket, Black Sea Black Death and others.

Take on the role of a mining company and compete for copper by casting miners and machines into what was known as the underground lottery. As the industry grows, so do the communities surrounding your mines. But every attempt to wrest copper from the ground hangs the fortunes of your company, and the lives of your miners, in the balance.&#10;&#10;In Copper Country, each player takes on the role of a unique mining company and competes to produce the most copper before it's all gone! To produce copper, players hire miners to work mine sites. Your miner's productivity is measured in shifts. Each shift, you reveal one card from the top of the production deck, then choose an outcome by playing capital card resources from your hand, placing your miner at risk, or both!&#10;&#10;Stake your claim by building company houses to increase your miners' loyalty and safety. Expand your mining empire by building shaft houses and hoist houses to increase your copper production.&#10;&#10;When a player produces copper, the byproduct &mdash; poor rock &mdash; is removed from the industry track and dumped onto the mine site, reducing shifts nearby for all players. As players remove more poor rock from the industry track, local businesses open their doors, historical events occur, and Copper Country enters new eras of production. The game ends when the last poor rock is dumped onto a mine site, depleting Copper Country's mineral wealth. The winner is the player who has produced the most copper!&#10;&#10;",

Can you as the Soviet player complete the destruction or can you as the German player survive the Soviet onslaught.&#10;&#10;Red Typhoon is a two player game following an IGO-UGO turn sequence with activation points controlling the movement and attack of each of your formations. This means that some units will not move or attack, some will just move or just attack and some will both move and attack. The players choices of how to use his activations is the most important decision in the game. Combat is fairly traditional with the additions that units are retreated by the attacking player and that retreated units are disrupted. Players able to take advantage of these two factors will be successful.&#10;&#10;The game starts with several large Soviet breakthroughs that the German player must skillfully plug and in certain situations counterattack. There are special rules for German panzers, Soviet Airborne and Partisans.&#10;&#10;First published as Panzer Korps 04: Red Typhoon in Command Magazine (Japan) #85 (Mar-Apr 2009)&#10;&#10;",

No, this is NOT a World at War series game, but it does take place in the universe created by World at War. This is pure, impulse-driven, tanks vs. tank, squad vs. squad, leader vs. leader, RPD vs. M60, Lock &lsquo;n Load system gaming.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll command a bucket of 1985-era weaponry on a Marc von Martial-drawn, mounted 22&quot; x 34&quot; historical map of Eisenbach and its immediate surroundings, including Bergengipfel and Klappebruck. Defend West Germany with Abrams tanks, ITOW anti-tank vehicles, Cobra attack helicopters, squads of American soldiers, leaders, snipers, heroes, M60 machine guns, Dragon guided missiles, A-10 attack aircraft, and much more. All rendered with the precision we have all come to expect from David Julien.&#10;&#10;Or, if you chose, attack the capitalists with T-80, T-72, T-64, and T-55 tanks (okay, you won&rsquo;t get far with the T-55s, but we had to include them), Hind helicopters, Soviet infantry, paratroopers, BMPs, and all their accoutrements of war - RPGs, RPKs, RPDs, you are free to do so.&#10;&#10;Included are rules for anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM), which are easily depleted, advanced armor, advanced sights (thermal and night), fixed wing air support, and much more. Yet, despite the new rules, we believe we have held true to our company&rsquo;s mantra of &quot;more game, less guff.&quot;&#10;&#10;Fight nine Mark H. Walker-designed scenarios that recount the first day of the war, from the first probes by Soviet infantry to the ultimate, desperate clash for the Eisenbach Bridge. This is the game for those of you who have wanted to get down on the streets, in the buildings, on the deck of the tanks, and fight the battles of Red Army, Red Storm Rising, Team Yankee, or even World at War: Eisenbach Gap.&#10;&#10;&#10;     A 34&quot; x 22&quot; mounted game map, depicting the city of Eisenbach, the Eisenbach River, and the nearby towns of Klappebruck and Bergengipfel.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Three sheets of counters, including over 100 vehicles...the most vehicles ever crammed into a Lock 'n Load game box.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Complete LnL rules, module rules, player aid cards, and nine scenario cards.   &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Dice...always the dice. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     An awesome box that keeps the inside in.

    "Description": "Once a year, Buffalo City goes beef crazy. Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.&#10;&#10;Which beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?&#10;&#10;Players have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!&#10;&#10;When a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.&#10;&#10;The game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish. Whoever has the most cows in the pastures wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Casino is a fishing standard deck playing card game based on the traditional Italian game Scopa.  It is one of the few card games played with all cards in a standard 52 card deck that can be dealt out evenly to 2, 3 or 4 players.&#10;&#10;Play starts with four cards to each player and four cards to the table.  Each numeral card is counted as its numerical value.  The aim is to capture cards laying on the table by playing a card from hand which matches in number a table card or the sum of several table cards (for example, a 2 and an 8 can be captured by a ten).  Cards can also be stacked, called a &quot;build&quot;, to be taken next turn only if you have that card in your hand to take it later, risking their capture by another opponent (for example, a 2 and an 8 can have a 10 stacked upon it, next turn you can take the pile with another 10 and so can an opponent, capturing four cards).  Face cards are captured by the same face card.&#10;&#10;Cards must be played onto the table, called &quot;trailing&quot;, if there is nothing to capture.  Picked up cards are accumulated in a pile to be counted at the end of the round.  Once all players four card hands are depleted four cards are again dealt to each player (only deal the table on the first hand of a deck).  This happens until the deck is spent.  Cards remaining on the table after the deck is spent are won by the last player to capture a card.   Scoring depends on the variant.&#10;&#10;Most commonly the points total 11.  Per the rules published at pagat.com the scoring is as follows.&#10;&#10;Most cards = 3 points&#10;Most spades = 1 point&#10;10 of Diamonds (&quot;Big Casino&quot;) = 2 points&#10;Deuce of Spades (&quot;Little Casino&quot;) = 1 points (also counted as a spade in Most Spades count)&#10;Each Ace = 1 point (4 points with the Ace of spades counting towards most spades).&#10;&#10;A total of 11 points per deck, shuffling the deck again and starting over playing to 21.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Anathema&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on the social party game Spyfall, DC Spyfall is an easy-to-learn party game that features bluffing, suspicion, probing questions, and clever answers. At the start of each round, players receive a secret card informing them of the group's location &mdash; one of twenty unique DC locations, including Arkham Asylum, the Daily Planet, the Hall of Justice, and S.T.A.R. Labs &mdash; except for one player who receives the Joker card instead. The Joker doesn't know where he is, but if he can figure out his location before his cover is blown, he wins the round!&#10;&#10;DC Spyfall includes a few twists on the Spyfall formula. Since Harley Quinn usually follows wherever the Joker goes, each round, one player may receive a location card with a Harley image; if they do, they try to feed the Joker player information about the location, even if they don't know that player&rsquo;s identity! If the Joker player guesses the location, the two collaborators each score points &mdash; unless the superheroes can turn the tables on them and determine who Harley is.&#10;&#10;The game includes two multiverse decks that contain eight different locations instead of only one, so players will be confused with some of the questions and answers. Keep in mind that no one at the table knows whether or not they are playing with a multiverse deck. An all-Joker deck gives each player a Joker card, which means that all questions and answers will be based on nothing more than whatever players collectively believe. As with the multiverse decks, you won't know you're playing with this deck until someone figures it out.&#10;&#10;Super power cards can give a player an ability for a round, such as being able to dodge a question, or require a player to modify their behavior; for example, Super Speed forces a player to answer a question in three words or less.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The basic game (Attack!) is a very simple game of expansion and conflict set in the World War 2 era. It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).&#10;&#10;There are three major sub-games in Attack!:&#10;1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.&#10;&#10;2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.&#10;&#10;3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire &quot;set&quot; (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of &quot;1&quot; that represents a region without any special economic value (just &quot;population&quot;).&#10;&#10;The units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.&#10;The map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa). The expansion contains the map of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Attack!: Expansion&#10;    Attack! Deluxe Expansion (Replaces Attack!

    "Description": "WestFront details the conflict between the Allies and  Germany during WWII between 1943-45. Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to try and break the other sides lines. Additional rules are included for amphibious invasions. Several scenarios cover every major point of the war. The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Western Europe and Italy printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is one section of the complete EuroFront series that covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    WestFront II: The War in Europe 1943-45 &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.&#10;&#10;As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!&#10;&#10;",

The game ends when any of the robots are completely eliminated or when the stack of the modules runs out, then the player with the most trophies wins.&#10;&#10;They were created for the show, so even after the apocalypse, the show must go on!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The IT company is staring Chapter 11 in the face. Its cost of operations is too high, its revenue too low. In a last ditch attempt, it is looking to hire a top tier business consultant to turn this around. Alas, there are many such persons claiming to be the best. To filter mere noise from the elite, the company has called upon the consultants with the most potential to share their business proposals - You are one such.&#10;&#10;Shake Up sits in a very rare tabletop genre: reverse deck-building or also known as a deck destruction game. Players each have their own deck of cards, which are completely identical decks since they represent the same employees of the same IT company. How each player handles the company will be different though, and that is where the better consultant will stand out. The first consultant to put the company into the green wins!&#10;&#10;Every turn players draw 4 cards from their own deck, and determine how to utilize those cards' abilities. Players are also allowed to perform a 'Lay Off' action, permanently removing an employee from the deck. While this may seem bad, it makes their deck more efficient in the style they want to build towards. They also save on that employee's salary, especially if it is a highly paid executive! Note however, that the higher ups usually have greater experience and better abilities. Starting off the game with some debt, players will slowly clear them away as well as make some profit through new business projects. How then do consultants interact in the game? Their sales folks can try to hustle the other team, messing up their rivals' business proposals! Of course, those same rivals will likely also have their own purchasing and accounting departments to protect themselves from red herring purchases.&#10;&#10;When does the game end? Each time a player's draw deck is emptied and recycled from its discard pile, she has a chance to call an Audit. When an Audit is called, that player counts her total revenue earned, then reduce it by the salary of all existing employees in her deck, as well as any unpaid loans. If it is still positive, she wins the game right away! Dare you call an Audit before your rival? Doing so is risky, since you either win the game right away or you gain more debt because you have to pay for wasting the auditors' time, putting you further from victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Deck-builders are a common genre and folks try to add more powerful and advanced cards into their deck, which is typically comprised of basic cards. In reverse deck-building however, players begin with fully powered-up decks. The problem is one where veteran deck-builders will be familiar with - having too thick a deck will make it inefficient. Throughout the game, players will try to cull cards that are not part of their chosen strategy.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Unbeknownst to the group, Kali's rhinoceros friend Mambo is eager to bump the group along to keep it moving, possibly pushing an explorer or two into the dung heaps that dot the land. Can you avoid getting a faceful of feces and being bumped by Mambo?&#10;&#10;To set up the game, one player places Mambo on a space on the track that circles the game board, then all of the explorer tokens placed in random order in front of it, then Kali placed at the head of the line. Place the dung heaps along the movement track with some space between them. Each player takes a set of movement cards that match the color of her explorer.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly chooses a movement card, then they reveal these cards simultaneously; someone also reveals the top movement card from Kali's deck. Whichever player has played the highest card moves her explorer token to the first unoccupied space in front of the group, then the player with the next highest card moves her token, and so on. If two or more players reveal the same number, only the one farthest back in the group moves; all other such explorers remain where they started the round. (Kali moves like an explorer. If you play a zero or are at the front of the group when you are supposed to move, you don't move.)&#10;&#10;If a player's token lands on a dung heap, she scores three penalty points. If Kali lands in the dung, the player(s) who played the lowest number that round take the penalty instead of Kali.&#10;&#10;Whenever Kali or an explorer token leave the space immediately in front of Mambo, the rhino charges, moving until it rams into the token in back of the line and giving that player as many penalty points as the number of spaces Mambo ran. If Mambo rams Kali, then as with the Kali/dung interaction, the player(s) who played the lowest number take the penalty points instead of Kali.&#10;&#10;Remove those played movement cards from the game. After twelve rounds &ndash; that is, after the final cards have been played and resolved, the game ends and the player with the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Tell your tales over a bottle of rum and impress your fellow pirates. Who will have the best tales to tell?!&#10;&#10;In Nassau each player represents a pirate crew trying to earn the most points during the course of the game. Nassau is played over 4 seasons with each season broken down into 2 phases.&#10;&#10;In the first phase players collect different items like: weapons, pirate pets, coins, rum, sails, and other stuff on the city game board to make their own ship stronger a prepare them for the second phase. You get those items by placing your pirates through a clever placement mechanism in the city of Nassau, that leaves enough room for tactical decisions.&#10;&#10;In the second phase it is time to test how good your crew and ship really is by sailing the seas and take on different adventures. Each action costs you a provision and depending on where you sail and what you do, you need weapons, canons, and ammunition. But beware, each weapon and canon must be manned by a pirate, so keep your balance. Pirate pets allow you to use special powers that can turn the tide of battle. At last, you must return to your home base, but not without telling tales of your adventures and earning points. The better the tale, the more points await.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In order to confuse the wolf, the hunter and animals in the farmhouse also start to disguise themselves. As a result, nobody can tell each other apart anymore. Meanwhile, the shepherd boy has repeatedly fooled others by crying out &quot;Wooolf! Wooolf!!&quot;. So the hunter and the hunting dog have to be careful with the shepherd boy. Everyone has to find out the real identity of others. Will the wolf finally catch the real sheep, or can the sheep find the hunter and the hunting dog who can protect them?&#10;&#10;Wooolf!! Is a fast playing deduction game suitable for four to eight players. Each player has two character cards, one of which represents his true identity and the other is only there to cause confusion. Character cards include wolf, sheep, shepherd boy, hunter, and hunting dog. By asking clever questions and drawing the right conclusions, each player tries to make correct suspicions before the other players do. In order to catch the wolf, the shepherd boy will sometimes dress up as hunter, the hunter will disguise as a sheep, the sheep will act like hunting dogs and the hunting dog will put on wolf skin. Use your wits to tell truth from lies in order to be the first to catch the wolf.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Convicted is a cooperative board game for 1-4 players. Fight for survival in a hostile land, expand your town and stand ground against continuous surge of enemies!&#10;&#10;In The Convicted players become convicts who were given a second chance to expiate their crimes. In order to prove their devotion, they need to colonize new lands in the name of the king. They start building their headquarters &ndash; town &ndash; with just a handful of footman, and a few structures. Through the development of fortifications, buildings, researching new technologies, gathering resources and training recruits they can transform their colony into an impenetrable fortress. Alas, the new world is full of indigenous inhabitants who by any means possible try to get rid of unwanted colonizers. Countless hordes of barbarians, forest people, ferocious monsters and wolf men with their beasts and war machines will spare no effort to storm the town and its defenders. The whole game-play consists of a campaign of 20 turns, ~45 minutes each (15 hours total). The use of random opponent selections and attack directions makes each game a unique experience.&#10;&#10;",

One umbrella of each color starts in a &quot;waiting zone&quot; to your left and right (with these being shared with the players sitting in those directions), a &quot;waiting zone&quot; in the center of play (shared by all players), and a &quot;waiting zone&quot; below your personal game board (shared by no one else). Start with two stacks of two figure tiles on your game board. Each figure tile shows you an arrangement of umbrellas in a single color that you want to create on your board.&#10;&#10;On a turn, take an umbrella from an adjacent waiting zone, then slide it onto your game board from the direction of that area, pushing out an umbrella into the waiting zone on the opposite side. If you've created a unicolor umbrella arrangement that matches a visible figure tile on your board, place a scoring token on an empty space of the matching color on your scoreboard, then pass the figure tile to the player on your left; they place this tile on their board in the first empty figure space, rotating the tile to match the depicted orientation.&#10;&#10;Continue taking turns in clockwise order until a player has no figure tiles in front of them, a player has ten scoring tokens on their scoreboard, or a player empties the pool of scoring tokens by taking the final one. Each other player takes one turn, then everyone scores their points: 2 points per scoring token, a variable number of points for groups of tokens (which differs per scoreboard), and points based on the number of umbrellas in their personal waiting zone.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn is divided in a varying number of impulses, during which both players always have the opportunity to react to their opponent&rsquo;s moves, alternating within an extremely flexible game structure.&#10;&#10;When a turn starts, each player gets a certain amount of activation points he can use to put under command his forces during impulses. These formations, single divisions or whole army corps, once activated, can move and fight, move strategically in a different sector, can be put in reserve and so on.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;Activation points can also be used for other operations: air cover, landings, strengthening defensive lines, recon, ULTRA, etc.&#10;&#10;Artillery has a very important role in the game; it can perform various missions: bombardment, interdiction, tactical support. Aircraft perform the same kind of missions too, but with a much longer range.&#10;&#10;The activation point system creates great uncertainty in the game, so every game plays out differently: players must carefully plan their strategy and constantly make fundamental decisions. It is a game of great tension and depth, where desperate counter-attacks alternate with strategic surprises; the attention of players must always be constant.&#10;&#10;Other detailed rules cover: combat, breakthroughs, artillery, reserves, reinforcements, replacements, naval support, supply in mountainous terrain and flat land and, of course, victory conditions.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;&#10;The German player has obviously a chance to win the game right away if he manages to repel the US 5th Army in Salerno.&#10;&#10;If the German player does not win, the game goes on, and the Allies must conquer Rome, trying to eliminate the armies of the Axis powers, in order to win. The Axis wins if the Allies do not reach their victory conditions or if, in any moment, the losses for the Allies go over a certain level. 'The Kesserling&rsquo;s Option' variant changes the game completely, giving back the initiative to the Axis player and changing the victory conditions again.&#10;&#10;(description from the publisher and BGG user)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Crown of Roses is a 3-hour block game set during the turbulent years of the Wars of the Roses in 15th Century England. This 35-year long conflict saw the extinction of a large number of noble houses, and would eventually set the house of Tudor upon the throne.&#10;&#10;In Crown of Roses, players take on the roles of the dynastic giants - the House of Lancaster and their Beaufort cousins, and the House of York. The four player game adds in the powerful House of Stafford, and the ever-scheming Richard Neville and his son, Richard of Warwick, the 'Kingmaker'.&#10;&#10;Using intuitive mechanics, Crown of Roses offers players a historical feeling with tremendous strategic depth and excellent replayability. Unit starting locations vary with each turn and even with each game, and the use of blocks creates the &quot;fog of war&quot; of limited intelligence on enemy strength and deployment. Random game events throw a touch of the chaos of the era into the mix, and the multiple uses for the player action cards leads to a level of uncertainty where enemy plans are concerned.&#10;&#10;During each game turn in Crown of Roses, players will play cards to perform actions such as improving their armies, influencing the locals to support them, collecting supplies or prestige, moving to attack enemy forces, to recruit new houses to your cause, calling another Royal Heir into the fray, or even changing the nature of the conflict through the use of player events.&#10;&#10;Unit blocks rotate to show strength, and each army can have a variety of experience levels and combat capabilities. A novel roll to hit-based system is used to determine combat results, with better experienced forces scoring hits more often in battle. Kill all of the enemy heirs, and you can rule England unimpeded!&#10;&#10;In Parliament, players can try to gain a favorable posting or take control of the crown itself by gathering enough noble support. Gather enough votes for enough years and the nobles of parliament will welcome you as their sovereign!&#10;&#10;And if you can create enough influence with the local gentry, your economic might will sway the common folk to support you as their chosen monarch!&#10;&#10;And the four player game of Crown of Roses allows all of this and more without the sacrifice of the unique fog of war aspect that the unit blocks provide. With each player having up to three ways to win, who knows who will be the next King of England!&quot;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE Variable&#10;&#10;MAP SCALE Area Movement&#10;&#10;UNIT SCALE Noble houses and mercenary factions&#10;&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS  Two to Four&#10;&#10;DEVELOPERS: Andy Young and Kevin Bernatz&#10;ART DIRECTOR/PACKAGING: Rodger B.

    "Description": "The object of HeartSwitch &ndash; a card game inspired by Hearts &ndash; is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. The sixty-card deck consists of the standard 52-card deck, plus four Magicians and four Witches, two good and two bad, with Witches ranking between Jacks and Tens.&#10;&#10;As in Hearts, HeartSwitch is a trick-taking game with fairly standard rules. The lead player plays a single card, then each other player must follow suit, if possible &ndash; except that a player can always choose to play a Magician. A Magician is a null card that can never win a trick (unless a trick consists only of Magicians). Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led collects the cards, then leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;After everyone's hand is empty, players score points for the cards they've collected. As in Hearts, each heart collected is one point, while the Queen of Spades is 13 points. What's new in &quot;HeartSwitch&quot; is that the Witch of Spades is worth 5 points, while the Witch of Clubs cancels points earned for either of the Spades cards. The Witch of Hearts doubles points earned from hearts up to a maximum of 15 points, while the Witch of Diamonds knocks up to 5 points off your score. If a player &quot;shoots the moon&quot; by collecting all the hearts and either the Witch or Queen of Spades (or both), that player scores no points while everyone else scores 20, 25 or 30 points.&#10;&#10;Players continue playing rounds until one player reaches 70 points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins. Alternatively, players can agree to play a set number of rounds, with the lowest-scoring player winning the game.&#10;&#10;",
