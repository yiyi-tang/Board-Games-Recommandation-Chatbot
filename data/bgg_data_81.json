    "Description": "&quot;Without teamwork, you will never survive. Without betrayal, you'll never win.&quot;&#10;&#10;An artifact of untold power lies in your hands. To claim it, you must escape the caverns alive. No less than nine horrific beasts stand in your way &mdash; that, and the greed of the other players. In the kill-stealing game Cutthroat Caverns, you decide whether to swing for a whopping 50 points of damage or hold back, awaiting a more opportune time to strike. Only the final blow matters if you are to score the kill. Hold back or sabotage other's plans too much, and the entire party will die without a winner. The adventurers jockey for position during combat with their lives and their own selfish desire for power in the balance, so things get very funny and very deadly very quickly.&#10;&#10;Cutthroat Caverns: Anniversary Edition is a complete reboot of the well-known semi-co-operative game Cutthroat Caverns, with the game experience being updated in significant ways. Enhanced encounters, epic finish rules, scaling play times, enhanced components, updated cards, rules and keywords to streamline play and a ground up re-envisioning of the illustrations and graphics are all among the updates you can look forward to in this anniversary edition of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Also available on mobile devices&#10;&#10;iOS&#10;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cutthroat-caverns/id1436417431&#10;&#10;Android&#10;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cellblocstudios.cutthroatcavernsmobile&#10;&#10;",

Each morning the Grade Ones arrive with rocks they've gathered, then haul away the rocks that you don't need anymore &ndash; but there aren't enough Grade One initiates to go around, so there will be competition for the best selection of rocks. The Grade Ones will give their new rocks to whoever gives them the fewest old rocks to haul away.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind while creating your garden, however, that certain combinations of rocks must be avoided! Every afternoon, the Feng Shui Masters come by to check your work. You'll receive demerits for any forbidden combinations &ndash; but you'll also receive demerits for your laziness if you don't add new stones each day, so you must find a balance.&#10;&#10;The Masters' final evaluation will come with no advance warning. The Initiate who has the fewest demerits will advance to Grade Three, while the one with the most demerits will be kicked down to Grade One, joining the others in the daily search for new rocks...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Contents - one deck of 102 Gargon cards in 6 suits, plus 18 bonus cards. One rulebook.&#10;&#10;Gargon is fantasy themed card game for 3-5 players. There are 6 suits of Gargon cards, each representing a fantasy creature, with values 0 to 15. The cards also show amulet symbols, with the low value cards having more, the highest value cards having none. At the end of the game, the player who has won the most cards in each suit gets a bonus card worth ten points, or five points if tied - this is what the 18 bonus cards are for. Each amulet is also worth one point. The zero value cards have no amulets themselves, but double the amulet count for that suit, or quadruple them if both 0 value cards in that suit have been won.&#10;&#10;Ten cards are dealt to each player, and the rest are split into two equal draw piles, face down, in the center of the board. The draw piles are spread out so that the backs can be seen, showing the color of the suits. Players must also hold their cards so that the backs are visible.&#10;&#10;Each round the start player plays up to three cards face down, (but never three of the same suit), and the other players must follow in turn with the same number of cards in the same distribution, or pass. There is no requirement to follow suit in general, but if, for example, the start player puts down three cards in three different suits, the other players must also play three cards in three different suits. The last player is restricted to suits that have already been played. Anybody who passed draws 1-3 cards from the two draw piles in the center. A battle is then resolved for each suit that has been played, with the highest card winning the battle and going into its owner&rsquo;s stash of Gargon cards to be scored at the end. The losing cards are discarded and the players draw replacements.&#10;&#10;If anybody played two cards of a suit, a second battle is fought with the weakest of the pair.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the draw piles is exhausted, and the current round is played out, then the totals are scored.&#10;&#10;",

Players take two actions each round, one action at a time in turn order, with each action using two dice. Players will use one die to move and one die to activate the location to which they moved.

    "Description": "In Pocket Madness, you'll meet nice people like Shub-Niggurath, visit lovely places like Innsmouth, and cross the path of friendly creatures such as the Shoggoths.&#10;&#10;Pocket Madness is a fast-paced card game inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, known worldwide for his short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;. In the game, you evoke the powers of the Ancient Ones to drive your fellow cultists mad while securing your path to victory. To play, you first deal each player two cards from a deck that contains cards numbered 6-12, then you count out 17 face-down cards, flip the remainder face up, shuffle the deck, then lay it out in a row so that all players can see the cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either take 1-3 cards, open a portal, or open an investigation. When you take card, you pick up the first 1-3 cards in the row, then add them to your hand. To open a portal, you lay down three or more cards of the same type, then take the portal matching the number on those cards. Each portal has a different power, and you can use any one portal power on your turn. If someone else claims a portal that you own, too bad! You just lost the portal! To open an investigation, discard cards numbered 6-12, after which every other player gains as many madness tokens as the number of investigations this round.&#10;&#10;A round ends when one player runs out of cards or the card row runs out. In the latter case, everyone takes one final turn, then all players gain madness tokens equal to the number of different types of cards in their hand. If a player empties their hand, that player loses half of their madness tokens while everyone else gains one.&#10;&#10;The game ends the round that a player has collected ten or more madness tokens.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;History&rsquo;s best-known naval battle was just one part of the ongoing four-year struggle to control the seas around Germany&rsquo;s coasts. If the German High Seas Fleet could catch and destroy a portion of the much larger British Grand Fleet, the blockade suffocating Imperial Germany might finally be broken.&#10;&#10;Great War at Sea: Jutland is an extensively updated version of the earlier GWAS Vol. II: The North and Baltic Seas published in 1998. It covers not only the signature battle, but also the many other sorties of the High Seas Fleet like the Scarborough, Lowestoft and Gorleston Raids, the Battle of Dogger Bank and Helgoland Bight.&#10;&#10;Like all games in the Series: Great War at Sea (Avalanche Press) series, this one is packed with scenarios. Along with the operations in the North Sea, the game also includes the bitterly-fought naval war in the Baltic Sea. Here the roles are reversed, with the smaller Imperial Russian Navy aggressively seeking an advantage against the larger German forces. The Russian cruiser raids are all covered, as well as the climactic Battle of Moon Sound.&#10;&#10;The scenario book includes not only more than 40 scenarios, it&rsquo;s packed with the background information about the ships, the men and the battles.&#10;&#10;The map covers the North and Baltic Seas, as well as the waters around the British Isles; it&rsquo;s a bit larger than the map in the previous edition. The smaller navies of the region are all represented as well: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands.&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s the major powers that get most of the ships. The Royal Navy is huge, with ships ranging from ancient paddle-driven minesweepers to modern battle cruisers like Repulse and Renown. Famous ships like the battleships Dreadnought and Iron Duke, the inaptly-named battle cruiser Invincible, and early aircraft carriers like Engadine and Argus are all here.&#10;&#10;The German High Seas Fleet has all the ships that challenged England, from the tiny coast defense ship Siegfried up to the huge battleships Sachsen and W&uuml;rttemburg. The Germans have zeppelins and submarines to help redress the balance somewhat, but it will take skilled play to overcome Britain&rsquo;s sea dogs.&#10;&#10;Russia has modern dreadnoughts, but will depend on her armored cruisers and a squadron of older battleships for most missions.&#10;&#10;As with other games in the series, the tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.&#10;&#10;&#10;     32 miles/sea zone campaign scale&#10;     420 1-inch counters, 420 1/2-inch counters&#10;     34&quot; x 22&quot; operational map&#10;     24&quot; x 24&quot; tactical map&#10;     16 page rules, 128 page scenario book&#10;&#10;&#10;",

For reasons still unknown, right before the attack the German 9th Army ordered three battalions the GD Division to move to the Luchessa Valley as OKH reserve, thus backing up the weak 216th Grenadier Regiment. Because of the presence of the GD, the Soviets were unable to force a breakthrough and decided to commit the 3rd Mech Corps into the meat grinder to force the issue...&#10;&#10;Designer Wig Graves conducted extensive research, combing both German and Soviet sources to create the order of battle. The Soviets begin with seemingly overwhelming force, while the Germans trade space for time and attempt to rush reinforcements to the front to plug inevitable gaps. While the Germans are primarily on the defense, careful counter-attacks against the relatively immobile Soviet formations can prove to be key to victory. And if the Soviets do not preserve their forces carefully, they will end with the historical result: stable German lines and an entire mechanized corps wrecked.&#10;&#10;GD &rsquo;42 uses the new Tactical Combat Series rules.

Tricks are must-follow. Players win one point per trick, and any points on the cards in the trick. Four hands are played, and the team with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In the advanced variant, three cards are added: the King and two Spies. The King card is the highest trump.&#10;&#10;King Henry pursued Anne Boleyn for almost seven years before they were married. Those loyal to Catherine of Aragon did not accept Anne Boleyn, and considered King Henry&rsquo;s first wife the rightful Queen. Those loyal to Anne Boleyn saw her as the future, the young wife who would surely give the King a son.&#10;&#10;The zero cards are spies, lowly servants that go unnoticed, working to undermine the rival side. They come in black (for Catherine of Aragon) and red (for Anne Boleyn),  but may reveal themselves as the 13 of the opposite suit.&#10;&#10;There is also The Church of England, which is given to the team with fewer points after scoring. Once per hand, it can annul a trick that does not contain the King.&#10;&#10;",

When you look at your clients' enthusiastic faces, you know that their lives are in your hands.&#10;&#10;In Mount Everest players take control of a team of two expert mountaineers who must lead as many tourists as they can to the peak and, of course, safely bring them back. Each player gets an identical deck of cards that are used for moving around the board. Players must decide where to set up camps and how much oxygen to bring to the top; only oxygen lets players get acclimatization cards, which allow tourists to survive the climb. Players must also decide what type of customers they want: the athletic, fairly competent climbers, or the wealthier and more prestigious amateurs. Climbing with one tourist in tow is easy, but the key to victory lies in guiding whole groups. Unfortunately, the more people you take with you, the higher the likelihood is of something going wrong. Also, as it is in the mountains, the weather will be a crucial factor. If a player can coordinate an expedition that avoids a crisis at the peak, he should be able to lead the happy tourists back to base.&#10;&#10;Who will become the best Himalayan guide?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Milan, early 20th century, the city is in turmoil as more than 200 new buildings are rushed to being completed in time for welcoming the best minds of the planet. The 1906 Universal Exposition is approaching and, as one of the 40 exhibiting nations, you are confident that your engineers and scientists will impress the world. Who will exhibit the most impressive technological advancements? Which energy source will prevail: the majestic power of Steam or the more elegant and efficient Electricity? Can you prevail in prestige and glory against the other competing nations?&#10;&#10;In Expo 1906, players will win by totaling more prestige points at the end of the game than their opponents. Points are awarded for completing Projects which represent historical inventions of the period. To complete a Project, a player must purchase Resources and place them in a proper combinations together with a Project in his Laboratory. This is a challenging task as Projects come in many different shapes and must fit together with their resources in an already tight space. Soon the available room in the Laboratory will reduce and players will face the puzzle solving aspect of the game.&#10; Strategy plays an important role too: to speed up the completion of a Project players can acquire Technologies, which can either reduce the number of Resources required to complete a Project or enhance the type of actions at their disposal. This will require careful management of the available space in their Laboratory too. Also, by registering ideas at the Patents'Office players can become leader in the development of specific Resources and accumulate more prestige points when completing Projects. Setting priorities between all these actions will become critical as players rush to prepare in time for the upcoming World Exposition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Littoral Commander (formerly Fleet Marine Force) is a 2-6 player boardgame about potential military conflict in the Indo-Pacific region, a hybrid of standard hex and counter wargames and card-driven games. Players spend Action Points (AP) during their turn to activate cards or move units on the game board. The game was originally designed for professional military education, but has been adapted for commercial release.&#10;&#10;The units in the game represent current and future project capabilities for the US Marine Corps / US Navy and the Chinese Navy and Marine Corps (PLAN/PLANMC). The gameplay emphasizes coordination within teams to successfully find and engage the enemy through both kinetic (like missiles) and non-kinetic (like cyber) means. Over 200+ Joint Capability Cards (JCCs) represent a wide range of joint and adversary capabilities. This includes cyber-attacks, influence operations, bomber strikes, submarines, key enablers, and more.&#10;&#10;The system highlights the importance of reconnaissance, long-range strike, logistics, and cyber capabilities in modern combat. It is designed as an accessible and modular system for both experienced and new players.&#10;&#10;The game features a scenario system, where players can play on four different maps: Luzon, Taiwan, Straits of Malacca, and Okinawa. Players can play one of the baseline scenarios provided, but are also encouraged to adapt and create their own scenarios for the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Stones prevent fish from entering a space and are best placed to block an opponent's path to a meal. Frogs are delicious 1 VP meals all their own, but they also eat dragonflies in adjacent spaces, so often they are placed to deprive opponents of their dinner.&#10;&#10;As the weather changes and a new event card is revealed for the day in KOI, so must your strategy change.

    "Description": "Campaign Commander Volume I: Roads to Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;&quot;Roads to Stalingrad&quot; is the first volume of the Campaign Commander Series and depicts the campaign in southern Russia from the summer of 1942 to the end of the winter of 1943. After a terrible first winter in Russia, the German troops reorganized and readied themselves to launch the offensive to end the war. The soviets got ready first; they launched an attack to retake Kharkov that ended in disaster for the troops involved. After finishing this offensive the Axis forces - numbering many Hungarians, Romanians and Italians - launched, at the beginning of July 1942 the operation code named &quot;Case Blue&quot;. German advance seemed unstoppable, reaching the Caucasus and the banks of the river Volga. At the city of Stalingrad the German army would experience a real nightmare fighting through August to October in an attempt to conquer it. Control of the city meant that the Germans could cut the traffic along the Volga, while for the Soviets it became a symbol of resistance against the invaders. Both Stalin and Hitler sent more and more troops to the cauldron of that destroyed city, into the fiercest and bloodiest battle ever known in history. In the event, conquering the city was rather useless to the Germans since, beginning on the 19th of November, Operation Uranus was launched and Marshall Zhukov could trap the German 6th Army into the ruins just won. Successive soviet offensives destroyed the Italian, Romanian and Hungarian armies on the river Don, forcing the Germans to evacuate their conquests in the Caucasus and endangering even the survival of the whole German Army Group South. Only the timely intervention of Marshall Erich von Manstein allowed the Germans to stop the Soviet advance and stabilize the front, thus saving an already catastrophic situation.&#10;&#10;The game is played at the operational level - with a zonal map at a 1:120000 scale. Designed for two players, one handles the Axis while the other commands the Soviets. The game has an estimated playing time of 3-4 hours and uses a double system of counters/map and cards in its mechanics. Players must use appropriately their troops and resources to obtain victory points either by destroying enemy forces or by occupying cities on the map. This is not a card driven game, cards are used for causing certain events, influence the outcome of battles and to place on map the necessary resources and reinforcements to fight on.&#10;&#10;The game starts in summer, the Axis player has the initiative and will mercilessly and relentlessly pound the Soviets. The Soviet player will have to hope for the winter - a card to be played given certain conditions - to stop the Axis advance and defeat them.&#10;&#10;As the other titles in the series, this game has very simple rules and has been designed to make games wholly interactive, creating a solid and enjoyable experience for those who simply cannot find the time and space to play a longer and more complex game.&#10;&#10;The Axis player must face the historical disjunctive, should he concentrate on taking the Caucasus, Stalingrad or both? The Soviet player will have to be patient and force his enemy to overextend his resources, at the same time managing to accumulate forces for a lethal winter offensive.&#10;&#10;",

Players will use three different characters; the Viking, the Shaman, and the Explorer to lead their clan and expand their kingdom. The game is played over the Norse calendar year and each clan is preparing for the harsh winter. Players will enjoy the light interaction by exploring for cards and conquering nearby lands. Once winter is over the game ends and the player with the most Victory Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Winterborne has multiple paths to victory and each player can decide the best route based on card collection, expanding and settling, or trading with allies. Each path provides a rich and enjoyable play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The player who collects 10 Power tokens, wins.  In a world without gods, only you may claim your destiny.&#10;&#10;During the game, a general and a dragon entering to the same region peacefully, have a chance of becoming Dragonbonded to unlock a unique ability that interacts with each other, and playing as a team for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;In the planning phase players secretly play action cards in a face-down pile to program their actions across the board until one player passes; in the resolution phase, actions are resolved in order. Through these actions, players move to different regions, attack, collect power or cast spells by spending the Power collected.&#10;&#10;Combat has a wargame feel into it due to the dice-based resolution with critical hits, counterattacks and retreats. If Power is scarce on the board, you can steal a Power token from another player entering into combat and dealing more hits than they can take.&#10;&#10;Dragons and generals play entirely different in strategy and actions. Generals raise armies and customize them in different regions around the board to control them and harvest Power. Dragons can gain Power by devouring units, they also have a health track and must rest and recover if they get wounded too much. All characters in the game have a unique Vaala deck of spells.&#10;&#10;-description from developer&#10;&#10;",

For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone with which you can receive text messages.

    "Description": "Unlock your past. Experience the nightmare. Embrace the dawn.&#10;     &#10;You have awoken in a world that can't possibly exist. Everywhere you look you see some fresh nightmare; some new perversion of reality. You don't remember how you got here. In fact, your mind feels as though it has shattered, its fractured memories scattered in the wind. Despite this, you see hints of your past all around you, glimmers of the familiar tormenting you amidst the twisted, fluctuating landscape. What's worse, though, is that as you stumble through this place you realize you are not alone. There are monstrous, impossible beings shuffling and slithering and skittering toward you, hideous beyond all comprehension. Their most disturbing aspect, however, isn't the abject terror they exude. It's that you recognize them.&#10;&#10;It's not long before you discover there are other people here, too, wandering through this fever dream with you. They seem as lost, as scared, and as broken as you are. If you want to survive this place and escape, then you will have to band together with them, setting aside your differences and distrust to push back the oncoming torrent of seething corporeal chaos. Because otherwise you won't just die: your very essence will cease to exist.&#10;&#10;Dawn of Madness is a story-driven cooperative game of survival horror for 1-4 players. Set in the same universe as the breakout hit board game Deep Madness, Dawn of Madness is a completely standalone, unique, and terrifying gaming experience. During the game players will assume the role of wanderers trapped in a feverish hellscape, surrounded by the distorted echoes of their own history. As one of these wanderers, you must seek to discover what led you to this horrific world, struggling to survive as your and your fellow players' stories unfold across multiple chapters in an ongoing campaign. &#10;   &#10;Experience true horror unlike any board game before as you are immersed in stories of terror and madness, using the amplified powers of your mind to survive and fight back against the encroaching aberrations out to devour you. Bind your consciousness to other players' in order to accomplish difficult tasks, and earn coda cards and memories to boost your abilities while uncovering your past. All the while you will be gathering story points toward one of the multiple endings for each wanderer, and in the campaign's epic finale the wanderer - and the ending - with the most story points will spawn their respective terrifying, relentless final boss.  &#10;    &#10;The choices made throughout a chapter - and even the order those choices are made in - influence almost every aspect of the game, ensuring that no playthrough will ever be exactly the same. Adding even more variety, danger, and tension are the chapter-agnostic mini bosses and their distortions who plague each game in unique and changing ways, summoning vortexes of energy to alter the course of play and bring fresh dangers with every round. And all these challenges don't even include the malformations: alternate versions of the wanderers themselves, each one increasingly more corrupt than the one before, and each one able to take players into the darkest recesses of their comrades' souls. &#10;      &#10;Hearkening back to survival-horror classics like Silent Hill, The Evil Within, and Alan Wake, Dawn of Madness is a mind-bending, psychological experience unlike any other attempted in a board game. So gather your wits and steel your nerves for a trip into other universes and the depths of the human consciousness. Sometimes, the greatest horrors of all lie within.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Fulda Gap and includes the major West German cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.&#10;&#10;Fifth Corps uses a collection of mechanics, including &quot;Operations Points&quot; and &quot;Friction Points&quot;, variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare. The game includes three scenarios: an introductory &quot;Rhein-Main Raid&quot;, a more advanced &quot;The Battle for Fulda&quot;, and the campaign game, &quot;Fifth Corps&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Rhein-Main Raid Scenario: Three days after the next war began, the Soviets had not crossed into the Fulda/Frankfurt area. All Warsaw Pact lines of advance had been to the north and south of Fifth Corp's area of operations.Thus, NATO vacated the area to reinforce other hard hit sectors. NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap. Here an entire Soviet Army and various support units, including an airborne regiment, were committed on the first day... Those [NATO support units] that survived were ordered to &quot;contain all enemy breakouts&quot; until the arrival of the 5th Panzer Division.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fifth Corps Scenario: Following the initial attack by 8th Guards Army, the Soviets sought to seal the fate of NATO in the Fulda/Frankfurt area by committing the 1st Guards Tank Army to the action... The race was on for the important Pomcus and Reforger sites.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

(The twelve categories are book, film/TV, music/song, famous person, generic person, shape/color, number, matter, item, place, animal, and verb.) They then set down a square of nine (3x3) category tiles on the table (including the one she just drew). In turns, other players choose a category. If it matches the word to be guessed, the &quot;Master of Mysteries&quot; says so and sets the tile aside; if not, they must either give a clue matching this category, then flip the tile (which cannot be chosen again), or discard the tile and place it back in the bag. At the end of each turn, the active player can make one guess, and if their answer is right, both the guesser and the Master of Mysteries scores as many points as the number of non-discarded tiles chosen  during that round.&#10;&#10;After a clue has been given or a tile discarded, any player can interrupt the game by saying they know the answer. Any other players can then do the same. Then, in clockwise order, each of them gives one answer, and either wins this round or is eliminated until next round.&#10;&#10;After a certain number of rounds (depending on the number of players), the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The latest game in the tradition of Napoleon's Last Battles and Four Lost Battles will cover Napoleon's 1809 Danube Campaign. Like the other games players command the forces of Napoleon or the Coalition on a hex map covering three battles. Cards activate units and cause events to occur. The scale will be 525 yards (480 meters) per hex, 1 hour per turn, 500-800 men per strength point.&#10;&#10;The Battles Simulated:&#10;Abensberg, April 19-20&#10;Eckm&uuml;hl, April 21-22&#10;Aspern-Essling, May 21-22&#10;Wagram, July 5-6&#10;3 maps, 2 counter sheets, 2 card decks, etc.&#10;&#10;Abensberg and Eckm&uuml;hl are each playable as single-map battle games as well as a two-map game of the double battle. Aspern-Essling and Wagram are played on the same map. Hence there are four separate battles in this package, played on a total of 3 full-sized maps. Campaign Game options link the four battles.&#10;&#10;An Additional bonus scenario was added at the last moment as the game went into production: The Battle of Teugen-Hausen, April 19.&#10;&#10;Part of the &quot;Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG)&quot;-Series - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB)-Series&quot;&#10;&#10;",

In each hand, one player bids to be Chimera and the other two players team up as the Chimera Hunters to defeat this player. Players compete for points in several hands of play, and the winner is the player who scores the most points once the designated point score is reached by one or more players. Chimera is normally played to 400 points, although longer or shorter games may be played. Chimera for three players was previously published as Chimera by ZMAN Games.&#10;&#10;Chimera for five players plays similarly to Chimera for three players, but with additional cards and rules. One player bids to be Chimera, then chooses one other player to be their partner (the Pi Ya) through a bid system; the other three players then team up as the Chimera Hunters to defeat them. Chimera for five players is normally played to 400 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Codex Leicester is the reimplementation of Leonardo da Vinci (2006) by Acchittocca  (Flaminia Brasini, Virginio Gigli, Stefano Luperto, Antonio Tinto) in collaboration with the founder of DiceTree Games, Changhyun Baek. It is a new game using the original&rsquo;s system and theme.&#10;&#10;This is a worker placement game for 1 to 5 players, featuring strong player interaction. Playtime lasts approximately 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;Summary:&#10;Players find themselves as inventors trying to breathe life into their designs, all of which draw their inspiration from the notes of the master himself:  the Codex Leicester of Leonardo da Vinci. Ranging from relatively simple to epic, all these inventions require materials and time to bring them to fruition.&#10;Of course, genius alone won&rsquo;t get the job done. Get support from the Council and sponsors. You will need to expand your workshops and procure Automata designed by Leonardo himself &ndash; all this to increase your work efficiency. Hire apprentices straight out of the academy to nab highly coveted materials from the market before your rivals.&#10;&#10;Time is of the essence. Race to be the foremost in completing inventions. You will unlock rewards and special abilities if you are the first player to complete the inventions. Otherwise, you will get less rewards without special abilities.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds, the player who has amassed the largest fortune will be awarded victory!&#10;&#10;Who among you will be the most ingenious Renaissance inventor?&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=Changes from Leonardo da Vinci (2006):&#10;&#10;- The allocation of start game resources has changed. 4 resource selection cards are distributed,  of which 2 are kept, and their corresponding resources are collected. Receive additional resources according to to turn order.&#10;&#10;- Competitive elements have been strengthened for a 2 or 3 players game, allowing enjoyment of a similar tension at any player count.&#10;&#10;- More invention cards!  An increase from 25 to 40 cards,  with each card having special effects that players can use instantly, once in a round, and permanently.&#10;&#10;- More enticing Council options!  An increase from four to eight options, with florins piling up on tiles that no one has chosen each time a new tile is placed.&#10;&#10;- Card resources have been replaced with meeples, and player screens have been added.&#10;&#10;- Invention card completion has been modified so that everyone knows what inventions are being worked on at any given time.&#10;&#10;- Invention cards are now divided into current and future spaces, adding a new dimension for strategic play.&#10;&#10;- The 15-week inventions are now only revealed at the start of the game,  allowing players to prepare in advance.&#10;&#10;- Restrictions of the workshops have been lifted so that you can upgrade them, as well as add automata,  in the middle of working on an invention.&#10;&#10;- Each player now gets six objectives, all of which yield rewards upon fulfillment.  So if you find yourself falling behind in completing inventions, these objectives will help you catch up.&#10;&#10;- New effects have been added to the Laboratory and Academy. You can buy 1 work from the Laboratory and 1 resource from the Academy. Now there&rsquo;s a reason to use the Laboratory and Academy in the later of the game.&#10;&#10;- The game consists of 7 rounds. Players pay salaries to hired assistants at the end of rounds 3, 5, and 7. Some effects of the Laboratory and Academy change in rounds 4 and 6.  In round 7, players can sell resources instead of buying them.&#10;&#10;- The game comes with a double-sided game board; double-layered player boards; premium wooden, glass, and plastic resource tokens; and 12 transparent containers for storing components.&#10;&#10;",

Players will draft new wizards, heroes, and magical creatures into their ranks, building up an army to defeat and defend the different districts of Gateway.&#10;&#10;After successfully liberating a district, the player gains access to its unusual power, such as cheaper resources, additional defenses, or even the ability to magically damage foes from afar. Be warned: Not only will other rebel insurgents attempt to steal your districts away from you, but you'll also have to battle against the forces of Chancellor Gideon and an invading onslaught of terrible monsters called the Drueggar.&#10;&#10;To aid you in this are Runestones - powerful one-time-use spells that can turn the tide of battle instantly or provide the player with a temporary boost to his coffers. However, once used, Runestones become empty shells and are discarded for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;To win the game, players must collect victory points by defeating the city guard and Drueggar Horde, controlling important districts, or through special insurgent abilities they draft into their ranks. Don't delay and play the waiting game -- if the Drueggar manage to take all the city districts, it&rsquo;s game over for both the insurgents and the innocent citizens of Gateway!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "WAR OF THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE&#10;&#10;In this wargame for 2 players, ages 14 and up, recreate the war that pitted tiny Paraguay against the Brazilian Empire, Argentina, and Uruguay.&#10;&#10;When Brazil invaded Uruguay in 1864, no one could have foreseen that this act would spark the largest conflict in the history of South America. Paraguay entered the war in defense of Uruguay while Argentina allied with Brazil. Uruguay itself, once conquered, switched sides and declared war on Paraguay. Thus was born the Triple Alliance. Despite having a small population, little territory, and few resources, the Paraguayans fought with unexpected tenacity.&#10;&#10;First, they embarked on daring offensives, then they were forced to fight massive defensive battles, taking an unsustainable number of losses. After seven years of arduous fighting, the Paraguayan army participated in its last battle at Cerro Cor&aacute;, the only town left to be conquered by the Alliance. At the last stage of that desperate battle, Paraguayan President Solano L&oacute;pez committed suicide while cornered by Brazilian soldiers. Material and human losses were astronomical on both sides. It is said that more than 90% of the male population in Paraguay died during that colossal war. Even the victorious countries were brought to the brink of exhaustion &ndash; to such an extent that Brazil is, to this day, still in debt.&#10;&#10;Surprisingly, this war has never been represented in a game of its own. It is high time to bring this conflict to the forefront of the wargaming scene, not only so that fans of the genre can have the chance to recreate this conflict and explore different strategies, but also so that the general public can become more informed about such an important historical event in a simple way. For this reason, War of the Triple Alliance prides itself on two basic principles: historical depth and simple rules.&#10;&#10;The War of the Triple Alliance confronts the players with the dilemmas faced by the generals of the opposing sides. Paraguay starts with a strong army that can advance into Argentine and Brazilian territory, but does not have enough replacements to sustain a war of attrition. The allies (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay) must contain the Paraguayan onslaught and gain time by giving as little ground as possible, because as time goes by their armies will be more and more numerous, and they will be able to present battle.&#10;&#10;There is a moment when the strategy for both sides change completely: when the allied player accumulates enough troops to outnumber the Paraguayans, he begins a race to conquer Asunci&oacute;n and other important cities before the end of the game, while the Paraguayan player will try to slow down his advance or perhaps even stop it by relying on the fortifications that protect the ascent up the river.&#10;&#10;The game incorporates cards to make room for events that, while not strictly military, influenced the course of the war. Players must decide whether to gain immediate benefits in the form of new combat units, or whether to plan their strategy for the long term and prefer to put victory point cards into play or to modify the duration of the game. This increases the variability and excitement of the game, as well as enriching it by adding historical depth. Players have a more detailed explanation of card events in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game will be the one who economizes his forces better, uses his cards better and has been able to manage the timing of the game more wisely.&#10;&#10;The War of the Triple Alliance is a perfect game to enter the world of wargames. The rules are simple and intuitive, specifically designed to avoid tedious intermissions and the battles are resolved in a patterned way so that in each round the players are clear about their options. However, this apparent simplicity does not prevent players from having to make decisions on the edge, and experienced players will find the game very challenging: will the Paraguayan player launch himself southwards, trying to reach the strategic cities of Brazil or Argentina, or will he prefer to send his armies to Mato Grosso in the north, with the aim of completely eliminating a front and getting a good handful of cards that will shorten the game in his favor? Likewise, the Allied player has many decisions to make: Will he have enough temperance to avoid entering a decisive battle before accumulating enough troops? Will he advance along the most direct path to Asunci&oacute;n, storming the fearsome fortifications on the Paraguay River, or will he prefer to bypass them and begin a long campaign of conquest?&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;&bull;    1 double sided (English/ Spanish) 25.6&rdquo; x 19.6&rdquo; game board (mounted)&#10;&bull;    54 cards&#10;&bull;    2 starting cards&#10;&bull;    73 Paraguayan unit counters (including leaders)&#10;&bull;    89 Allied unit counters (including leaders)&#10;&bull;    4 Capital markers&#10;&bull;    3 fortress markers&#10;&bull;    4 victory point markers&#10;&bull;    54 control markers&#10;&bull;    3 red dice, 2 green dice, 2 blue dice&#10;&bull;    1 Battlefield Display&#10;&bull;    1 Rulebook English&#10;&bull;    1 Rulebook Spanish&#10;&bull;    1 Playbook English&#10;&bull;    1 Playbook Spanish&#10;&#10;MAIN CHARACTERISTICS&#10;&#10;&bull;    It only takes 2 hours to recreate this massive conflict.&#10;&bull;    Simple rules make the game&rsquo;s concepts easy to grasp for all types of players.&#10;&bull;    The game&rsquo;s card selection system forces each player to make interesting choices.&#10;&bull;    Quick and intense games with special attention paid to the details of the map and illustrations of the armies.&#10;&bull;    Historical accuracy.

You do so by illuminating manuscripts with elaborate religious artwork. But not all is as peaceful as it once was! Possessed with eccentric enthusiasm, one of you has turned from the reverent to the irreverent by scrawling demons instead of angels and by painting fierce dragons instead of noble knights. Who will become the new master of the Scriptorium? Will it be the monk who reverently illuminates the page with monks, dogs, knights and angels; or the irreverent monk who whimsically draws the forces of rabbit, squirrel, dragon and demon? Play Illumination to find out!&#10;&#10;OBJECT&#10;&#10;Each turn, players create illuminations in three Books by placing one full row or column of tiles of their choice from their Player mat. With careful placement, players collect Coins that  allow  them  to perform special actions or  purchase Scriptorium cards. By placing tiles next to others of matching color, players collect Ritual tokens to score points at the Ritual stations in the Monastery when they are occupied by the Abbot.&#10;&#10;As tiles are placed in Books, conflicts are set in motion:  Angels wrestle with Demons, Knights skirmish with Dragons,  Monks contend with Rabbits, and Dogs struggle with Squirrels. These conflicts are resolved only when they are bounded on all sides. Then, the player with more tiles on their side wins the &#10;Bounded Battle, flips the losing side&rsquo;s tiles facedown, and places their Marker on the matching Battle card.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players score points for the Rituals  recorded on the Monastery mat and 1 point for each of their faceup Illumination tiles in each Book. Players also score points for placing more Markers on Battle cards and for defeated factions that match their Crusade card. The player with more points wins!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

His final wish was that his descendants would share his fortune and the plots of his ranch, with the richest becoming the new head of the family. After all, for him the most important thing was that his money stayed in the family! Pappy thought of everything and left an outline of his belongings. In Pappy Winchester, you and the other heirs are now assembled around this map to divvy up Pappy's possessions...&#10;&#10;The game board features 19 plots of land, divided into seven desert plots, six prairie plots, and six forest plots, with train tracks and a river running crossways through the land, and a saloon set apart from everything else. To set up play, give each player $8,000 and two secret objective cards, then place a bonus token face down on each plot of land.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player draws a plot token at random, then players hold an auction for that plot, with the winner marking it with one of their tokens, then revealing the bonus token and carrying out its effects. This token might let you look at the face-down mine or ranch cards to determine the value of those plots; move the train or boat along the tracks or river, with players owning properties adjacent to this vehicle's location earning money; or collect funds from the saloon. The winner of the auction then divides their bid as equally as possible among all other players, with any remainder being placed on the saloon.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a duel token, and when a player is involved in an auction that's down to them and someone else, they can decide to sped that token. If they do, a third player shuffles two duel cards &mdash; one showing a gun being fired, and the other not &mdash; then each bidder takes one of them, with the player holding the firing gun winning the auction.&#10;&#10;Five piles of banknotes are laid out at the start of play, with a different shared objective card placed on each pile. If the completion of an auction allows a player to meet one or more of the objectives, such as owning one of each type of land or having three plots that don't touch the river, then that player claims the banknotes under that card. After the 19th auction, players reveal their secret objectives, earning money for how well they've met those goals, and whoever owns the most plots of land receives $5,000. Whoever now holds the most money wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The conversation returned to the weather; It had poured rain throughout the night and Drouot, the commander of the Emperor's artillery was worried about the effect on his guns. Napoleon acquiesced to a delay in starting the attack. This was the first of many fateful decisions to be made on that day...&#10;&#10;Waterloo 200 is a new concept game covering the epic Waterloo Battle fought in Belgium in June 1815.&#10;&#10;Developed on wooden blocks, over a colorful 86x64 cm mapboard, 400g thick.&#10;The over 200 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;Historical Background&#10;On June 18 1815, Napoleon's Arm&eacute;e du Nord and a coalition led by Wellington, clashed over the plains of Waterloo in Belgium for a decisive battle.&#10;&#10;Waterloo is a game for two or three players, one controls the French Army and the other one/two control the Seventh Coalition.&#10;Although based on history, players in command of the two sides can modify the evolution of the battle and of the history in the Europe of XIX centuries.&#10;&#10;Rules Introduction&#10;The rules are easy - 6 pages - players can start playing the game without too many rules to remember and the game is 5 turn long (90-120 minutes)&#10;Then the 10 Optional Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as special Cavalry abilities (Charge, Scouting, Impetus), Artillery Bombardment, Retreat, Combined Attack, Morale...&#10;&#10;Scale&#10;A cm is approximately 70 meters.&#10;A turn is 2 'hours' long.&#10;A full strength counter represents a Leader or a Brigade (30-50 guns, 1000 Cavalrymen, or 3,000 infantrymen) depending on the unit's type, training, morale and leadership.&#10;&#10;Fog of War&#10;The game must be played with the Fog of War on (wooden blocks are placed on the map in such a way the opponent player can not see them).&#10;&#10;Language: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian&#10;Genre: Tactic&#10;Turns: Turn-Based&#10;Complexity: Entry Level to Basic, depending on which rules are used&#10;Period: Napoleonic&#10;&#10;Microbadge: &#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Main aim&#10;A strategy game where you need to skillfully place construction blocks to build three historic sites from the Nouvelle France era, outwit your opponents, and thereby gain points. Add to that three further ways of either bettering your score or hindering your opponents.&#10;&#10;Concept and Goal of the Game&#10;Each turn, carefully place a construction block to help build either the military redoubt, the church, or the seigneurial mill. At the end of each turn, players gain points based on the placement of these blocks. Three times during the game, it will snow and this is when players receive extra points based on the number of cubes of their colour present in the level being tallied up. The snowdrifts are then added to each building, fitting around and hiding the level that has just been tallied, therefore limiting the remaining space available to gain points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game&#10;Each turn, a player draws a card illustrating a type of construction block, taking the one indicated from the stock pile. They need to add the block to one of the buildings in line with the rules of play: a wall must not be more than 3 cubes high; blocks must be within limits shown on the foundation tiles; blocks must not be inserted underneath another one already in play etc. Once the block has been placed, one point is awarded for each newly added cube of the player&rsquo;s colour, with further points being added for all the cubes already in play of the same color that this new block touches. Therefore, players should try to have as many of the cubes already in play of their colour touching those of corresponding colour in the newly placed block to maximize their score per turn. Also, strategically played ally cards and colourless blocks allow players to increase their scores.&#10;When a snowflake card is drawn from the construction-block deck, the game stops, and points are awarded to each player based on the number of cubes of their colour found in the level being tallied. The snowdrifts are then added. This happens three times during the game. When the first snowflake card is drawn, points are tallied for the first level of each of the three construction sites. When the second snowflake card is drawn, points are tallied for the second level. Finally, when the third snowflake is drawn the tally is done for the third and final level, and the game ends. The tally sticks placed next to each building indicate how points are attributed each level. On the tally sticks there are +, - and x 2 symbols indicating how many points players win or lose based on the number of cubes of their colour in the level being tallied.&#10;&#10;End of the Game &#10;The game ends when the third snow flake is turned over. Points are tallied for a final time for the third floor of each construction site. The player having the most points on the points&rsquo; board is declared the winner and earns the title of Royal Engineer for New France.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Go-Moku&quot; (Japanese - also spelled &quot;Gomoku&quot;) or &quot;wuziqi&quot; (Chinese) is a very old game played with a Go set. The game can also be played on a sheet of graph paper using X's and O's. It is similar in idea to tic-tac-toe, but far greater in scale and complexity.  The name means &quot;five points.&quot;&#10;&#10;It is debated whether this game originated in China or Japan, with more evidence pointing to the former.&#10;&#10;The object is to get five stones in a row.  The game is played on a 19x19 board (such as the board used in Go), creating a large and open field to complete this objective. The game can also be played on a smaller board, such as the popular 15x15 option.&#10;&#10;If played perfectly, Black (who goes first) can always win the game. Even before this was proven, the game was recognized to be easier for Black.  This problem is solved in Renju. which is often seen as the adult contemporary to the kids' Go-Moku.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the summer of 1842 and the finest mathematicians from around the world have gathered at The Archimedes&rsquo; Museum of Mathematics for a grand soiree! Amidst all the merriment, a terrible crime occurs &mdash; the robbery of the priceless Lebombo Bone artefact.&#10;&#10;Evidence of the theft has been scattered across the museum grounds. Only Ada Lovelace &mdash; pioneer of the Analytical Machine and part-time sleuth &mdash; is up to the challenge of solving the crime. Time is of the essence and she must work quickly to examine each room of the museum and assess each piece of evidence. She has only minutes before the trail goes cold.&#10;&#10;In Ada Lovelace: Consulting Mathematician, players assemble polyomino pieces on a map of the Archimedes&rsquo; Museum of Mathematics, aiming to capture key pieces of criminal evidence. Doing so may grant the player extra abilities they can use in future turns, allowing them to more efficiently search the map. After five rounds, the player scores points based on how many pieces of evidence were captured, how many rooms were searched, and how many abilities were unlocked.&#10;&#10;Ada Lovelace: Consulting Mathematician is a solo roll-and-write game. It was a finalist in the GenCan't Roll and Write Contest, 2017.&#10;&#10;",

Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Marvel 100 4-Pack is a standalone game that includes the characters Captain America, Iron Man, Black Panther, and Black Widow. This set may be combined with others, giving you the ability to assemble the team you want!&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of four suits, two have one through twelve cards, two have one through fifteen cards.  The suits are ranked high to low, with the fifteen suits in the middle.  Each turn, players have to play a card onto the last card played.  In order for the play to be legal, the card played must be 'higher' in either suit or numeric value.  If you play a card that beats the last card in both categories (suit and value), then you must play another card with the same restrictions.  If you cannot play a card, then you take penalty.  The first person to play his entire hand ends the hand, and everyone scores the value of the remaining cards in his hand.  During subsequent hands, the player with the highest score (the current loser) can decide to reverse the suit order (mirror it) to make his hand better.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!&#10;&#10;Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;In Adventure Games: Im Nebelreich, you represent heroes who have returned from a short trip on behalf of an old seer to find their village deserted. Where did everyone go? Over three chapters, each of which takes about two hours to play, you will meet mysterious people, discover new places, and experience an exciting adventure. During your investigations, you also learn more about the individual heroes of this co-operative parlor game. How will the fantastic story end? That's up to you!&#10;&#10;",

The game is published in a Japanese / English edition.&#10;&#10;In the game, the player starts with one hand card, then draws a second. From these two, they play a card to the tableau. Cards are played touching, in columns left or right but shifted halfway up or down. In the one-player game, a column is restricted to 4 cards, in the two player, the limit is 3 cards. Alternately, you may exchange a played card with a hand card. But next turn, after drawing, you must play down two cards so your hand is back down to one before drawing.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards are played, cards are turned face-down if any card on its right is of a lower number. Then the player tries to find paths in the tableau from the far left to the far right side. Think of this as telling the story. Any cards that are not part of a valid path are also turned down.&#10;&#10;Now you score for colour groups, and deduct points for face-down cards and gaps in the tableau. After keeping a column, shuffle the deck over and play a second round to get your final score and the King's opinion!&#10;&#10;For two players, it's the same--with both players working a hand of two cards each. You cannot consult about which card to play, but after choosing, you may confer about placing. The final score this time reflects a test of your friendship.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&quot;You shall be rewarded if your tale amuses me.&quot;&#10;&#10;The eccentric king issued the edict to all over the country. You are a bard who is willing to take up that challenge. You have to make up a tale by mixing stories in the world and enchant the king with the tale.&#10;&#10;With 22 beautifully illustrated tarot cards with four background colours, this card game demands you make a succession of tough decisions. You will be excited to see how the storyline barely keeps consistency.&#10;&#10;Basically, you play a card from two cards in your hand each turn. When you have played all cards, the first round ends and you score according to the card positions. With some of these cards remaining in play, the game proceeds to the second round in the same way. The total of two rounds is your final score.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:

    "Description": "1873 Harzbahn is an 18xx variant set in the Harz mountain range in northern Germany. It simulates not only the (narrow-gauge) railroads in that area, but also mines and other plants. Mining in the Harz mountains suffered a major crisis in the end of the 19th century and the theme of the game is to end this crisis by connecting the mines and other plants to the railroad network - and of course by proper management of the 7 public railroad companies, 15 private mining companies, and up to 5 public mining companies.&#10;&#10;1873 has a bunch of fundamental differences from the usual 18xx game, which makes it one of the more distant members of the family (most prominent are the totally different systems of train operations, route determination, and revenue calculation).&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The game presents an interesting dynamic. Mines are static and need rails to move product.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 15 independent mines struggling with horse drawn delivery. Rails are just beginning to extend track through the difficult terrain with weak and puny engines hardly better than horse drawn wagons.  What do you invest in? The rails or the mines?&#10;&#10;Soon however some mines are connected and the profits begin to roll in. But not very efficiently for the mines as they are too fragmented and cannot get good prices for their product. The mines then join forces into mining companies. The mining companies pay better then the independent companies but have limited capital. Do you continue to reap Okay revenues or take it public. Public mining companies move quickly to acquire additional mines from their owners who reap huge profits.&#10;&#10;New rail companies are also forming but have to struggle with purchasing routes and difficult terrain. But the mines need the track so once connected to the mines, they start turning a profit. But how do they protect their market or extend and try to expand to new markets?&#10;&#10;Some may fail, overextended by mismanagement and greedy owners. Others with prudent management and extended routes can reap huge profits for the shareholders.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1244 - The Mongol Empire rules from Eastern Europe clear across Asia to the Pacific Ocean. It was (and still is) the largest contiguous empire in the history of the world. The Great Khan rules from the capital Karakorum over the empire and he sends out his best generals to conquer more areas for the ruler of all Mongols. Mongol strategy gives individual generals a high degree of independence in deciding how to invade and conquer new territories, so long as they keep to the overall objectives. The Mongol armies are highly mobile and enemies are terrorized by their ability to appear everywhere at once. To prevent enemy rulers from being able to regain control of their armies, the Mongols drive the rulers out and pursue them relentlessly wherever they flee.&#10;&#10;In KHAN it's your task to chase out the 8 different rulers of the lands that you are invading and to conquer as many valuable areas as you can. The general that fulfills this task the best will be proclaimed the next Great Khan.&#10;&#10;Each player invades areas by placing his yurts on the board. A player can then conquer two or more adjacent areas by laying one of the variously shaped conquer tiles over the yurts (not all the yurts need to be the player's own). Conquer tiles will bring the player victory points - the larger the conquer tile, the greater the number of victory points. At the end of the game the players with the largest connected conquered territories will gain additional victory points. The player who then has the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
