    "Description": "Flick Wars is a strategy and tactics dexterity game with six factions that range from humans to mechs to alien races. Each faction has a unique set of units.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to eliminate all of the enemy units. The advanced game has specific scenarios and a new game play option which focuses on objective control. Units are discs with a picture representing the type of unit on it. Moving and attacking are both flicks. To move, you just flick your disc; to attack, you need to be in range. When you make a successful attack flick, the target unit flips over and is another obstacle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sword and the Stars sets the stage for interstellar conflict between vying empires on such a scale (the map depicts about 1/4 of a spiral galaxy) that individual ships and even fleets become insignificant. You pay for and resolve entire interstellar campaigns with cards representing massive scale investment of manpower and resources over 4 Earth years of operations, each player round representing the passage of 20 years. Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.&#10;&#10;The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints. This means that in an interstellar war, nowhere is safe from your enemies.&#10;&#10;Includes a mechanism for a sort of Galactic Security Council, where players can scheme all sorts of mischief against each other.&#10;&#10;Ten scenarios (including the &quot;Galactic Cycle&quot; campaign game) are supplied. A &quot;short&quot; game will depict a period lasting about 200 years, while for the long &quot;grand campaign&quot; scenario it is recommended to play &quot;at least&quot; 1000 years. The Sword and the Stars is more compact than Empires. Includes 400 counters, 56 year cards, a 17 x 22&quot; map depicting a total of 42 star systems. Maximum 5 players (3-4 recommended).&#10;&#10;Historical Note:&#10;Writing about SPI's Empires of the Middle Ages (q.v.), editor Kula included a sidebar quote from Redmond Simonsen to the effect that &quot;a good number of people...would really enjoy the game if they'd just imagine that it's a science fictional or fantastic continent instead of Europe&quot;. Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn has three steps:&#10;&#10;     At the start of each turn, the Host rolls a pair of dice and determine a Banquet Goal.&#10;     The Host makes 3 &quot;scavenge&quot; rolls and rats collect supplies.&#10;     The Rats compare supplies with the Host to see who gets to take special actions. There are five different types of supply, and five different things you can do.&#10;&#10;&#10;Goals are scored at the END of the game. The game ends after five turns. The last turn begins when you circle the 5th goal. After this final turn, the rats throw the banquet. The Host who was decided at the end of the final turn leads the rats through the Awards Ceremony, checking each circled Banquet Goal from lowest to highest number to see who won awards for each goal.&#10;&#10;The rat with the MOST awards is deemed the most fabulous aboard and wins the ship&rsquo;s only life raft. (If there is a tie, the final Host selects which rat with the most awards deserves the life raft.) Everyone applauds the winner. Finally, the rat with the FEWEST awards flips a coin. If the coin lands on heads? Congratulations! All the rats escape into the ice-cold water, moments before the ship sinks. But if the coin lands on tails? Do send our regards to the captain.&#10;&#10;",

Each time the vacuum cleaner comes out you strive to be recognised as the most daring of all Dustbunnies by risking the dangers of the vortex.&#10;&#10;Each round your fate is secretly linked with one of six fluffballs. The closer you can get your fluffball to the vacuum without it being sucked-up the more daring you will seem when the fates are revealed after the contest.&#10; Use your innate control of static, charms you found down the back of the sofa and your unique character powers to collectively propel the balls of fluff across the carpet. The furniture, rugs and even pets you encounter will help and hinder your efforts.&#10; Keep which colour of fluffball fate has handed you a secret, while working out which one your opponents are linked to and then decide which to send up the tube. Choose correctly and your opponent will be the agonised loser while you will rise to fame and glory in the kingdom behind the skirting boards.&#10;&#10;Daring Dustbunnies is a game for 2 to 5 players. Each game lasts approximately 15 minutes per player and is suitable for ages 10 and up.&#10;&#10;This is a card driven race game with a difference. The aim of the game is to attempt to move the fluffball you are secretly supporting to the highest scoring position (closest to the vacuum) when each round ends without being sucked-up.&#10; You start the game with 4 randomly dealt cards, each showing one of the six fluffballs and a &quot;suction&quot; number for how far it moves. On your turn you play one card to move a fluffball towards the doom that is the vacuum cleaner. Each carpet tile has a special power and if you move a fluffball onto an empty tile you immediately perform the carpet action. Moving onto an occupied space will reward you with static, the currency in the game which powers the charms. Exhausting your hand of cards will earn you an extra charm and four new cards.&#10;&#10;Keeping which ball of fluff you are linked to a secret is key if you want it to stay out of the vacuum. &#10;Being closest to the vacuum of doom will earn you a gold medal but being inside it loses you everything.&#10;Use timing, tactics and trickery to prove you are the smartest and bravest of all the Daring Dustbunnies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tute is an Italian trick-taking card game for two to four players. During the 19th century, the game spread in Spain, becoming one of the most popular card games in the country. The name of the game was later modified by Spanish speakers, who started calling the game Tute. The game is played with a deck of traditional Spanish playing cards, or naipes, that is very similar to the Italian 40-card deck.&#10;&#10;The classic version of the game is Two-player Tute, while the most played is Tute in Pairs, where four players form two teams. The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza (a pile next to a player that contains the cards that the player gets after winning a trick) and by declarations (holding certain combinations of cards). Due to its wide popularity, several variations of the game exist.&#10;&#10;The game is played with a Spanish deck of cards, which is divided into four suits: Oros (coins), Espadas (spades), Copas (cups) and Bastos (clubs). The 8s and 9s of each suit are excluded, leaving forty cards in the deck. The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza and from declarations.&#10;&#10;Tute in Pairs is played by four players&mdash;two teams of two players each&mdash;and every player receives ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means that all of the cards in the deck are dealt). The last card to be dealt is shown to the rest of the players and becomes the trump. This card belongs to the player it was dealt to. The four people sit in a circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.&#10;&#10;One person plays a card, and the player to the right of this person, from the opponent team, plays a card. As with Two-player Tute, if the second player has one or more higher cards of the same suit as the first player's card, one of these must be played. If the second player has cards of the same suit, but only ones of less value than the first card, one of these must be played. If the second player does not have any cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards, one of these must be played. If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps, any other card can be played.&#10;&#10;Now, the next player to the right plays a card following the same rules as the second player: if possible, a card of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or if this is not possible, then lower; if no card of the same suit is held, then if possible, a trump card must be played; if no trump card is held, then any card may be played. The fourth player likewise plays a card following these same rules.&#10;&#10;When all four cards of the trick are on the table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards of the other two suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the declarations are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt at the start of the next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands&#10;&#10;Tute games are played until an established number of game points is reached. Each time one of the competitors wins a round, one point is added to the total score of the player or pair. New rounds are played until a player or pair reaches the game points goal (three and six point games are the most common). When the number is reached the player or pair wins.&#10;&#10;The winner (or the pair of winners) of the round is determined by the total of round points each player (or pair) collects. These points are calculated as the sum of card values in baza, bonus points for declarations and the final trick bonus.&#10;&#10;A player (or a pair), who wins at least one trick receives an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed until the end of round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck.&#10;&#10;The player, who collected all the four Kings, is entitled to declare tute (all), which automatically ends the round with a collector's victory. Having both King and Knight of the trump suit, one can declare las cuarenta (forty), scoring additional 40 round points. The combination of King and Knight of any other suit can be declared as veinte (twenty); it adds 20 round points to the player's score. If possible, a player can declare several combination. In such cases the declarations with the higher round point value must be made first. For example, after declaring veinte the player loses right to declare las cuarenta, though declaring another veinte is still allowed. In Two-player games the declaration order rule only applies to declarations between each trick is played, so the player can declare las cuarenta after veinte if the combination is collected by picking the previously missing card from the stock.&#10;&#10;The total of the round points the player (or pair) has gained is calculated as the sum of values of the cards collected in the baza and the values of the declared combinations. The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points. The total value of the deck (and thus the maximum amount of round points) is 230 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game basically re-enacts the tale of the three little pigs.  Players cooperate in building the brick house and avoiding the wolf until they are all safe inside the brick house.&#10;&#10;Play is basic roll-and-move, with each pig having a die of its own color.  Die results are either move 1, 2, or 3 spaces (in either direction), or move the wolf, or run away to one of the three houses.&#10;&#10;The wolf moves clockwise in jumps that can sweep up any piggies he lands on or passes.  Pigs that are caught are put in the cook pot.  The other little pigs can rescue pigs in the pot if they land on one of the cauldron spaces and roll a die successfully.&#10;&#10;Pigs are safe when they are in a house.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the brick house is not yet built.  It has four pieces.  When a pig lands on the brick house space, he or she can add one piece to the house.  Once the brick house is completed, the pigs can occupy it.  Once all three pigs are in the brick house, they win.  If the wolf captures all three pigs, however, they lose.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bloody 110 - The Battle for Clervaux, December 16-17, 1944 is the first game in the Tactical Combat Series (TCS) by The Gamers and it features the vital two day delay of the 2nd Panzer Division by elements of the US 28th Infantry Division along the road to Bastogne on December 16th and 17th, 1944. The actions of the handful of Americans represented by the game were critical in setting the stage for the more famous siege of Bastogne itself. It was their defense that provided the time needed for other units, including the 101st Airborne, to make it to Bastogne in order to defend it. Without this successful defense, Bastogne would surely have fallen and the road would have been clear to the Meuse.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters&#10;Units: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full color maps&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page TCS specific rulebook&#10;One 14-page Bloody 110 specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-30 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Get Off My Land! is a game of rival farmers competing for limited space and resources. The game takes place over the course a year as you start your farm from nothing, and build it up to generate more money. The player that has managed to amass the most money by the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;Build Your Farm&#10;&#10;Each farmhouse starts the game surrounded by forest. The first step is to clear the forest; this not only provides land to build farms on, but also wood to build fences with. By fencing off the cleared land, you create areas to grow crops or raise animals.&#10;&#10;Plant Crops and Raise Animals&#10;&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve got cleared and fenced land, it&rsquo;s time to go to the market to buy crops and animals for your farm. There&rsquo;s limited stock available though, so buy what you need quickly before other farmers do.&#10;&#10;Gain Income&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;re not growing crops for fun, you need to get paid! Some things on your farm will provide you with a slow and steady trickle of income, and others can be harvested to gain a larger amount of money right away. Of course if you harvest something, you&rsquo;ll need to wait for it to grow again.&#10;&#10;Expand Your Farm&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s limited land and resources available, so why not re-adjust the fence line a little bit so that your neighbor&rsquo;s cows are now on your side? Other farmers are trying to steal your precious potatoes too, so don&rsquo;t let down your guard.&#10;&#10;",

Everyone plays one card, and the lowest of these will go first.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may either play a new card face up or call one of your opponents. When you play a card, you are trying not to play the last card of that rank. For example, if you play a 5, you are declaring that someone's hand still contains a 5. If you have one, you know you're safe. If not, you're making an educated guess.&#10;&#10;A call ends the hand. When you call another player, you are saying that they were wrong when they played their last card, and there are no more cards of that rank left in anyone's hand. If the caller is right, she wins the pot, plus a penalty equal to the rank of the card, paid by the called player. (For example, 7 coins for calling a 7.) If the caller is wrong, the called player wins the pot, and he wins the same penalty from the caller.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to get ahead in Deadfall: You can catch people when they play the wrong cards, and you can trick others into calling you when you're safe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Forgotten Legions: Designer Signature Edition marks the return of not just one, but TWO wargaming classics by Vance von Borries.&#10;&#10;Drive on Damascus and Bloody Keren, both now published together for the first time in the same package and with the same basic rules set. They have been re-mastered and updated into all-new, super-sized editions. These were well regarded by many as balanced and thoughtful games. They cover fascinating, almost forgotten conflicts that would guide the course of World War II in the Mediterranean Theater and East Africa.&#10;&#10;Forgotten Legions is yet another Classic Reborn! by Compass Games.&#10;&#10;Drive on Damascus gives you an Operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the (June and July) 1941 Allied invasion of Vichy French held Syria and Lebanon. Here you can hone your game play skills with open maneuvering on the desert side of the map and tough in-fighting on the mountain side. A fluid situation can develop as both sides seek the opportunity to outflank and attack. And along the coast players will probe for vulnerabilities by maneuver and infiltration. An exhaustive Order of Battle based on archival records helps capture key historical facets of the campaign including armor advantage, air power, ranged artillery, flotillas and commandos, garrisons, mountain units, untried units, and more. Also examined is the possibility of a German intervention&#10;&#10;Bloody Keren presents an Operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the (January through April) 1941 campaign in Italian Eritrea that historically saw a climax at the mountain pass at Keren. Here too, good game play is at a premium as strategically you allocate your forces to various mountain passes. Both sides can attack and counter-attack while guerilla forces attempt to close off reinforcements coming from the south.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature Edition provides a fully updated treatment to the 1981 and 1983 releases by World Wide Wargames (3W) that honor the original game designs. All aspects of the games have been enhanced &ndash; rules, charts and tables, map, counters &ndash; based on years of player experience and feedback. The rules are common to both games and are short and well illustrated, along with extensive Design Notes. Each game has a short scenario in addition to the Campaign scenario. While suitable for solitaire play and designed as a two-player game, each Campaign scenario can allow for up to four players (two per side). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in paying homage and celebrating the original classic designs by Vance von Borries. For your gaming enjoyment, this game has been super-sized by featuring a larger playing surface (two maps) and the larger 5/8&rdquo; counters to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This two-player card game recreates the drama of the day Allied soldiers went ashore in occupied France, 6 June 1944. Each of the historic landing beaches - Gold, Juno, Sword, Omaha and Utah - is represented by its own card, as are the defending German divisions and attacking Allied units. The Allied player must marshal his resources to gain and secure control of every beach by day's end: one run-through of the 110-card deck.&#10;&#10;The tension in the game increases with each card thrown, like the build up in a close baseball game. At first it seems the Allies have resources to meet every crisis across the beachheads, but if a key airborne division gets scattered across the countryside, allowing a counterattacking panzer division to slip through the perimeter, everything can change instantly. And an Allied unit committed to one beach, where you might find the defense isn't as strong as you thought, can't be called back in time to rush to the true danger zone. Both players must constantly be thinking ahead, looking for ways to best utilize their cards several throws down the line.&#10;&#10;Lightning Game Series&#10;&#10;",

It's set in the retro-inspired pixel art world of Brotherwise Games' best-selling Boss Monster, with many of the same familiar characters.&#10;&#10;Build your map by drafting Icy Peaks, Towns, Sunken Cities, Spawning Grounds, Roads, and Dungeon Entrances. Each terrain type has a different point value and unique ability. Some abilities even allow you to move tiles across the overworld, stealing from your opponents or giving them your unwanted tiles. Players must balance optimal placement, set values, and board space. You'll also need to manage monsters, which award points when grouped together or placed on matching terrain.&#10;&#10;The game includes everything needed for a 2 player game: over 65 terrain tiles, over 80* monster and hero tokens, 1 double-sided 2-player board, a scorepad, and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "from Schloesser session report:&#10;&#10;This is a  trick-taking game, but with enough twists to give it a very different feel. Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:&#10;&#10;a) trump colors (primary &amp; secondary) &#10;b) most or fewest tricks &#10;c) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'&#10;&#10;Bidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.&#10;&#10;After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase. A number of rounds equal to the number of players is played, with the player accumulating the greatest number of victory points being the victor.&#10;&#10;",

The game has variable victory conditions reflecting the historical ebb and flow. Main units are fronts, armies and corps; also units for static Garrisons and Soviet factories (need to move Eastward by rail before capture); markers for fortification, artillery, overrun/blitz and dispersal are all provided. Weather, terrain, supply and ZoC rules are used. Victory is measured by control of key cities at key moments.&#10;&#10;The rules provide for several &quot;scenarios&quot; (different start and end dates) for shorter playing times and there is also a simplified version using less units and stripped down rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;First published as a Game Kit by the designer with color copied counters on blue &amp; red paper and a B&amp;W map that you could color in.&#10;The Wargamer Magazine Vol.I, #19 is the 2nd edition of the game&#10;&#10;",

Scenarios taking place later postulate an alliance of the USA, a United Europe, Iran, China, and other countries joining for the conquest of the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;Contains: 24 page rulebook; 1,200 colorful die cut cardboard playing pieces; four 22&quot; x 34&quot; hexagonal grid soft map sections; and various playing aids.  This game came in a flat plastic pack or a 'detergent soap' sized box.  An excellent solitaire as well as 3-player game.&#10;&#10;",

Players use their firefighters to cover as much area as possible, while also staying connected to a water source.&#10;&#10;Volcano! - re-implements Vulkan!, which is played with the components of Feurio!. Ablaze! also includes new airplane and volcano tiles. Players control air tankers to drop water in order to extinguish or isolate sections of a fire created by a volcano. Save the most land, and you&rsquo;ll be the hero.&#10;&#10;On the Run! - is played with the same components as the other two games, but with different rules.

They herald adventures, magic, enchanted creatures, and mysterious transformations. They conjure far-off lands, brave hunters, determined princesses, fearsome giants, and talking animals. Above all, they begin our favorite fairy tales.&#10;&#10;Fairy Tales, the debut game of the StoryLine series, invites you to craft your own original fairy tales beginning with that remarkable phrase &quot;Once upon a time&quot;. In this fanciful card game, three to eight players craft a story together with each player contributing characters, places, objects, and events to the narrative.&#10;&#10;StoryLine: Fairy Tales is a collaborative storytelling game that encourages players to play cards to add to the story and embellish on them. Each round a player is the narrator and ask the other players for a specific type of card such as an object or location to add to the story. All other players select one of these cards from their hand, then the narrator chooses the one they like most and awards that player a point. At the end of the story, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players each start with three cards in hand, and the overall goal of the game is to collect 3-6 goal cards, with the exact number possibly changing during play.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws one card, plays one card, then moves one space, with all of those values being subject to change during gameplay; depending on what's currently allowed by the rules, you can also use movement points to rotate or move tiles in the play area. If you have a piece on each icon shown on the topmost goal card in play, you claim that card and are that much closer to winning. Players can also claim goal cards they have in hand by, again, placing their pieces on the appropriate icons. Other cards in the game allow players to change the rules, the game board, the ownership of player pieces, and so on.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The king encourages all barons to expand their domains as new land is conquered. To gain favor in his eyes, each baron must show his worth by constructing buildings and thus increase the splendor of the kingdom, or by supporting the king in the war with military units. With the king's eyes fixed on the frontlines, he probably wouldn't notice your sharp elbow in your neighbour's side... right?&#10;&#10;Brawling Barons is a tactical card game consisting of 54 cards. From this deck of cards each player draws cards and collects resources. Units (peasants and squires) can then be played from the hand. The peasants can be upgraded (rotated) to buildings, and squires can become various military units. The military units can be sent to the frontlines to gain victory points (VPs), or they can attack opposing towns. When the last card is removed from the deck, the game ends and VPs are counted.&#10;&#10;Tactical options include choosing units to play, waiting for the perfect timing to play them, optimizing the actions, and playing the right events. At first glance, it may seem too simple, but new depths can certainly be discovered.&#10;&#10;Brawling Barons can be played in 10-20 minutes by two experienced players. Three-player games take about 30 minutes. By combining two decks, up to six players can play, either in a deathmatch or in team play.&#10;&#10;",

In Twisty Tracks, players are rewarded for both long journeys and arrival at point B &mdash; assuming not too many others arrived there first.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own playing area that consists of a cardboard frame that depicts stations, loops of train track, and four train depots. Place a wooden train on each depot, and shuffle face down your personal stack of fifteen track tiles. On a turn, each player draws a tile, then places it somewhere in their frame so that they can advance at least one of their trains along the track. When you advance a train, you score 1 point each time it crosses the border between two tiles or between a tile and the frame. Try to send trains on long loopy journeys to score lots of points!&#10;&#10;If a train reaches one of the seven stations on the frame, you receive the highest value for this station that hasn't yet been claimed. Wait too long, and you risk scoring nothing. If two of your trains collide while moving on freshly laid tracks, you score points for the borders they've crossed, then remove them from play. When all four of your trains have reached stations or been removed, stop placing tiles.&#10;&#10;Once all players' trains have stopped moving, the game ends, and whoever has scored the most points wins. In a tie, the tied player who placed more tiles wins. For an easier game, you can play with only the station scoring or only the border scoring.&#10;&#10;",

Be careful who you invite as sometimes the characters will disappear as soon as they arrive!&#10;&#10;In Tea Time, players collect characters from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, and each character card (other than Alice) is double-sided, with a normal image on one side and a reverse &quot;mirrored&quot; image on the other. Each round, an array of characters is laid out, with normal and mirrored images alternating. The round's start player takes one character, adds it to his collection, then places the Alice card in that spot of the array. The next player takes 1-2 cards, but if he takes two, the cards must be adjacent. From the third player on, each player takes 1-3 cards; again, you can take multiple cards only if they're adjacent. If you ever have a normal and a mirrored image of the same character in your collection, *poof* they both disappear.&#10;&#10;After five rounds (with two players) or three rounds (with 3-4 players), the game ends. Players score 1-15 points for collecting 1-5 cards of the same character &ndash; with zero cards of a character being worth five points, so sometimes you do want them to vanish! Alice herself is worth four points, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game has over 1000 combinations in the initial release.&#10;&#10;The basic win condition is to gather 100 Spark, but the game also includes Goal cards that can alter the rules and win condition for additional replay value.

At the end of a long line of communication back to Paris, the Grande Arm&eacute;e feigns weakness in the cold and fog of an early December morning in 1805. Now Austerlitz 20 presents the story of desperation and destiny as three Emperors clash to resolve the fate of Europe. With its myriad scenarios and variations, students of history can explore a plethora of &quot;What if?&quot; possibilities as Allied greatness clashes with French glory at the dawn of the &quot;Sun of Austerlitz.&quot;&#10;&#10;This game features only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. It is the addition of &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &quot;friction of war&quot; that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 corps or division, each hex is about 800 meters, and each turn is roughly 3 daylight hours (or 10 night hours).&#10;&#10;2009 Charles S.

    "Description": "Vorpals is a card drafting game. It is played in four rounds, with each round representing 25 years of game time. They players are princes seeking power over an island.  Over a period of 100 years, each prince will organize their army, expand their territories and fight neighbouring lords.&#10;&#10;The goal is to accumulate more victory points than anyone else by earning the devotion of the people. There are three main ways to do this. The first is to win wars with neighbouring lords. Second, it is possible to construct buildings to produce wood and ore. The third is to use the special powers of each unit or building. You are free to choose which of these strategies to pursue, individually or in combination.&#10;&#10;Each round is composed of the following four phases:&#10;1.    Deployment phase: acquire a unit card by drafting and place it by paying the cost.  Units come in three basic varieties; military (e.g. veterans, knights), development (e.g. workers and farmers), and allies (e.g. dragons, goblins) &#10;2.    War Phase: Players make war with neighbouring players, the winner gaining victory points.&#10;3.    Production phase: the production of income and resources, which enable buildings (e.g. treasury, barracks, castle) to be constructed.  Every building starts at level 1 and can be improved to level 2 by spending more resources.&#10;4.    Aging phase: people and monsters die two rounds after they are deployed. So, you can feel the generations change and you must carefully plan how to maintain your forces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lion of Judah: The War for Ethiopia, 1935-1941 is a two-player wargame simulating two campaigns located in the Horn of Africa - Italy vs. Ethiopia in 1935-1936, and the British Commonwealth and Ethiopia vs. Italy in 1940-1941. The scenarios use a common rule set combined with scenario-specific rules. Regular units are mostly divisions, brigades and regiments, while irregular units include warrior levies and tribal bands. Armor, transports, air power, and headquarters (which represent corps-level artillery assets, engineers, and administrative and command centers) are also represented. Lion of Judah has one large-hex map and approximately 400 counters representing Italian, Ethiopian, Commonwealth, French and German units.  In addition to the military units, there are markers to track game and unit status, as well as several Random Event markers used in the historical scenarios for added historical flavor.&#10;&#10;Colonial Warfare in Unforgiving Conditions.&#10;The campaigns for Ethiopia were fought in extremely inhospitable terrain. Logistics was one of the key issues of these battles. This is simulated in Lion of Judah by supply counters: everything a modern army requires to operate, from replacements to ammunition to artillery, has to be moved across the harsh terrain. Western units have far more firepower that the Ethiopians, but much lower movement rates. This simulates the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; rate of movement for western units when moving across difficult terrain. They had to move through jungles, mountains and marshes, relying on local guides to move through this mostly-unmapped terrain.  Supplies often had to go by air due to lack of a road network. Western forces may attempt to move at a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; movement rate (using the &ldquo;Forced march&rdquo; table), but this entails risks: units may get lost, run out of supply, lose their pack mules, or even be ambushed. Unlike the Italians, the Ethiopian army of 1935 was a medieval-style collection of warriors, with little or no central command. This is simulated through activation rules: Ethiopian forces are activated randomly, and some may end up not activating at all during an entire turn! The Italian player may also &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; certain Ethiopian formations into inactivity, as they did historically.&#10;&#10;Conventional and Guerrilla Warfare.&#10;Both historical campaigns, have conventional and unconventional warfare. In 1935-36, the Ethiopian army engaged a conventional Italian army in the north and south, while at the same time fighting rebels and tribal guerrillas in the far off corners of the Empire. In 1940-41, it was the Italian Army who had to face both a conventional, professional enemy (the Commonwealth forces) and Ethiopian guerrillas and Commonwealth special forces operating in its rear.&#10;To win, players must successfully manage both kinds of warfare, guerrilla and conventional. When invading Ethiopia in 1935-36, the Italian player must invest resources to encourage trouble within the Ethiopian Empire, recruiting irregulars, bribing and encouraging rebellions. If the Italian player concentrates exclusively on the conventional military front, then the Ethiopian Empire will have a chance to concentrate its armies and achieve a resounding, glorious Adowa-like victory over the Italian invaders.&#10;&#10;Similarly, in the 1940-41 campaign the Commonwealth/Ethiopian player must raise rebel forces to force the Italian player to use desperately needed units to defend their lines of communications and cities. Furthermore, the Italian player has an 'Italian Prestige Index', which determines the chance of internal revolts.  He must attack British held territories and outposts as much as possible to keep his Prestige high, especially early in the game before the full might of the Commonwealth army can be brought to bear. The uncertainty regarding Italian defeats in Libya  (handled via event chits) adds further randomness as it is not guaranteed that the British and Indian units that were historically available in January 1941 will arrive in time for the Allied counteroffensive in Ethiopia.&#10;&#10;Diplomacy and other Chrome&#10;A random events system similar to that used in The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 accounts for political and diplomatic events, rebellions in the rear, the arrival of combat units, the purchase of foreign weapons (in the 1935-1936 Scenario) or the arrival of blockade runners to Italian East Africa. Pressure exerted by various political actors is also simulated through events chits: for instance, the event &ldquo;Pressure by Mussolini&rdquo; (1935-36 Scenario), simulates pressure from il Duce when he demanded a rapid advance on to Addis Ababa before he lost the favorable international situation. The Italian player may use chemical weapons, but at the risk of losing Italian Victory Points if the &ldquo;League of Nations&rdquo; event is pulled that turn.&#10;&#10;Special units and rules cover the above mentioned Italian chemical warfare, as well as road building, supply dumps, Italian fuel and ammo shortages (1940-1941 scenario), open cities, the Red Sea Flotilla and blockade runners. The countersheet includes exotic units, such as the Somali Camel Corps, the Italo-German motorized company (a German volunteer unit that was recruited among German refugees from Kenya and crews of interned German ships), and Mission 101 or Gideon Force (Orde Wingate&rsquo;s guerrilla force operating in the Italian rear).&#10;&#10;",

As an expansion, much of the 1984 edition of Axis &amp; Allies was needed to play this expansion.&#10;&#10;The World at War 1939-1945 2nd Edition, published in 1993, balanced some of the gameplay and added some new ideas but retained the same glossy 24&quot;x36&quot; color map and pieces.&#10;&#10;The 3rd Edition, published in 1996, continued to improve gameplay balance and added Atomic Bombs to the technology development. After developing A-bomb technology, players spend 6 IPCs to buy one, which must be delivered via a Heavy Bomber (also a required technology). Damage to a land or sea zone by an A-bomb eliminates 20 IPCs worth of enemy units and renders the territory desolate (-5 IPC value, with +1 restoration each turn for two turns), causing devastation to the economy as well as military of an opposing player.&#10;&#10;Now in its 4th edition, The World at War includes a hardback map (replacing the poster-paper map of earlier editions), with some minor rule revisions over the 3rd ed, and this is a mature game in it's own right with differences significant enough for any A&amp;A fan to appreciate, beyond all of the &quot;official&quot; editions published in recent years.&#10;&#10;There are new unit types, such as Destoyers, Paratroopers, SS Panzers and SS Panzergrenadiers, Russian Guards, Partisans. US Marines, Rangers and Armored Infantry, U-Boat Pens (complete with the plastic figurines and/or special rules).&#10;&#10;The rules introduce a variety of simulation fidelity enhancements, such as Banzai and Kamikaze attacks for the Japanese player, a Fall of France rule, Peacetime Production rules for the US and USSR, etc.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Axis & Allies&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    World At War Expansion&#10;    World at War: Update 2005 Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But be careful: if all of your remaining stock holdings crash, it is possible to be eliminated before the game is even over.&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1961 as Broker by the Spencer-Murray Corporation of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.&#10;&#10;The original box is white, with lettering and logo in black, very basic, drab, and uninspiring. Yet this obscure title was quite a gem considering the limitation of games to choose from during its day.&#10;&#10;In 1967 it was re-published by the German firm Otto Maier Verlag, which is the ancestor of Ravensburger Verlag. Numerous re-publications followed (1972, 1977 and others) including at least one which gave the rules in German, English and Italian. It was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.&#10;Components list for these editions are as follows: 160 stock certificates, 68 Market Action cards, 4 price markers, play money, stock price board.&#10;&#10;The 1983 (9th edition) by Ravensburger changes the title slightly to B&ouml;rsenspiel instead of Das B&ouml;rsenspiel and the original rules heavily. Although this set is well-designed and much nicer on the eyes, the bland original version featured larger (regular card deck) size action cards. An extra set of 18 &quot;risk&quot; cards replacing 18 market cards had been added and they act as event cards that immediately effect changes in the market. They cause the unfortunate player who draws one to play it instead of a market card, a chaotic effect that some players will not like.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The wicked witch Grimelda has cursed the wizard Akata and imprisoned him in a magic book. As you are brave adventurers, you venture into the magic labyrinth to free the wizard &ndash; but you cannot do this without the help of its inhabitants. Visit the inhabitants and bring them certain items. You will receive coveted magic stones as a reward! The first player to fill his magic key with the magic stones and return to his starting field wins. But beware! Danger lurks everywhere...&#10;&#10;In Das Elektronik Labyrinth, designer Reiner Knizia marries his facility for electronics in board games (e.g., Wer war's? and Die Insel) with Max J. Kobbert's long-running Labyrinth series of games from Ravensburger.&#10;&#10;The basic game play is the same as in Labyrinth. The board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles slide in and out of the rows created by the fixed tiles to make up the labyrinth. One tile stands outside the labyrinth, and on a player's turn, he takes this tile and slides it into a row, moving all the tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board, which becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.&#10;&#10;After inserting the tile, the player may move his pawn. Each player starts on a corner of the game board and must reach the starting location diagonally opposite. If he manages to do so, he gains a number of magic stones. A player can also acquire magic stones from the inhabitants of the labyrinth. If a player lands on an inhabitant, it tells the players what item it desires. A player who finds the item, with items being scattered throughout the labyrinth, can deliver it to the inhabitant for a reward. What's more, an inhabitant may give a visiting player a treasure chest to be delivered to another inhabitant, also for a reward.&#10;&#10;In order to complete his magic key and free the wizard, a player needs fifteen magic stones. The first player that returns to his starting location with a complete key wins.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a &quot;book&quot; containing electronics. This book takes care of all the interactions with the inhabitants of the labyrinth. Whenever a player interacts with an inhabitant, he pushes the corresponding buttons from the book, and the book will respond by telling the player his assignment, reward, etc.&#10;&#10;",

It can be played competitively, cooperatively, or in solo mode. Each player plays a Nano, Jack, or Glaive. Each character is described with an adjective (&quot;I am a learned...&quot;), noun (&quot;...nano...&quot;), and verb phrase (&quot;...who rides the lightning&quot;).&#10;&#10;Characters will explore one of the nine kingdoms of The Steadfast&mdash;or they may venture into the even stranger lands of the Beyond. Each kingdom is illustrated with a set of five region cards. Over the course of a quick five-round game, the characters will simultaneously explore the starting region on round 1, then continue out to the region on the far reaches of the kingdom. In a standard game of nine rounds, they'll then head back home on the other side of the card.&#10;&#10;Each round, characters will choose how much time to spend performing actions with their five skills &mdash; scouting the wilderness, tinkering with cyphers and oddities, charming allies, combating creatures, and focusing on skill advancement &mdash; and then bid against the other heroes for the choicest cards. Each phase, a character can adventure in the town, where rewards are predictable and creatures not so dangerous. Or they can head out to the wilderness, where strange cyphers have unpredictable powers and the creatures look to bash you into oblivion.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simultaneous and every action is rewarded with victory points. Whoever has the most points at the end is the most legendary adventurer.&#10;&#10;In co-op mode, characters can work together to defeat the creatures and garner the relics, but there's a catch: the wilderness is trying to kill the town. Cards flip off the wilderness deck, and the characters have to take them out before the creatures destroy the town locations and the relics and quests make it impossible for them to win. Or a character can go it alone in solo mode, which is like that except no one is there to help.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.&#10;&#10;When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.&#10;&#10;So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.&#10;&#10;And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).&#10;&#10;There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "With It Or On It is the first wargame in the Shields &amp; Swords Ancients series. Like its Medieval era cousin Shields &amp; Swords, this series takes a broad brush approach to simulating battles, this time of the Ancient period, with an emphasis on speed and playability. While the basic philosophy and the core system of using Command Markers to activate Wings remains the same, each game in this Ancients line is designed from the ground-up to incorporate elements specific to its period and style of warfare.&#10;&#10;This first game looks at six battles fought during the Greco-Persian and Peloponnesian Wars. Hoplite units that are attacking may use the Combat Class of the best hoplite in the line, giving them an advantage over heavy and light infantry formations. As a result of combat, units become exhausted, but these results may be distributed elsewhere in the line - a break occurs when there are no fresh units that can satisfy the result. Break the enemy line at the right time in the right place, and it will crumble in a disastrous rout. Maintaining pressure on the enemy while managing the morale of your own men is crucial to deciding the battle, and with it, the fate of empires.&#10;&#10;",

Give the blue to one player, the orange the other. Shuffle the black deck and set it face-down.&#10;&#10;To start, the blue player places 25 bird cards face-up on the playing surface, in any design within an 8x8 grid. This is the &quot;Flock&quot; in which all cards must stay connected (share a side) at all times.&#10;&#10;The orange player has first turn, and may play 1 fox on top of any bird to eat it, and remove it from play. Next, players take turns drawing 1 card from the black deck, which identifies the number of moves a player may make during a turn. Foxes may only move by pouncing on a bird and taking its place. Birds can fly, and therefore may move to an open place on the invisible 8x8 grid. If a &quot;Plus&quot; card is drawn by the orange player, he or she adds a fox to the game. If drawn by the blue player, he or she adds 3 more birds. During play no move may be taken that separates even one bird from the flock.&#10;&#10;The orange player wins by eating all birds. The blue player wins by surrounding the fox(es) with 8 birds (on all 4 sides and 4 corners).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Barclay is a two-player game of low/medium complexity about the intelligence war between the Allies and their Abwehr counterparts in the Mediterranean theater in 1942-1943.&#10;&#10;With the Axis powers ejected from North Africa, there was debate as to where the Allies might strike next. At Casablanca (January 14-24, 1943), Roosevelt and Churchill agreed the next target: Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, would begin July 9 1943 &mdash; but there was a problem. The Axis powers suspected Sicily would be the target, and knew there were deception activities in motion to attempt to mislead them about what they already knew.&#10;&#10;On top of this, with Operation Husky already planned for early July, there was little time for Allied intelligence to work with. In these six months, Allied intelligence had to create sufficient disinformation to persuade their intelligence counterparts, the Abwehr, that the primary attack and a suspected secondary attack would be aimed elsewhere within the Mediterranean. This essential intelligence operation was dubbed &quot;Operation Barclay&quot;.&#10;&#10;Operation Barclay puts players in the shoes of competing military intelligence directors who are attempting to mask or learn the truth about the Allied invasion plans for 1943. The Abwehr must attempt to learn where the Allies intend to land next. The London Controlling Section (LCS), the core intelligence agency responsible for Allied intelligence, must prevent the Abwehr from discovering the truth.&#10;&#10;The LCS player uses a variable set-up, placing tiles face down to establish where amongst the five geo-strategic options in the Mediterranean a primary and a secondary offensive will occur. Over the course of the six game months, the Abwehr player attempts to win sufficient evidence tokens to be able to turn enough of these tiles face-up to reveal where the Allied offensives will come. Every evidence token the LCS player wins prevents another tile from being revealed.&#10;&#10;To win evidence tokens, players build hands of five cards to take tricks, similar to poker. While having the best hand will secure two  evidence tokens, correctly betting after each player reveals the first three cards of each hand on who will have the best five-card hand is worth three evidence tokens. Thus, getting and bluffing and seeding disinformation is more important than being lucky with a card draw. In addition, each player competes for another evidence token by having the most raid or reconnaissance icons on their cards.&#10;&#10;Further, players have ways to manipulate the decks from which they draw. They may create a double-cross deck, allowing them to leave cards useful to them face down in a deck to draw from when they choose later &mdash; unless the other player takes those cards instead...but perhaps the player who planted those cards was bluffing and hoping the other player would waste their draw on a useless card...&#10;&#10;Alternatively, players may draw from their own dedicated deck to augment their hands with unique abilities inspired by historical figures, events, and capabilities. The LCS has access to Ultra &mdash; decrypts of German codes &mdash; but this alone will not be enough if it's not used carefully.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Joined by the Druids of the Welsh isle of Mona, the British rebels defeated the Roman Ninth Legion and razed Britain's two largest cities, Londinium and Camulodunum. &#10;But the Roman governor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, marshalled two legions and processed to destroy a Briton force ten times its size, destroying the revolt.  Boudicca disappeared from history, probably taking poison.  As for Paulinus, his repression in the aftermath was so severe that Tacitus, in his famed phrase, described it as &quot;making a desert and calling it peace.&quot;&#10;&#10;Druid is a vivid simulation of Boudicca's Rebellion, a fast-paced board wargame of Ancient &quot;guerilla warfare.&quot;  Barbarian and Roman players battle across first-century Britain, burning villages and sacking towns.  The undisciplined Britons are initially strong, but must rally the disparate tribes of the island in revolt against the well-trained legions of Imperial Rome.  The Roman forces begin as weak, but can call on powerful reinforcements.  The Britons must hit cities and melt into the vast forests of the island where they cannot be found by Rome's legionaries. A wealth of &quot;chrome&quot; rules make the game interesting and provide repeated play value; rules are provided for tribal revolts, hidden deployment, legion activation, Druid invocation, and berserk units.  &#10;An unusual wargame on an unusual topic, Druid proves the claim that some of history's least known conflicts can make some of its best games.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Boudicca: The Warrior Queen&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the fantastic world of Tellus, powerful tremors unearthed the ruins of the ancient structure permeated with magical power. Sorcerers from all over the land gathered, their goal to possess this raw power in form of Elementum particles, crucial for spellcasting and creation of enchancing Power Crystals.&#10;This power, hidden for hundreds of years, springs from the four Elemental Sources. Mages, casting elemental spells from the aspects of Earth, Fire, Air and Water take control of Elementum, gathering power &ndash; and the one who shall gather the most will uncover the nature&rsquo;s ultimate secrets and become the world&rsquo;s greatest elementalist.&#10;&#10;Elementum is a card game for 1 to 4 players aging 10 and up, taking around 15 minutes to play. Players draft cards, then, each player places the chosen card in his set in the corresponding column next to the common Elemental Source.&#10;If the card has an instant effect it&rsquo;s resolver immediately, but most will have effect only during the final scoring.&#10;Cards can also be enchanced using Power Crystals, or interact with the common card pool.&#10;After all spell cards are placed in sets the game ends and scoring begins. Each player in turn analyses each card from the set. The player with the most Elementum Particles (VP) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the designer, translation courtesy of BoardgameNews.com:&#10;&#10;Trapper is an adventurous family game for 2-4 trappers from 10 years old, in which players gather tiles lying on the table. Trapper is suited especially well for two players.&#10;&#10;Players are trappers in the Canadian wilderness, catching wild animals in the forests and lakes and searching for fungus and herbs. You ship your prey in canoes. As soon as one of your canoes is full, you sell the goods at the market. Both in the gathering of your prey and in the filling of your canoes, you need clever plans and foresight. Who will make the most valuable captures? The winner is the player who possesses the most money.&#10;&#10;The game offers two different versions: A basic version in which luck plays a larger share and a somewhat more demanding version for tactically-minded players.&#10;&#10;The basic game of Trapper is a simple game in the style of Verflixxt and Celtica that's suitable for a wide target audience. Good luck and tactics are about equal on the scales.&#10;&#10;The somewhat more demanding version offers more tactical possibilities. How should one advance with the animal gathering? Which is more lucrative, getting a few larger and very valuable canoes or bringing many small canoes with different species to the market? Both strategies can lead to success.&#10;&#10;",
