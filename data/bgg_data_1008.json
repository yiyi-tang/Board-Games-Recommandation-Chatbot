By bidding clich&eacute;s on each episode they capture keywords associated with their hidden motivations and compete to see who has final say on the fate of their story.&#10;&#10;While there is no winner, per se, the character who secured the most of their keywords reveals the post session denouement of their character last, getting final say on plot outcomes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board and card abstract skirmish level combat game for 2 players depicting the battle between Asgardians and either Frost Giants, Dark Elves or Marauders.&#10;&#10;Play is conducted on an 8x8 board using chits, figures or miniatures to represent units. Dependant on scenario several spaces on the board will be marked as impassable, representing pits, walls, and other obstacles.&#10;&#10;Units are described in a series of tables but have a hit point value of between 1 and 9, have specific capabilities and characteristics, and may have associated special cards.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck. Cards are of varying types: Move, Ranged Attack, Hand to Hand Attack, Defence, Combo and Special.  Move and Attack cards have an associated range.&#10;&#10;The units used are dependent on scenario (four are provided). Each player places one unit on each square of his back two rows. Units may not stack.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Fate Phase&#10;-    Draw 3 cards.  Max hand size = 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;2.   Move Phase&#10;-    Play (discard) a Move card to move one of your units. The move card has a number. This is the number of spaces the unit moves. Moves can be diagonal or orthogonal. &ldquo;Knight&rdquo; type move cards allow a unit to move like a knight in chess. Instead of moving just one unit in any direction, you have the option of moving 2 or 3 units forward the indicated number of spaces using a single move card.  Units cannot move through other units.&#10;&#10;3.   Fight Phase&#10;-    Play (discard) an Attack card to have a unit attack. The attack card has a number. This is the range of the attack. Attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. &ldquo;Knight&rdquo; type attack cards produce an attack with a range like a knight in chess. Units cannot attack through other units.&#10;-    Every attack does a base of 1 damage (target loses 1 hit). Use chits or coins to record damage.  A unit reduced to 0 hits is killed or incapacitated and removed from the board. &#10;-    Your opponent may play defence cards to negate your attack.&#10;-    A unit is knocked back in the direction of the attack. If a unit is blocked by another unit the other unit is also knocked back (like a row of dominoes).  If a unit is knocked into an impassable space or off the board it is destroyed.&#10;&#10;Victory conditions are scenario specific.  After 15 turns, if there is no victory, one side retreats and the battle is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

In 1945 Nazis, using flying-saucers, escaped to and colonized the dark side of the moon. They call themselves the Fourth Reich. Ever since, and unknown to us, they&rsquo;ve been plotting their return. Their fleet is currently in low earth Orbit, bombarding New York with large moon rocks and sending down waves of Attack saucers. Unknown to the Nazis and to each other, each of the major Earth nations has secretly weaponized their communication and science satellites. These have now banded together to fight off the Nazi Invasion Fleet.&#10;&#10;Play is conducted on an 8x8 grid using chits, figures or miniatures to represent units.  Units start on the back two rows of the player&rsquo;s side of the board. Units are of various classes (Dreadnought, Carrier, Flying Saucer Squadron, Large, Medium and Small ships). Each unit has a designated hit value, and may have specific capabilities. Players can elect to play from 3 different scenarios though gameplay is common to all three.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck of movement, attack, defence and special cards.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tactical Phase&#10;         Draw 3 cards.

    "Description": "A card and board Game for 2-4+ players. The theme is the finances and status of the great country houses built in England and Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries. Each player controls one noble who is making improvements to his estate.&#10;&#10;The board is a circular track with 16 spaces. Pawns are utilised to track movement around the track&#10;&#10;There are 2 decks of cards: The Income Deck and the Status Deck. The top 4 cards of each deck are always kept face up and are available for purchase. &#10;-    The income deck has six types of cards: Agriculture, Mining, Industry, Trade, Titles and Credit. These 6 card types correspond to six of the spaces on the game board. Each card has a cost and an income value. &#10;-    The status deck has six types of cards:  Architecture, Style, Collections, Accommodations, Features and Construction. These 6 card types correspond to six of the spaces on the game board. Each card has a cost and a status value&#10;&#10;Each player gets 20 coins and starts with an Estate Size = 10. Players elect to be one of 5 different aristocrats which gives them a unique starting position (larger estate, extra coins etc.)&#10;&#10;On your turn roll one die. You may go either forwards or backwards. If you land on a space that has one or more matching cards face up, you may buy them and place face up in front of you OR if you land on a space that has an income type matching income cards you own you may collect income from them equal to their total income value. &#10;-   If you land on the Country space you may discard all the face up income cards and go again. &#10;-   If you land on the London space you must pay 2 Coins then you may discard all the face up status cards and go again. &#10;-    If you land on the Land space you may pay 2D6 Coins to increase the size of your estate by 1. &#10;-    If you land on the Rent space gain 1D6 Coins.&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player has more than 30 improvements. End game scoring is then conducted as follows:&#10;-    Add up the status points of all of your status cards.&#10;-    Get an extra 30 points for each complete set owned &ndash; a set is one card from each of the 6 status types.&#10;The player with the most status wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card, dice and storytelling game for 2-6+ players. Each player takes the role of one of the Gods of Magic. The Gods create magical realms and fill them with all manner of strangeness. The God whose realms are the most complete and fantastical becomes the current Chief amongst them.&#10;&#10;Players share a common Deck. There are 5 suits of 40 cards each:  Location, Action, Entities, Descriptors and Objects. Each card has a victory point value between 1 and 10.&#10;&#10;Each player has his own domain - a player&rsquo;s part of the table where he keeps his realms. A realm is a group of cards that must include one location card and are placed face up in a separate group within your domain. A complete realm contains at least one card of each of the 5 suits.&#10;&#10;To start each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards. Each player may play up to 3 cards to their domain to make 1 or more realms.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Draw Phase&#10;-    Draw 1 card and place it in your hand. Max hand size is 10 cards. Discard excess cards at the end of this phase.&#10;&#10;2.   Play Phase&#10;-    Play one card from your hand to add to one of your Realms or to create a new realm. If creating a new realm, the card played must be a location card.&#10;&#10;3.   Dice Phase&#10;-    Roll the D10 and consult the Magic Table. The die result will have an effect such as discarding cards, drawing extra card, playing an extra turn, etc.&#10;&#10;The realms and what happens to them tell stories. In the spirit of the game players are expected to say something about a realm when they modify it, thus describing the whims and actions of the Gods of Magic.  This is usually a statement listing all the cards within the realm and how they interact with each other. This may include elements not listed on the cards themselves. If any description fails to meet the playing groups standards, the play may be stopped by the other player and the offending player must make a different action.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to score 200 or more victory points. If 2 or more players score 200+ at the same time, the player with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;",

There are two ways to start the game, in fast version each player will have a &quot;foundation&quot; card, and in normal version players start empty handed.&#10;&#10;In turn, the active player will first roll a six-sided die. On a 6, he loses his turn. On a 1, a 3, a 4 or a 5, he has the choice between drawing 1 &quot;construction&quot; card or 2 &quot;tree&quot; cards. On a 2, he performs the action &quot;draw&quot; twice. Then, if he can, if he wants, he can play cards from his hand. The goal is to build the houses of the &quot;Moigeux&quot;, small creatures who think only of their material goods and who never cease to build ever bigger or always more ... To build, we will have to make combinations. For example, to build a roof, you will need the &quot;roof&quot; card and a &quot;green wood&quot; card + &quot;brown wood&quot; card. You discard the raw material and place your roof in front of you.&#10;&#10;There are action cards that let you interact with other players or defend yourself against action cards from other players. &#10;Once your turn is over, you must not have more than 10 cards in hand.&#10;&#10;How do I win?&#10;&#10;When the &quot;Construction&quot; stack is empty, the game ends. The points in the top right corner on the &quot;Construction&quot; cards are counted and the one with the most points is declared &quot;Grand Vainqueur&quot; or Winner.&#10;&#10;",

Major game play mechanics include hand management, press your luck, voting and trading, negotiation, and take that!  The game is played over seven rounds, with each round consisting of an election phase to determine the group's leader, and a filibuster phase to block the policy revealed that round.&#10;&#10;The leader is responsible for increasing the filibuster time to meet or exceed the minimum number of hours required to successfully block the policy. They also interact with the Time Deck, which is full of events that affect the players and will typically cause the end of the round. Non-leader players during a round act as supporting Senators that play assists and pass cards to the leader to help effectively block the policy and meet the Filibuster requirements for the round.&#10;&#10;If at any time the players fail to block 4 policies, everyone loses! If all 7 rounds are completed and at least 4 policies have been successfully blocked, the Senator who earned the most influence (rewarded based on performance while leading a filibuster, as well as playing assists and passing cards) is the true winner!&#10;&#10;So, be sure to work with your colleagues to prevent too many policies from passing through... but always look for ways to help yourself a little more than your fellow Senators so that you come out on top!&#10;&#10;",

The first player to visit all of their destinations and return home is the winner.  The game has a deck of Interstate cards which allows for interactive card play as players can help their own cause or hinder other players' travel.&#10;&#10;Interstate is presented as an easy-to-learn basic game but also has several optional variants that can be used to spice up the basic game.  Because of the randomness and unpredictability inherent in the play of the game, as well as the variants, Interstate has excellent replay value.&#10;&#10;Most games of Interstate are close; it is rare to have a runaway winner. The play of the cards helps to rein in anyone who gets too much of a lead over the other players.  There will always be unpleasant events that will hinder your game but basically the person who can most efficiently plan out the course of visiting their destinations will have the best chance of winning.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card and dice game for 2-5 players.  Each player controls 1 town in Alaska and develops his town in order to score the most points.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck comprising resource (investment) cards and event cards.  The deck comes in three parts.  All the &ldquo;early&rdquo; cards are shuffled to make the top third of the decks. All the &ldquo;late&rdquo; cards are shuffled to make the bottom third of the deck.&#10;&#10;There are 13 resource card types:  Indians, Mines, Fish, Wood, Ships, Ground, Air, Government, Military, Oil, Agriculture, Service, and Tourism.  Resource cards have an associated cost, score and revenue value.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 2 dollars.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 2 phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Revenue Phase&#10;-    Gain 1 dollar for free. &#10;-    Roll 1D6 or 2D6.  Gain revenue from every one of your resources whose score matches your roll. &#10;-    If your roll did not match any of your cards gain a second dollar for free.  &#10;-    Dollars normally come from the Bank. If, however a resource is marked &ldquo;ticket&rdquo;, then 1 dollar comes from an opponent instead of the Bank.&#10;&#10;2.   Investment Phase&#10;-    The top 3 cards of the deck are turned face up. &#10;-    You may buy one card for its face value. &#10;-    You may buy a second card for double its cost. &#10;-    You may buy the third card for triple its cost. &#10;-    You may buy a fourth card for quadruple the cost and so on. &#10;-    Cards not bought are set aside and can be bought later by any player on their turn in addition to and/or instead of the top 3 that are always revealed.  &#10;-    If the card is an event card it affects the player who draws them. Event cards, once drawn and played, are removed from the game.  If an event card allows a free buy, it must be of a card set aside or drawn this turn; if there are no candidates, it has no effect.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more cards left to draw.  All players in order may ten spend the last of their dollars. Scoring is undertaken as follows:&#10;-    Score 1 VP for every card you own.&#10;-    Score 2 VP for every Government and Military Card.  &#10;-    Score 3 VP for every Oil and Tourism Card. &#10;-    Score 2 VP if you have the most cards of a type (check all 13 types)&#10;The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Exceptions include units being carried such as a soldier carrying a wounded comrade or a captured alien or flying units passing over or hovering over other units&#10;-    Play an attack card to have a unit attack.  The attack card has a number which is the range of the attack.  All attacks do a base of 1 hit of damage. A unit reduced to 0 hits is killed. &#10;-    Your opponent may play defence cards to negate damage.  A defence effect negates a base of 1 hit of damage.&#10;&#10;3.   End Phase&#10;-    Max hand size = 5 cards (4 if you only have 2 units, or 3 if you only have one unit left).  Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the first to achieve complete destruction of all opposing units.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Background:&#10;War started in the year 2200, it was inevitable... metal combined with technology had turned into humanity&rsquo;s worst enemy.&#10;In the present day some cities still survive, protected by huge metallic walls, labyrinths and gates to prepare a first line of defense before any threats reach the inner parts of the city.&#10;Build and pilot your Mech armor, it&rsquo;s the only thing you can really trust to stay alive when venturing into the dangerous wasteland.&#10;Money is worthless nowadays, but search the wasteland for scrap metal, cables, and electronics, you may even find weapons and lost tech from the Mech Wars. Whatever you find in the wasteland can be used to upgrade your weapons and armor, or as currency in the cities.&#10;Pirates, mercenaries and psychos attack the cities in an attempt to conquer them, to loot and steal as much scrap metal and technology as possibly can.&#10;Intro:&#10;The Last Mechs is a cooperative exploration game for 1 to 4 players, a dungeon crawler set in a post-apocalyptic future. Includes a campaign mode that will guide you through the adventure with a comic book illustrated by David Daza. &#10;Aside from the campaign, every hero will have their own short comic that narrates their personal stories, which you can unveil by searching for clues in the cities.&#10;With highly detailed pre-assembled miniatures ready to play.&#10;You can choose from 4 different heroes: Paul &ldquo;The Legend&rdquo; a former army man turned mercenary, Karl the mechanic with his D-Sherpa droid always by his side, Lorna and her large modified cargo Mech, and Gork the smuggler.&#10;The Last Mechs includes some RPG elements, since the heroes attributes include Mech piloting, repairing, exploring, and communications, and they can learn new skills by spending experience points.&#10;There are different phases in TLM:&#10;A travel phase, when one of the heroes must guide the group while trying to avoid the grave dangers that plague the wasteland.&#10;A search phase when you may look for scrap, electronics and cables (the most valued resources), or even find standard or lost tech weapons and armor that you can repair. Additionally, different adventures and events unrelated to the campaign may trigger during your journey.&#10;By the end of the travel phase, if you haven&rsquo;t reached a city, you must set camp on the dangerous wasteland and take shifts to guard the camp.&#10;During the guard phase, the heroes will decide how to split the guard rounds and will solve events in the dark of the wasteland. Also, the mechanic can repair the Mechs and the droid can build ammunitions.&#10;Your party will earn fame the longer you stay in the wasteland, which will give you benefits in the cities, but the danger levels will increase the longer you venture into the wasteland, making it harder for your team to survive.&#10;The few cities that still stand have metallic labyrinths that protect them from enemies, which you must pass through to access the cities.&#10;In the cities you will have access to: (depending on the city)&#10;1- Canteen: Find clues about your story and rumors.&#10;2- Doctor: Heal your heroes.&#10;3- Mech garage: Repair and upgrade your Mechs and equipment.&#10;4- Tattoo parlor: To get temporary boosts for your skills.&#10;5-Supplies: Purchase weapons and ammo.&#10;&#10;Kickstarter Prelaunch:&#10;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/juegorama/last-mechs&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There is a set of 64 counters to be placed on the spaces of the board representing 16 districts (of 6 different types) and 48 restaurants (6 each of 8 different types).  A space on the board may only ever contain 1 district or 1 restaurant.&#10;&#10;To start the 16 districts are distributed to the board such that each row gets 2 random districts randomly placed. All restaurant counters are in a pile called the build pile which is shuffled and placed face down next to the board.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a set of 20 tokens, 10 coins, 4 random restaurant counters and 4 cards from a common card deck. Cards are of three types: Number, Income and Improvement.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising has 6 phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Investment Phase&#10;-    The active player receives 1 Coin. &#10;-    If you have the most restaurants of a given type (for each type) get one extra coin.&#10;&#10;2.   Recruit Phase&#10;-    The active player draws 1 card and puts it in his hand.&#10;&#10;3.   Build Phase&#10;-    You may build one restaurant. This costs 10 coins and the restaurant must come from your restaurant pool. &#10;-    When a restaurant is built, draw a replacement counter from the build pile. &#10;-    Place the restaurant counter on an open space on the board with one of your tokens on top of it.  When building a restaurant, you must also discard a number card and the restaurant must be placed on a row or column matching that number. &#10;-    You may not build a restaurant adjacent to another of the same type.&#10;&#10;4.   Improvement Phase&#10;-    You may play one Improvement card. This costs 5 Coins. &#10;-    Place improvements face up on the table in front of you. &#10;-    You can have a maximum of 5 improvements.&#10;&#10;5.   Income Phase&#10;-    You must either play an income card or initiate a random income sequence. &#10;-    When playing a restaurant income card all restaurants of that type earn income. &#10;They gain 1 coin for every adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) district.  When playing a district income card all restaurants adjacent to that type of district earn 1 coin each. &#10;All players earn income, not just the active player. &#10;-   To initiate a random income sequence roll 2D8 to get a random space on the board. If that space is a restaurant, that restaurant earns income for each adjacent district. If that space is a district, each adjacent restaurant earns 1 coin. &#10;-   If you have the only restaurants of a given type on the board they gain 1 star.  All restaurants start with a base rating of 1 star.  Certain Improvements and bonuses increase the number of stars. When a restaurant receives income multiply by its star rating to get the number of coins it earns.&#10;&#10;End Phase&#10;Discard cards in your hand in excess of 4.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when one of the following happens: &#10;-    Any player runs out of tokens to use.&#10;-    All restaurants of a single type are built.&#10;-    Players go through the deck twice. &#10;The player with the most coins at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flamme Rouge: Peloton, the first expansion for Flamme Rouge, offers a chase group of four riders (pink and white rouleurs and sprinters) that allows the base game to be played with up to six players. All 5-6 player games are played with a breakaway tile and 1-3 supply zone tiles. These can also be added to your games at lower player counts.&#10;&#10;The box cover shows the iconic cobblestone races that are represented with new tiles in the game; these tiles are mostly one space wide, occasionally two, and don't allow slip streaming.&#10;&#10;Flamme Rouge: Peloton includes variants for solo play and for games with up to twelve players, each controlling only one rider.&#10;&#10;",
