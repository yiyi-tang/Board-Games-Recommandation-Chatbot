    "Description": "This set is an extension of Phalanx. Where this set differs is in that we have concentrated on speed of play while maintaining a good level of accuracy. We hope this is achieved by using efficient game mechanics that take a pure mathematical approach. This game contains many radical systems, terminology and mechanics of which combat resolution by one die is at the forefront. A lot of effort and thinking went into this game, our hope is that you enjoy gaming with Into Glory Ride.&#10;&#10;Of course, your initial reaction may be &quot;1500 - 1900, just not possible&quot;. However, while developing and testing Phalanx we started to see no logical reason to subdivide the period of 1500AD to 1900AD into the classic periods of Renaissance, Marlburian, Napoleonic, ACW and Colonial. We see the period from a different perspective, that of the increasing lethality of firearms and their effect on the field. Physics and physical constrains are our guidelines. In other areas not much changed, a Soldier at the battle of Omdurman would not find himself too out of place at Waterloo. However, his weapons being much more lethal. The dense close order of Line Infantry (1700ish) gave way to the thick skirmishing lines of the ACW and Colonial period. Even WW1 was fought using 19th Century thinking, albeit with massive fire power. Just be incompetent and you'll game quite realistically.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When at least one feature scores points for any player, you resolve everything based on the currently active tiles, then you place those tiles on the bottom of their stacks, making the next-in-tile of each type the active tile. Some tiles give you bonuses, others penalties, so time the scoring carefully while the surveyors are on your side!&#10;&#10;This expansion was first released as a print-and-play through Hans im Gl&uuml;ck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These scenarios introduce new rules and experiences that will challenge even the hardiest Resident Evil&trade; board game veterans.&#10;&#10;As you play, you&rsquo;ll visit three new locations: the Raccoon City General Hospital, the City Park, and the Dead Factory. To represent these eerie areas, the expansion includes brand new tiles with exciting new artwork&mdash;as well as a special, extra-large boss fight tile.&#10;&#10;In fact, City of Ruin includes two massive new bosses&mdash;with bases so large they take up multiple squares. These powerful enemies have considerably higher stamina, can perform much more devastating attacks, and can viciously shove characters out of their path when they move.&#10;&#10;In short, they&rsquo;re not to be trifled with. Weapons won&rsquo;t be enough to defeat them. Instead, players will need to be clever in how they use their environment to defeat these terrible foes. But, of course, the bosses aren&rsquo;t alone. City of Ruin adds three new enemy types and twelve new enemy miniatures to Resident Evil&trade; 3: The Board Game. Each one of these enemies is dangerous in their own right, forcing players to learn new strategies to escape or defeat them.&#10;Still, don&rsquo;t worry too much. You won&rsquo;t be without help.&#10;&#10;To assist you in facing these terrible foes, City of Ruin includes new weapons, and new ammunition types for the Handgun, Shotgun, and Grenade Launcher.&#10;&#10;",

They will try to escape from an area infested with zombies, kill all they can along the way, and rescue survivors.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS: Each player needs a game sheet, a black pencil, and two others of different colors. Also, two six-sided dice of different colors are used (one light and one dark). Two dice are enough for all players.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: Draw a passable area from the entrance of the Z Zone to the exit and activate the generator to open the door. If there are several players, they must also try to get the most Victory Points to win. If you play solo, try to beat your own score.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;&#10;1. Roll the dice. Every player must cross out the rolled sector in his or her Sector Table. If the rolled sector is already crossed out, the player must select the previous or the next available sector in the row. If there are no available sectors in the row, you can select the last available sector of the rows above or the first available sector of the rows below. If you want to use a shelter, you can do it now.&#10;&#10;2. All players draw the sector they crossed out on their Z Zone, then they color it. You can draw it on any free square (it does not have to be adjacent to other drawn square), but it must be drawn just as shown in the Sector Table, i.e., you cannot rotate it. If the new sector is added to the passable area, color it with the appropriate color.&#10;&#10;3. If a zombie is activated, circle it. If you cannot kill all the activated zombies (by crossing out as many guns as the number of activated zombies), you lose immediately.&#10;&#10;4. You can activate the grenade if it is in the passable area.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the 20th turn, i.e., when you have drawn 20 sectors in all the 20 squares of your Z Zone. If you draw a passable area from the entrance to the exit and it has a generator within before the 20th turn, you do not win yet. If the 20th turn begins and you have not drawn a generator in your Z Zone yet, ignore the rolled sector and draw one of the two sectors which have the generator within. At the end of the 20th turn, surviving players must check if they have activated the generator and drawn a passable area from the entrance to the exit. Those who succeeded, count their Victory Points &mdash;the player with the most Victory Points is the winner. If no one succeeded, everybody loses the game.&#10;&#10;",

During this phase, players use their Action cards to deploy Agents and move goods from their sources to the Districts they wish to control. Each District has strict needs the Corporations need to supply.&#10;&#10;The Scoring Phase happens after the five-minute Action Phase ends. During that phase, the player with more Agents in a given District is said to control it and has the chance to fulfill the needs of that District, getting points for that or failing miserably. After all Districts are scored, penalties are applied based on the number of Actions cards they have left in their hands, and the winner. is determined.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blood in Space is a micro but complete set of rules for solitaire or co-op skirmish game, set on a sci-fi background. &ldquo;Micro&rdquo; refers to the small set of rules, the small time required to complete one game session and the small number of miniatures required (4-10 figures being a common range). Many micro-details are left to the player, only the &ldquo;important&rdquo; rules are included in the eighteen pages of the game.&#10;&#10;The game includes seventeen Scenarios covering iconic sci-fi scenes like exploring the planet surface, attacking an enemy base, searching an abandoned starship, freeing prisoners. Event markers placed on the Map will create the needed Fog of War and randomize the placement of enemies, events and of course loot! Terrain rules allow to quickly create different planetary conditions.&#10;&#10;Scenarios can be played individually or as part of a Campaign game: in this case a flowchart will (randomly) determine the next mission; as an example, after a &ldquo;Exploration&rdquo; mission a bad roll could send your characters on the &ldquo;Ambush&rdquo; scenario. Characters on a Campaign will be able to improve their characteristics, but with the improvement of the Reputation Level of your Crew, your enemies will also become stronger.&#10;&#10;Activation of units (friendly and enemies) is managed with a pool of activation markers, but you can never be sure that every unit will be activated. When an &ldquo;Enemy&rdquo; marker is drawn by the pool you will roll on the ENEMY ACTIVATION table in the current Scenario to determine the unit to activate and its orders.&#10;&#10; What's new in the second edition &#10;&#10;Completely redesigned starship missions, now including&#10;&#10;     21 Starship Cards&#10;     24+ Starship Tiles (300dpi)&#10;     Starship Events Table (two pages, 36 events)&#10;     New Enemies (Demons, Mutants, Insane Crews, Void Spiders)&#10;     PSI Rules: PSI powers for the characters (and for the Enemies as well)&#10;     Exoskeletons (civilian and military)&#10;     Bionics: enhance your characters with implants.&#10;     Madness rules&#10;     New Missions&#10;     New Weapons and Equipment&#10;&#10;&#10;Additional free components for the game are available on the Studium CMLXV site.&#10;&#10;Blood in Space is fully compatible with the fantasy rules for Blood on the Blade&#10;&#10;",

Pull back on the spring-loaded lever and release to fire the plunger into the back of the ball - sending it towards home plate.&#10;     With your left-hand, pull on the Batter's Line to raise and lower his arms and the bat. With your right-hand, pull back on the home plate lever to rotate your Batter's hips and swing through the ball.&#10;&#10;&#10;How to score:&#10;&#10;     If you hit the ball to a Catcher, Fielder, or Pitcher before it hits the ground - you're out!&#10;     If you ground hit the ball to a Catcher, Fielder, or Pitcher - you hit a single. (StrikeZone uses ghost runners to run the bases).&#10;     If you ground hit a ball past everyone - you hit a double or a triple based on where it rolled off the edge of the field (as marked by a 2 or a 3 on the field).&#10;     If you hit a fair ball in the air past everyone and above The Blue Monster - you hit a homer!&#10;     For an extra fun rule twist, we recommend giving human players (whoever's pitching or on defense) the ability to catch a ball in mid-air. Catch the ball before it hits the ground or the basement wall and save a run!&#10;     Strikes, balls, foul balls, outs and hitting the Batter with a pitch all follow traditional baseball scoring rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;How does a player win:&#10;Just like in Baseball, a player to score most in thier innings is a winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "TorKings is the game connoisseur&rsquo;s (geek-worthy) extreme upgrade of the classic game of alignment.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s new rules, new game options and hardware from the distant future. It's now a whole lot more than the old game of line up 4!&#10;&#10;The games now range from the classic game of Align4 (4 in a row) to TorLord &ndash; the creative mode where you win title of TorLord or TorKing and the right to change and evolve your own rules of engagement with a diversified set of tokens.&#10;&#10;In between those games are the games of TorGalor and TorKings &ndash; both radical and massive improvements to the game of alignment that truly unleash the genre&rsquo;s strategic depth and gameplay diversity to the next level.&#10;&#10;Then there&rsquo;s the new interactive cooperative team play mode that blows the dynamics out of the water even further.   A game mode that really hits the sweet spot with satisfying, engaging fun for families and friends.&#10;New Developmental Tool:  With both enhanced strategy games and interactive cooperative team play, TorKings is a new cross purposed STEM and Social IQ building tool.  Idea for developing minds and team building alike.&#10;&#10;The Geek Spectrum:  TorKings gameplay is adaptive to suit the full spectrum of players. Pick your board size, pick your game and pick your team.  Wherever you lie on the spectrum &ndash; there&rsquo;s a game option to suit.&#10;&#10;As immersive and fun as good Euro-games are they are unfortunately cursed by lengthy rules that are difficult to access, long gameplay and lengthy setup.&#10;&#10;TorKings is a complete matrix of game options to suit your occasion. The rules are super accessible, the game depth is selectable from newb to guru, the game duration is also selectable, the setup practically instant, you can play on a single, double or triple sized board and you can play one-on-one or play interactively in teams! &ndash; That&rsquo;s one freaking convenient and dynamic piece of gameware!&#10;&#10;So players of all ages can dive into the fun of the game of their choice in no time. &ndash; Quick, easy, super engaging and a load of fun!&#10;&#10;Way Back: The classic game of alignment goes back 5 decades (released as Connect4 in 1974). It&rsquo;s one of the most popular board games in the western world.  We&rsquo;ve either grown up with it (or a clone) or we&rsquo;ve been adults with kids who have played it to infinity and beyond.&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s a classic - so why change it?  The answer is that the gameplay is massively underdeveloped!&#10;The telling proof of that is the general attrition of the game by the time players hit their tweens. Albeit - they then grow up and return to the game for a similar time period with their own kids!&#10;&#10;The reasons for tween attrition are many but the most important factor is that the gameplay of chasing a single alignment is not strategically rich enough to maintain interest for naturally expanding minds.  It&rsquo;s too confined, too routine and lacks diversity.  If only those problems could be fixed&hellip;&#10;&#10;By comparison other strategic games like Go and Chess have a good following as minds mature.  Those games have the strategic richness to match and engage evolving minds.&#10;But how do you make the game of alignment strategically richer to engage growing and mature minds? The answer is layered but here are the basic elements of the solution: &#10;1.    Kill the sudden death approach. &#10;   &bull;    Getting a single alignment is fun.  But getting multiple alignments is a lot more fun - so in the new rules a side wins by getting the most alignments in a game.&#10;   &bull;    That finally opens up the new possibility of getting more points for multiple alignments.&#10;   &bull;    As the game plays on through alignments there is a far richer move and counter-move dynamic set up.   The dynamic shift to achieving the more dynamic multiple alignments while of course blocking the bigger game or your opponent.&#10;   &bull;    Such a simple and obvious rule change &ndash; but with a massive cascade of instantly compounding strategic depth and dynamics&#10;&bull;    You now also get paid for each new alignment you make - from your opponents unplayed tokens.  That&rsquo;s also the super simple way you keep score! Again super satisfying and adding another layer of risk management, separation anxiety and competitive dynamics. &ndash; Genius!&#10;2.    Expand the game board size&#10;   &bull;    Modular board games allow the board to get wider and that finally allows the strategic development to expand.  The result - a massive increase in player engagement and satisfaction.&#10;3.    Introduce a diversity of token characters with new properties to meaningfully contribute to the gameplay and diversify game options further.  A satisfying upgrade for seasoned strategists.&#10;4.    Open up interactive co-op team play&#10;   &bull;    The modular boards are a total natural fit for others to join and play interactive cooperative team games.  The result is a further cascade in dynamics as the human element is introduced.  It&rsquo;s easily one of the most fun ways to play. It&rsquo;s also one of the most accessible co-op styled board-games in the world! A true contender that may finally bring cooperative styled boardgaming into the mainstream!&#10;Flexibility: The options above can be toggled on or off in different game options to allow players to grow into the new gameplay levels.  Combining all of the above entirely unleashes the true potential of the strategic alignment genre.  Once you play the new games it feels strange indeed that it&rsquo;s taken 5 decades to finally make this most obvious transition.&#10;&#10;The Revolutionary New Hardware:&#10;   &bull;    Smart Tokens: Now your tokens finally sort themselves and shoot straight back at you at the press of a button.  That gives you more game time and turns the tedious task of manually sorting tokens into a magic treat for everyone, every game!&#10;   &bull;    Modular Gameboards: Players can now join up to 3 boards together to make a bigger fully integrated board.  The result is a massive boost to gameplay diversity and depth.&#10;   &bull;    Iconic 3D tokens:  We&rsquo;ve turned design thinking inside out when we developed the TorKings tokens.  They are a mixture of sculpted 3D forms and voids beautifully framed by the surrounding torus.  They are a breakthrough in visual accessibility that allows token diversity to explode along with gameplay depth.  They are also very tactile and visually stunning in the game grid.&#10;   &bull;    Snap Latch : We&rsquo;ve put an end to the violation of your tokens randomly releasing in the middle of your game.  The snap latch snaps shut and secures your game.&#10;   &bull;    Spinners:  The tokens can spin in a variety of ways.  They are handy as timers, selectors and impressively cool play things in their own right.&#10;   &bull;    Safety:  The tokens re designed to allow airflow regardless of orientation in an airway. That allows parents to breathe a little easier when younger kids inadvertently wander into the mix.&#10;   &bull;    Premium Quality: We&rsquo;ve designed the game to be a very different premium journey for players of all ages. It&rsquo;s a completely new level of enjoyment and fun.&#10;&#10;Description from the designer - James T.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Driven by an all-consuming hatred of living things, these spectral horrors sweep across the realms in great hosts, killing everything in their path. They remember only dim echoes of their past, fragments of the person they were, and half-faded memories of the events that led to their current predicament. This is enough to keep them in a state of perpetual torment, which pleases cruel Nagash. On occasion the Great Necromancer will assemble smaller groups of Nighthaunts in order to achieve a particularly delicate task. Their incorporeal nature and resistance to most physical damage makes the gheists particularly suited to such missions.&#10;&#10;Want to play Warcry with a Nighthaunt warband? This is the perfect place to start! This specially-designed warband set contains a variety of Nighthaunt fighters, giving you a versatile and diverse warband out of the box. Fighter cards for every kind of Nighthaunt warrior make expanding your warband simple, while the Abilities card lets you master the sinister powers of the Nighthaunt.&#10;&#10;This set contains 13 Citadel Miniatures, including 4 Myrnmourn Banshees, 4 Glaivewraith Stalkers and 5 Grimghast Reapers (with the option to build one as an Extoller of Shyish). It also includes an ability card that provides reference imagery for your fighters and powers they can use on the battlefield, fighter cards for 7 different types of fighter, including the Dreadwarden, Grimghast Reaper, Chainrasp, Spirit Host, Glaivewraith Stalker, Extoller of Shyish and the Myrmourn Banshee. Finally, you'll get 2 double-sided, Nighthaunt-themed token boards, letting you track activations, initiative, treasure, objectives and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Dividing his forces into two columns, Harrison ordered General Winchester to join up with a smaller force of Michigan volunteers at Frenchtown, south of Detroit along the River Raisin while he led another column that would follow later after they assembled from scattered winter quarters. The volunteers and a small detachment that escaped from Detroit at Frenchtown beat back an earlier attack by Canadian militia and their First Nation American allies. Learning of the larger US force coming from the south, British General Proctor left Detroit in the midst of the winter weather to deal with the growing US threat at the River Raisin. One of the most dramatic engagements of the war was about to ensue.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well, or better? Learn and enjoy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Moreover a second Dragon joins the game on a new &quot;Builders&quot; board that accepts double of the number of Building tiles. So you&rsquo;ll need to double the number of Knights and Towers and much more money!&#10;&#10;Since this expansion doesn&rsquo;t officially exist, you&rsquo;ll have to make it, using the files below with the needed elements in a printable version.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;If you already played Queendomino, you&rsquo;ll love this expansion !&#10;&#10;----- (I have translated the rules from french but not sure my english is good enough ! Help needed for better translation !!) -----&#10;&#10;Il s'agit d'une extension pour le jeu Queendomino. Elle est largement compatible avec l'extension &quot;La Cour&quot;.&#10;&#10;L'objectif du jeu reste le m&ecirc;me, faire un royaume qui permette de marquer un maximum de points !&#10;&#10;Elle est un peu ce qu'est &quot;Age of Giants&quot; pour Kingdomino : elle ajoute un joueur, des interactions et du fun, mais surtout des points en fin de partie !&#10;&#10;L'ajout d'un joueur (sa couleur sera le noir) se fait par l'ajout de dominos (essentiellement des tuiles de ville et donc de B&acirc;timents).&#10;&#10;L'ajout d'interaction et de fun se fait par l'apparition d'une nouvelle gamme de tuiles : les tuiles &quot;Ev&eacute;nement Fantastique&quot; qui impactent chaque tour de jeu, soit de mani&egrave;re positive, soit de mani&egrave;re n&eacute;gative. De plus un second Dragon rejoint la partie sur un nouveau plateau des B&acirc;tisseurs doubl&eacute; en nombre de tuiles. Il faut donc le double de Chevaliers, le double de Tours et beaucoup plus d'argent !&#10;&#10;Comme cette extension n'existe pas officiellement, il vous faudra la fabriquer &agrave; partir des fichiers joints afin d'imprimer l'ensemble des &eacute;l&eacute;ments n&eacute;cessaires.&#10;&#10;Si vous avez d&eacute;j&agrave; jou&eacute; &agrave; Queendomino, vous allez aimer cette extension !&#10;&#10;",

Then, players resolve each of the 3 Battle Fields, scoring them and gaining their unique win rewards.

Players may discard any card from their hand to put a card from the Market in their Preparation Area (to draw next round).&#10;     Recruit Action. Players may discard 2 cards from their hand to play a card from the Study into their Active Card Slot of their Plan.

Players may (if they still have cards in hand) spend Musou to activate their Legend's unique Musou Ability.&#10;&#10;&#10;What makes Dawn of Legends unique is the Plan (Player Board) players play cards to. As Cards are played to it or exit it, they have varying effects. Some cards may have effects while they remain in your Plan, while others may protect your Plan or affect your opponents Plan.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

(It is therefore equivalent to a board of octagons and squares.)&#10;&#10;Each player has two types of pieces: blocks (large discs) and pawns (small pointed cylinders). A large square can hold one block or up to four pawns (possibly from both players); a small square can only only a pawn.&#10;&#10;On a turn both players roll two dice and the high roller gets to move; they can move two pieces, one with each die, or one piece using the sum of the dice. If they exceed the opponent's roll by at least four they must move blocks, otherwise they must move pawns.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to either surround the center square with your pieces or capture all opposing pieces. Capturing is generally done by occupying the large squares adjacent to opposing pieces with your own (there are seven different cases covered in the rules).&#10;&#10;The game board is made of rolled-up vinyl, packaged with the pieces and rules in a large tube.&#10;&#10;",

Break the Bank is a slot machine deck builder for 1-4 players where players are trying to earn money and victory points, and use their earnings to optimize their decks and attempt to hit the legendary Jackpot! - Breaking the bank!&#10;&#10;The game is played simultaneously. Each round players get to draw two cards to their hand, and then 'pull the lever' and draw the top three cards in your slot machine deck into your three slots. Players now get to play a card from their hand into the slot machine to change the outcome.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to hit payouts. Payouts occur when a player has three symbols of the same kind: ie. ???. When hitting a payout, the player is awarded a &#226;&#173;&#144;&#10;&#10;Players will be optimizing their decks by sending cards to their opponents as well as purchasing cards that will yield bigger winnings.&#10;&#10;The end game condition is triggered when any player &quot;breaks the bank&quot; which is a term used by the casinos when a player is winning more money than is currently available.&#10;&#10;One cool feature in this game is that you never shuffle your deck. Once your slot machine deck is depleted - you simply stack your three slots into a new deck. This means that when playing cards from your hand, you will organize your deck and increase your chances of hitting payouts.&#10;&#10;Players will also have 4 personal objectives that can be completed in a specific order. These are for instance to hit a payout using cherries. The next objective could be to win with melons. The final objective is always to hit the Jackpot ?&#10;&#10;When there is no more money in the bank. The game ends - and the players count all &#226;&#173;&#144; they have on their cards. &#226;&#173;&#144; they got from completing their objectives, as well as any &#226;&#173;&#144;-tokens they got for hitting a payout.&#10;&#10;The player who has the most &#226;&#173;&#144; wins Jackpot!

They are the energy vortices on the etheric body which envelops the physical body. When understood, mastered and balanced, chakras invoke certain abilities that allow us to become adept in the respective fields. This game deals with 6 chakras and their associated properties. The knowledge of these properties is a step towards obtaining the key to different realms.&#10;&#10;Objective:&#10;Aim of the game is to collect and make sets of cards associated with properties of chakras, thus symbolically attaining the knowledge with properties of all chakras to become CONSCIOUS of oneself!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Chakra property cards are dealt to players who then attempt to make sets of cards. Basic and advanced versions define the nature of these sets. The game is played across multiple rounds, where each round focuses on claiming one chakra and use the associated ability (unique for each Chakra) in the subsequent round. The player to claim all the Chakras wins the game. Variants have also been suggested to alter gameplay length and/or complexity.&#10;&#10;The subject of the game is suitable for all ages, making this a family-friendly game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But each Gallic confederation has its own agenda and must keep its eyes not only on the Romans but also on Celtic, Belgic, and Germanic rivals.

To play you need six six-sided dice, each not exceeding 0.5 inches, about eight pawns, and a dozen counters or tokens. If you do not have any pawns nor counters.&#10;The game is divided into three different parts, each corresponding to three pages, which you will use as game boards. Print each one on a different sheet of cardboard and follow their instructions.&#10;&#10;Part I: Recruiting Adventurers&#10;The first step to penetrate Taumant's lair is to form a party capable of surviving its many hazards. Luckily, you are near to the city-state of Kalazar, located between two kingdoms at war. It makes Kalazar the perfect place to look for adventurers. You must explore the city and try to recruit people prepared to risk their lives.&#10;&#10;Part II: The Dungeon&#10;It's the time! Your party is about to get into the cavern. Your goal is to get through its six levels with as few losses as possible. You will play six turns, each corresponding one level of the cave. Put the pawns representing your adventurers on the appropriate square of the column 'ready' and another one on the first level of the dungeon. If you beat the sixth level, you will face Taumant in Part III with your surviving adventurers!&#10;&#10;Part III: Taumant!&#10;You have arrived at Taumant's chamber. This will be a tough fight! As soon as he meets the adventurers, he prepares himself to reduce his enemies to ashes with his deadly fire breath. You have only three turns before he buries your party in a hell of flames. Every unwounded adventurer has a roll for every turn. Put this sheet 12 inches from you and roll a die towards the dragon; if it stops on him, you will cause damage points depending on its location. If you cause 50 or more damage points, you win! Otherwise, you can return to Part I and try again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As you explore the three Islands, you will develop a map to help you along the way. You will also need to collect or buy wood to build a raft so you can cross to the next island. Two of the Islands have Tribal Chiefs that are hidden and you must find. These Chiefs will each give you half of the secret location of the temple.&#10;&#10;The Chief will either greet you with hostility or friendship depending on how you treat his people. As you explore you will come across different types of villages that you can trade with or overtake if necessary. Some will be hostile and automatically attack you while others will be friendly. Keep track of your food because if you run out your crew will start to die from starvation. Try to obtain medicine in case your crew get sick from the natives. Once you've spoke with both Chiefs you will have the secret location and can travel to the last island. Search the island and find the Temple to set your name in history and your King the richest in the nation.

As you press the activate button, the other you says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t screw it up like I did.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The Second Most Perfect Moment is a standalone (and combinable) expansion to The Perfect Moment. It's made up of 3 small expansions that were released in 2019.&#10;&#10;Players race to rewrite history in their favor using a deck of only 18 cards. Players use equipment, exploit paradoxes in the time-space continuum, and author their own revision of the past. Featuring a clever multi-sided card system, every card is used by both players based on what they can see. Equipping that card for yourself may just give your opponent the ability they were looking for. Every turn, players activate up to two revealed cards, which each have special effects. After the effects are resolved, the player can optionally score a card to earn up to 3 points depending on how closely they match it. The first player to 16 points wins. It takes careful planning and a bit of luck to avoid failing like you have so many times before. This time will be different.&#10;&#10;This time...&#10;&#10;&#10;This can be played on its own or combined with The Perfect Moment and expansions.&#10;&#10;Includes 3 previously released expansion sets of the series, and the solo mode rule set:&#10;&#10;     1979: A Job Interview Gone Wrong&#10;     1987: A Little Espionage Gone Wrong&#10;     2010: An Escape Plan Gone Wrong&#10;     The Perfect Moment: Echoes (2nd version)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The common components are dice, counters in five colors, and a 10x10 board with numbered spaces; the numbers also have various colors.&#10;&#10;Some of the later games are suitable for play by adults. In one, players roll four dice and then must use arithmetic operations to produce a number on the board, which they place a counter on. When certain dice combinations are rolled the player with the top counter on a space may move the stack. The object is generally to reach the edge of the board, but (as with all the games in the set) there are many variants and optional rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Counteract is played on a 6x6 board with the squares numbered from 1-6; one space of each number is a &quot;magic square&quot; with a star on it. Each player has a supply of counters.&#10;&#10;On a typical turn a player rolls a die and places a counter on an empty space with the matching number. They may take another turn if a 6 is rolled. Each player may make a &quot;power play&quot; three times during the game; this involves rolling two dice and allows replacing an opposing piece at the designated coordinates if there is one.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player uses all their pieces. Scoring is primarily based on forming lines of six pieces and on occupying the magic squares, although there are some extra points available to the player who goes out.&#10;&#10;",
