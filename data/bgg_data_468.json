Led by one of Rome&rsquo;s favorite son&rsquo;s, German born Arminius, turned on those that loved and trained him, leading four German tribes (18000 men) into deadly battle with Varus&rsquo; Roman Army. The German ambush at the Kalkriese Narrows ( a narrow strip of land only 220m wide) caught the Romans by complete surprise with an am-bush. One the 2nd day, all 20000 Romans had been killed. This game focuses on the second day as the Romans approached the narrows and the German attack !&#10;&#10;The map scale is about 550 yards per hex. Each combat unit is a cohort of 500 men for the Roman and between 500-1000 men for the German. A game turn represents one hour of time.&#10;&#10;The design is unique and captures the flavor of battle during this period. The game depends upon the German player and when he launches his devastating attack. In fact, until the German attacks, the Romans simply casually march towards their destination. When the attacks begin, blood will spill across the map as the Romans try desperately try to maintain damage control. But this is hard, as the German tribes create an attack like a shark frenzy, which only continues to become more barbaric!&#10;&#10;The battle sequence contains three rounds of types of combat, leaders and morale are vital and is impacted by what happens in the combat rounds.&#10;&#10;One 11x17 Map, rules, 280 counters. Still only $16.00. Designed by Kerala Cironi. Developed by Perry Moore.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Royal Battles is a strategic board game of small scale battles played with playing cards and chess pieces. In Royal Battles players compete to defeat each other in head-to-head combat. Each player builds an army of 4 units (represented with chess pieces) and maneuvers them on a battle board made from a tile grid of playing cards. Each unit has a special ability that sets it apart and it is the combination of units and abilities that will determine the difference between victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;Requires playing cards (standard poker or bridge decks) and chess pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Long ago on a small island lived a tribe with a problem.  For as long as they could remember each member of the tribe had been infected with the dreaded toe-sap fungus.  With every step taken, a small droplet of toe-sap would ooze from each toe.  This, of course, was a constant source of shame to the tribe members.&#10;&#10;Then one day a young man named Johnny discovered two important facts that would change the island forever -- the toe-sap was actually quite delicious and each tribe member produced a different flavor.  Johnny was hailed as a hero and soon toe-sap became the island's number one export.&#10;&#10;Tribe members spent long days gathering toe-sap, however it soon became apparent that the tribal leaders could influence the toe-sap market, making some varieties more valuable.&#10;&#10;As members of the tribe, players take turns collecting varieties of toe-sap.  They can also offer cows to the tiny sea-going Cownivores in order to collect toe-sap more quickly.  At the end of the game, the players influence the tribal leaders using shells and their remaining cows to dictate the price of each variety of toe-sap.&#10;&#10;",

The main theme, not surprising given the sponsorship, is photographing wildlife.&#10;&#10;As usual with these sorts of games, various points along the path cause things to happen, mostly drawing a card of some sort.  You win by getting a photograph of a quokka and getting to the end of the path.  There are a group of six quokka photo squares, such that you can't possibly miss it on the way through.&#10;&#10;The main educational content of the game is a small brochure with (tourist) information about the island.&#10;&#10;",

It is essentially the same as the standard Monopoly game and other variations, but in Turkish with the properties all being places in Istanbul.  In the current version, two of the railroads are replaced with ferry terminals.  The chance and community chest cards are apparently based on the British version and thus lack pictures aside from an arrow for advancing to Go and bars for going to jail.  They also differ slightly from the modern American cards and are closer to the older American version.&#10;&#10;",

The game system will be using our Forged in Fire rules with adjustments for the situation facing both Union and Confederate commanders in the Shenandoah Valley. Supply and surprise will be critical as Jackson races up and down the Valley fighting one Union force after another as the Union try to trap the Confederates. The game will include a main campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. Playable in 3-4 hours for the full campaign with 1-2 hours for scenarios. Victory is determined by how many Union troops the Confederate player can force the Union player to keep in the Valley. The Union player will try to keep the bare minimum of troops in the Valley to prevent the Confederate player from obtaining certain objectives.&#10;&#10;According to Worthington's June 1, 2011 update this game will be the first in a series including games on the Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Overland, and Atlanta campaigns as well as an update of Forged in Fire: The 1862 Peninsula Campaign.&#10;&#10;",

Just read, count, and roll dice.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A game of chance by rolling the dice. Each player will encircle board several times in one game. Player keeps moving his token around the board the number of spaces indicated by the total sum of the two dice. Each space landed upon and each card drawn directs the movements of teh player. No one is safe even in his own play area. He must follow directions of space landings. There is no blocking, no bumping players off spaces and no back obligations. First player to fill his staff with notes and complete a song title is the winner.

The cities on the map have numbers that correspond to the numbers on the destination cards, so that small children will have no difficulty in identifying the position of the cities on the map.&#10;&#10;",

The player in the field calls a pitch (fastball, curve, slow ball, drop, or knuckle ball).  The result of the pitch is read from the top card.  Pitch results include strike, ball, foul ball, hit batsman, wild pitch, balk or &quot;field play.&quot;&#10;&#10;When &quot;field play&quot; is the result of the pitch, the card is turned over to the Field Play side to determine the play outcome. Different play outcomes are included on each card, and the specific outcome used is based upon the number of outs and the number and location of baserunners.&#10;&#10;After the result for a particular pitch has been determined, that card is discarded and play continues with the next card in the deck.&#10;&#10;Although the game concept is simple, it works quite well, and play can be very competitive.  However, the strategic aspects of baseball are ignored.  There is no bunting, hit and run, positioning of the defense, etc.&#10;&#10;This game has one notable oddity.  The game board is a depiction of a baseball field with defenders drawn at the normal defensive positions.  The defenders are numbered based upon standard baseball scoring conventions, except that the corner outfielders are reversed--that is, the rightfielder is shown as &quot;7&quot; and the leftfielder as &quot;9.&quot;&#10;&#10;This game was produced and marketed for at least 10 years under a variety of names: &quot;Baseball&quot;, &quot;Baseball Game for Young America&quot;, and &quot;Little League Baseball&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

You can follow the track around the 3 rungs with the Clowns and the Ringmaster. You can build the various circus acts - the animal acts, the trapeze acts, the tumblers, the jugglers and others. There's a prize for each act you complete and whoever gets the most prizes, wins. Let's play!&quot;&#10;&#10;This game uses a simplistic card drawing and set collection method to move players around the board. Movement around the board seems to serve no purpose other than to kill time, as all the game mechanic is from drawing cards and placing cards on the game board to make sets. Points are accumulated when sets are completed, or when indicated by the type of card drawn at the beginning of the player's turn.&#10;&#10;OBJECT&#10;The object of the game is to win the most Emmett Kelly Prize Disks. A Prize is won when a player &#10;&#10;         Plays a Circus Act Card that completes and Act.&#10;         Draws an Emmett Kelly Prize Card&#10;         Stops on an Emmett Kelly space in the game board track.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Place the Emmett Kelly Prize Disks in a pile to one side.&#10;&#10;Mix up the action cards and place them face down in a pile near the game board&#10;&#10;All players select a colored Playing Piece and place it on the matching Ringmaster space on the board. the player that chose Green goes first and then play proceeds to the left&#10;&#10;Each turn starts by drawing an Action Card from the face down pile.&#10;&#10;ACTION CARDS - WHAT THEY MEAN&#10;Circus Act Cards. Each Circus Act card has a picture matching a part of an Act in the Circus, menagerie or Side Show. When Drawn, the player looks on the board for part of an Act it matches and places the card on it. The player also moves the playing piece the number of spaces shown on the card. moves are always in a clockwise direction.&#10;Whenever a player draws and plays an Act Card that completes an Act, he takes one Emmett Kelly Prize Disk.&#10;&#10;Emmett Kelly Cards. When drawn, the player moves ahead to the next Emmett Kelly space on the game board track and takes one Emmett Kelly Prize Disk.&#10;&#10;Blue Clown Cards. When drawn, the player moves his playing piece the number of spaces shown on the card.&#10;&#10;Red Clown Cards. When drawn, the player moves his playing piece the number of spaces shown in the card. Also if any player (whether the one drawing the Red Clown Card or not) has more Prizes than the others, that player returns one Prize to the Prize pile. If two or more players are tied for most Prizes, none is given up.&#10;&#10;Ringmaster Cards. When drawn, the player moves to the next Ringmaster space and takes another turn.&#10;&#10;Clown Dog Card. When drawn, the player moves to the next Clown Dog space and loses his next turn.&#10;&#10;The Circus Act Cards are played on the board. All the other Action Cards are piled face up to one side after they are drawn and used.&#10;&#10;WINNING&#10;When all the Acts on the game board have been completed, by covering them with matching cards, the player with the most Emmett Kelly Prizes is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Listed in American Games, #4186.  1946, Sports, Football, Board game.&#10;&#10;This two-player football game featured a folding game board (football field), 36 play cards, a metal football, a first down marker, and wooden markers to track the down, quarter, and score.&#10;&#10;Play begins with the play cards shuffled and placed face down on the board.  The player on offense calls a play from a limited menu (long pass, short pass, end run, line buck, punt, field goal), and the top card is then turned over to determine the result of the play.&#10;&#10;There is a good variety of play outcomes, including fumbles, intercepted passes, and penalties.  However, the game was designed in an era when single wing formations dominated, passing was relatively rare, and offenses were often &quot;three yards and a cloud of dust.&quot;  As a result, long advances from scrimmage are rare.  The longest possible gain is 41 yards on a long pass.&#10;&#10;Defense does not come into play, and the player on defense simply must hope that the player on offense fails to achieve successful play outcomes.&#10;&#10;One pass through the card deck constitutes a quarter of football.&#10;&#10;This game might have nostalgic value for those who played it as youngsters, but there are far better football games available today.&#10;&#10;",

The cattle are affixed to colored bases that match one player's corral. Each player has corresponding pieces: 1 bull (worth 10 points), 3 cows (worth 5 points) and 1 maverick calf (worth 2 points).&#10;&#10;The players take turns using a lasso made of a length of string to lasso one of their cattle. A player gets three tries to successfully capture one of the cattle before their turn ends. Once a piece is successfully lassoed by the player, the player must drag  the piece using the lasso to the appropriate place on the board.&#10;&#10;Bulls and cows must be pulled through the gate into the player's corral. Once in the corral, the pieces are scored and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Maverick calves are first taken to the Branding Pen and left for a turn, before it can be lassoed again and taken to the corral.&#10;&#10;The board has obstacles (like cacti) which must be avoided while dragging the cattle, or the player's turn ends. If a player's lassoed cattle tips over while dragging, the turn ends.&#10;&#10;The player may &quot;rustle&quot; another player's cattle. If a player has already captured one type of cattle, the player may try to rustle another player's cattle of the same type. If the cattle tips over while dragging the piece to the corral, the rustler must return the tipped piece and an extra of the same type of piece from their own corral which they had previously successfully lassoed.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Listed in American Games, #4193.  1946, Western, Board game.&#10;&#10;",

Kennedy left the scene of the accident and was later given a suspended sentence of 2 months in jail.&#10;&#10;Senator Kennedy (in reference to this incident) has sometimes been referred to as a 'Chap Acquitted'.&#10;&#10;This 'game' appears to challenge the acquittal and cast an unfavorable shadow on Ted Kennedy.  The box cover refers to it as a 'Bridge game of sorts' and included a 273 page book entitled - Teddy Bare, the real story of Chappaquiddick.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a travel letter/word game that was given to members of the American Airlines Sky Club in 1971 as a form of advertising. It appears this was designed to be played to pass the time during long flights. Each packet contains a blue slider sheet with 10 square holes with corresponding top/bottom slits, plus 1 cardboard strip listing 24 categories, and 10 strips each containing all the letters of the alphabet (A-Z). The strips are designed to slide through the top &amp; bottom slits, so that only 1 letter (or category) is visible through the square hole.&#10;&#10;The first player holds the slider sheet horizontally and selects a category. They slide the category strip vertically into the slider sheet until the chosen category is visible. Then, they mentally choose a word for the other players to guess. They slide 2 letter strips vertically into the slider, so that only the first and last letters are visible. The other players in clockwise order call out letters they believe will fit this word. Letters called that do NOT appear in the word score 1 point against the caller. Correct letters are positioned in the proper slots. When any player guesses the original word correctly, he wins 1 point and becomes the next word/category selector. The game ends when 1 player wins 10 points.&#10;&#10;Listed in American Games, #4213.  1971, Travel, Advertising, Ad game for Airline, Board game.&#10;&#10;",

There is a single counter representing Sherlock Holmes and the players take turns moving it about the board.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the board and with a deck of cards. Each cards has a picture of one of the suspects on it and there are two cards for each suspect. At the start of the game one player shuffles the cards and places one face down in the middle of the board. The remaining cards are then dealt out to the players.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player lands on a picture of a suspect they must show any cards of that suspect. If they land on an &quot;investigate&quot; space they can examine a card from another player's hand. And, if they land on the &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; space then all players holding pairs of cards (two cards of the same suspect) must show them. Other spaces have special events on them which cause players to exchange hands and the like.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player thinks they know who the culprit is. They announce their choice and check the card in the middle of the board. If they are correct they are the winner. Otherwise they are out of the game and play continues until someone makes the correct guess.&#10;&#10;Sherlock Holmes is a variant of the game Clue . The object is to figure out which card is in the middle of the board. Since there will be two cards for every suspect in the player's hands except for this one the idea is to figure out which card doesn't have a match in another hand.&#10;&#10;This game was authorized by the Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle estate.&#10;&#10;",
