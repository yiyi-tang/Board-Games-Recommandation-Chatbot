    "Description": "The vault at Centennial City Bank is currently rumored to be holding a record amount of cash, precious diamonds, ancient artifacts, and highly-sensitive digital information. As the boss of one of the city's most notorious crime organizations, robbing that vault for all it's worth is constantly on your mind. There's only one problem&mdash;this job is too big for just your crew alone. You're going to need help from some of your biggest rival crime bosses if you want to succeed. You'll need to join forces on a series of smaller jobs in order to acquire the skills and resources you'll need to pull off the biggest heist the city has ever seen&mdash;but watch your back! Once you and your new partners in crime are inside the bank vault, it'll be every boss for himself. If you manage to safely escape the scene with more loot than your rivals, you'll be revered as the city's most notorious crime boss. Hire your crew, plan the heist, and get ready for the big score!&#10;&#10;The Big Score is a competitive game for 1-6 players that plays in 30-60 minutes. The game is structured into two distinct halves.&#10;&#10;In the first half of the game, players use card drafting to carefully choose which specialists to add to their crew. They secretly decide how to assign them to various small heists throughout the city, and they need to pick just the right moment to send in their most skilled expert to ensure a job's success! If these plans go well, players steal a variety of loot: cold hard cash, diamonds that escalate in value as more are gained, artifacts that are profitable for the player with the largest collection, and hard drives full of information that become lucrative only if hacked with a digital key.&#10;&#10;In the second half of the game, individual player abilities come into play as the players attempt the mother of all heists&mdash;the big score. Players risk being busted by the cops as they steal even more loot in an exciting, press-your-luck grand finale inside the vault at Centennial City Bank!&#10;&#10;The Big Score also features a challenging solo-play mode designed by A.J. Porfirio (Hostage Negotiator).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "4049: The galaxy hums with prosperity and peace two millennia after the dawn of space travel. But as mankind and its neighbors colonized the stars, the burgeoning need for resources was apparent. One by one, new geological discoveries revolutionized terraform, construction and energy technology. The sub-temperature properties of the mineral Ice-9 allowed life-giving water to flow on uninhabitable planets. Crystallized Cobalt was accidentally found to be incredibly strong, resistant to extreme pressure. And a single chunk of Deuterium could power a sprawling metropolis for a month!&#10;&#10;As a plucky entrepreneur you must explore the edges of space searching for precious minerals. Will you buy the fastest ship in the sector or hire the best pilot in the galaxy? Purchase the latest state-of-the-art gadgets, invest in planetary refineries, or pay off your rising debt? The cargo you haul could be worth fortune, so grab your helmet and suit up! The cosmos and a mountain of credits call!&#10;&#10;In Starship Merchants, each player runs a fledgling corporation looking to stake a claim in the lucrative mining business. Player will buy starships, explore the galaxy and deliver cargo for interstellar credits, all the while expanding their operations.&#10;&#10;Starting at the shipyard and ending at the dock, players will move clockwise around the four quadrants on the board to complete an entire Business Cycle. During each turn, a player either performs one action at the current quadrant or advances to the next, performing an action there. As players take actions or advance they spread apart across all four quadrants while completing individual Business Cycles.&#10;&#10;The Shipyard is where you can buy a speedy scout or a heavy load bearing tug. The Market is where Gear, Pilots, Refineries, and claims can be purchased. In the belt, starships are run by spending energy points to explore, pickup mines, or fly to another destination. The final quadrant is the Dock where delivered cargo is traded for credits.&#10;&#10;A player that ends his turn at the Dock with 100+ credits can declare the Final Run, ending the game. But after completing the Final Run, the player with the most credits wins!&#10;&#10;",

Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sequels:&#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&#10;    Munchkin Bites!&#10;    Munchkin Booty&#10;    Munchkin Conan&#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&#10;    Munchkin Fu&#10;    Munchkin Impossible&#10;    Munchkin Legends&#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&#10;    Munchkin Zombies&#10;    Star Munchkin&#10;    Super Munchkin&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Related Board Games&#10;    Munchkin Quest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online play&#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

Players are assigned a horse and must move it around the track by rolling a single die.  This would be rather boring if the game didn't allow for the players to bet on another player's horse, so the dilemma is whether or not to move your horse badly just to make it easier for the horse you bet on to win.  Even that could be boring, but then each player is issued cards that allow them to commit dirty tricks, for instance making a horse fall or forcing the winner to take a drug test.

Surf's up!&#10;&#10;In Longboard, players draft and trade surfboard pieces as they attempt to build the tallest and most surfboards. More specifically, on a turn you take two actions, with three types of actions being possible:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Add a card from the deck to your personal supply, that is, cards lying face up in front of you.&#10;    Take a card from your supply to start or lengthen a board; all cards in a board have to be the same color (or wild) and each new card on a board must be equal to or greater in value than the card below it.&#10;    Place one or more cards in your supply in an opponent's supply, then take a single card from their supply of value less than the sum of what you gave them and use this card to start or lengthen a board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each board card features 1-3 stickers, which count as points when the surfboard is complete, that is, when it contains at least four cards. When a player has 3-4 complete boards, at least one of which contains 7+ cards, they can choose to end the game. If that doesn't happen before the deck runs out, the game ends at that point. Players then score sticker points on completed boards, lose points for incomplete boards, and score bonus points if they have the longest completed board or the most completed boards or if they have completed any of the four random objective cards put into play at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Whist is a trick taking standard deck playing card game that was played widely in the 18th and 19th centuries and is often mentioned in literature from that time period.&#10;&#10;The most basic version of the game features fixed partnerships with no bidding. The game uses a single deck, and follows the basic mechanics of most trick taking games: the starting player leads a suit, and then the other players are forced to follow unless they have none of that suit left, in which case they are allowed to either toss a useless card of another suit, or to play a trump.&#10;&#10;The object of Whist is to acquire tricks in excess of 6, each 1 of which scores 1 point. In this basic form the game usually goes to 5, though 7 and 9 point variations were also common. The trumps in standard Whist were determined by facing the last card to be dealt.&#10;&#10;In addition, like most card games, there are a large variety of variants. A common one involves pre-determing the trump suit, and running them in order from hand to hand. (For instance: Hearts first, then Diamonds, Spades, and finally Clubs, and then start over again)&#10;&#10;Another, less popular and luck oriented variant involves giving a 4 point bonus to a partnership if it held the 'Honours' run of A - K - Q - J in the suit that was trump for that hand or 2 points if it had 3 of the 4. As this is based on the cards as dealt it is a very luck based option, and as such has fallen out of common use though it was once considered a standard way to play the game.&#10;&#10;Other variants include bidding (quite common, and turn the game into something closely resembling Spades) and two player adaptations.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Earth is in mortal danger!&#10;&#10;Invaders is a card-driven board game of warfare and horror featuring asymmetrical game-play for two players. In the game, the players take on the roles of commanding forces on opposite sides of the conflict.&#10;&#10;One player leads the extraterrestrial conquerors whose goal is to transform the Earth and subjugate its inhabitants. The Invaders possess unthinkable weapons and unknowable technologies. More so, within their galactic armada the aliens hold bound a terrifying array of eldritch creatures engineered specifically to sow the chaos and destruction that heralds the arrival of their masters.&#10;&#10;The other player commands the unyielding forces of a united Earth. In the shadow of a planet-wide scourge, the nations of the Earth have joined forces to confront the arrival of a doom spawned on the other side of the galaxy. The Terran alliance is a desperation-forged bulwark upon which the invading forces crash and are repelled time and again. Outgunned, with salvaged or untested technology and one foot in the grave, the determined network of military machinery, elite strike-teams, warfare scientists, and neighborhood militias are surprisingly capable of bloodying the Invaders' noses whenever the two forces meet.&#10;&#10;The eponymous Invaders seek to destroy the forces defending the Earth and exhaust their reserves. They do this by defeating the defending forces at key locations while also causing the Earth player to disrupt cards from their deck to their discard pile. The Invader must be cunning when deploying their creatures and war-machines, or enacting their schemes, as the cost to bring assets into the war often involves the discarding of other assets.&#10;&#10;Mankind must work desperately to defend critical resources and locations from the corruption and incursion of the alien threat. They do this by building formidable and deadly defenses, predicting where the alien player will strike and setting traps designed to deprive the Invaders of key units and wear-down their options. Like the Invader, the humans need to be clever in what they deploy and how they deploy it because their heroes may be bold but they are small in number, and the Invaders are inexorable.&#10;&#10;Invaders is a science-fiction game piled thick with the trappings of war and horror. It is steeped in difficult decisions, but built upon a simple, elegant set of rules, and because of this, you will find each game telling a slightly different story each time you play. Both sides use cards to represent their units, plans, resources and events, but as this is an asymmetrical battle game, the way in which those cards are played and how they forward their owner's goals are very different. Regardless, knowing when to let an asset go in favor of a better one, how to exploit a weakness in your enemy's ranks, and where to press an advantage or feint a trap will be key in seeing your side emerge as the victor from the morass of galactic war.&#10;&#10;One question remains: Which side are YOU on?&#10;&#10;",

Succeed in a variety of missions on randomly generated worlds with unique ecosystems, without luxuries like radios, landing gear, and medical supplies. Trust in your partner is paramount since, without radios, you can&rsquo;t communicate (in real life) after separating on the game board.&#10;&#10;Survive, and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with a meager paycheck. Succumb to the planet, and you&rsquo;ll find help is too far away.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Far Away ProgramThe Federation Alliance started the Far Away program nearly 50 cycles ago to discover and explore new worlds.

That&rsquo;s where you, the willing explorer, can help!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Explorer DutiesThe Federation has several active missions for you to choose. Each offers unique challenges and potential sub-objectives we would love for you to accomplish off-the-clock. Thanks to the randomly generated universe, every mission attempt will be different.&#10;&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve selected a mission and crashed into the planet (landing gear has been deemed &ldquo;optional&rdquo;), you must begin surviving. Your goal is to complete the mission and rebuild your ship. You will fail if you die of hunger, loneliness, or multiple grievous injuries. Don&rsquo;t fail!&#10;&#10;Be forewarned: communication will be a challenge. Radios will not be provided, so the only way to communicate with your partner is to be in close physical proximity. Plan ahead! This not only allows you to strategize, but also prevents the psychological meltdown that comes with being alone on an alien world.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Alien CreaturesEach planet has a unique ecosystem. Experts have identified upwards of 32 creatures in the known universe, each with their own behavioral patterns.&#10;&#10;Explorers will be tasked to Realistically and Objectively Log Events Performed Logically by Animals and Yourself (ROLEPLAY). Creature behavior is dictated by their diet, temperament, and other factors. Explorers are provided a quick guide to educate them on default creature movement, but we encourage explorers to embrace their inner-alien and log the creature actions with creativity and vibrant storytelling.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Far Away Recruitment KitYour exploration kit can be delivered straight to your home.

When you use a card and token, you mark your Garden and Play sheets, trying to get different combinations of fruits and vegetables.&#10;&#10;The cards in the middle are common, but players place them in different containers within their garden setting up different combinations and scoring opportunities. Bonus tools and special powers mean that no two gardens are ever alike.&#10;&#10;After 12 rounds, the player with the highest score wins. &#10;- If there is a tie, the player whose fruit planter score is higher wins.&#10;- If there is still a tie, the player who has marked the most First Potter Bonus icons wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "[English]&#10;&#10;Europe, 1702. The death of king Charles II of Habsburg left the throne vacant and started a war all over Europe to settle the matter of the Spanish Succession. The Archduke Charles III of Austria, the Habsburg heir, was discarded by the last will of Charles II, signed almost on his deathbed, in favor of Phillip of Anjou, Louis XIV&rsquo;s grandson, the Bourbon heir. The Grand Alliance has been formed, by the Treaty of Den Haag, by Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Austria, Portugal and Savoy to preserve Europe&rsquo;s balance of power and reclaim the throne for the Archduke Charles.&#10;&#10;The players, representing the powers of the Grand Alliance, will fight the Bourbon forces composed by French, Castilian and Bavarian troops. Their goal, defined by a hidden agenda, is to obtain the best commercial and territorial concessions, and conquer the Bourbon territories. But this is no cooperative game: the winning player will need strategy and negotiation skills to achieve the best deals with the enemy and thus be the country with the most benefits thanks to the Peace of Utrecht.&#10;&#10;In previous turn reverse order, each player decides how to play one of the seeded cards for the current turn. The players may pay from their resources to use the card&rsquo;s text or may prefer to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the card to execute one action. Each action is available only once for each turn and the players cannot execute the same action in two consecutive turns. The available actions are Recruit troops, Move them across the map or Attack the enemy in adjacent areas. Other choices include obtaining Resources or paying attention to their own countries Public Opinion (a.k.a. Will to Fight), for this will decide the order in which the new Concessions will be dealed. The card deck, composed by the most relevant battles, events and characters throughout the war, includes the exploits of the Bourbon armies to counter the player&rsquo;s actions.&#10;&#10;&#10;[Catal&agrave;]&#10;&#10;Europa, 1702. La mort del rei Carles II d&rsquo;Habsburg ha deixat el tron desocupat i ha provocat una guerra per tot Europa per arranjar la q&uuml;esti&oacute; de la successi&oacute; espanyola. L&rsquo;arxiduc Carles III d&rsquo;&Agrave;ustria, l&rsquo;hereu de la casa Habsburg, ha estat descartat pel testament de Carles II, signat gaireb&eacute; al seu llit de mort i que afavoreix Felip d&rsquo;Anjou, n&eacute;t de Llu&iacute;s XIV, l&rsquo;hereu de la casa Borb&oacute;. S&rsquo;ha format la Gran Alian&ccedil;a, pel Tractat de la Haia signat per la Gran Bretanya, les Prov&iacute;ncies Unides dels Pa&iuml;sos Baixos, &Agrave;ustria, Portugal i Savoia per mantenir l&rsquo;equilibri de poder a Europa i reclamar el tron per a l&rsquo;arxiduc Carles.&#10;&#10;Els jugadors representen els poders de la Gran Alian&ccedil;a i lluiten contra les forces borb&ograve;niques compostes per tropes franceses, castellanes i bavareses. El seu prop&ograve;sit, definit per uns objectius secrets, &eacute;s aconseguir les millors concessions territorials i comercials, i conquerir els territoris borb&ograve;nics. Per&ograve; no es tracta d&rsquo;un joc cooperatiu: al guanyador li caldr&agrave; estrat&egrave;gia i negociaci&oacute; per assolir els millors tractes amb l&rsquo;enemic i ser el pa&iacute;s m&eacute;s beneficiat per la Pau d&rsquo;Utrecht.&#10;&#10;En l&rsquo;ordre invers del torn anterior, cada jugador decideix com vol jugar una de les cartes que formen el torn actual. Els jugadors poden pagar amb els seus recursos per activar l&rsquo;esdeveniment de la carta o poden &laquo;vendre&raquo; la carta per fer una acci&oacute;. Cada acci&oacute; est&agrave; disponible un sol cop per torn i els jugadors no poden fer la mateixa acci&oacute; en dos torns consecutius. Les accions permeten als jugadors reclutar tropes, moure-les pel mapa, atacar l&rsquo;enemic situat en hex&agrave;gons adjacents, obtenir m&eacute;s recursos o millorar l&rsquo;opini&oacute; p&uacute;blica del seu pa&iacute;s. Una bona opini&oacute; p&uacute;blica &eacute;s clau a l&rsquo;hora de triar les millors concessions abans que ho facin els altres jugadors. La pila de cartes inclou les batalles, esdeveniments i personatges m&eacute;s rellevants de tota la guerra, a m&eacute;s de les vict&ograve;ries borb&ograve;niques que contrarestaran les accions dels jugadors.&#10;&#10;",

In addition, there are boxes for the East and the West Indies, and track round the edge of the board with the majority of spaces listing two of the ten provinces (in various combinations) that earn players varying amounts of income based on their influences in those provinces, or income spaces that earn players a flat income.&#10;&#10;The aim of the players is to be the first player to earn 33 victory points, which are acquired through earning money to extend influence in the provinces, patronize artists, invest in businesses, establish colonies in the Indies, or obtain civic advancements.  These are represented by purchasing cards from one of six decks, with each deck having a special focus.  Investment cards provide cash payouts, with bigger payouts for collecting sets of different values (single cards are worth less than three-card sets).  Artists provide a potentially large source of victory points, but require multiple turns of patronage (i.e., cash) before they pay out.  Colonization cards provide ships, captains, and cannons to outfit expeditions to establish colonies which earn victory points and access to the higher-paying spice investment card deck.  Civics cards can provide governorships in the provinces (victory points and income), civic improvements (victory points), a special action that allows the holder to alter the normal rules for advancing a token on the board track.  There are cards that work with some of the other decks as well, in the civics deck (e.g., investments, expedition components, etc).&#10;&#10;",

You'll fight on three fronts with armies you create for each battle, making every battle a new experience.&#10;&#10;Each Pocket Battles game depicts two armies. The rules for combat are the same in each Pocket Battles game so you can have armies from different series fighting: Elves vs. Romans! WW2 soldiers vs. Napoleonic forces! It's all possible with Pocket Battles.&#10;&#10;The basic rules of the game are simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).&#10;&#10;On you turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on you unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).&#10;&#10;After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back row to the front row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.&#10;&#10;The battle is over when one army defeats the other.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;60 tiles, 6 dice, 20 wound/order tokens, 2 player aids, 1 set of rules.&#10;&#10;Macedonians: 1 agema, 2 agriganes, 1 alexandros, 1 argyraspides, 1 chiliarch, 5 cretan archers, 4 hetairoi, 4 hypaspistai, 4 peltasts, 4 pezhetairoi, 2 prodromoi and 1 standard bearer.&#10;&#10;Persians: 6 archers, 1 baivarapatis, 1 chariot, 1 darius, 2 elephants, 3 immortals, 3 kardaka, 3 levies, 3 median calary, 1 scyted chariot, 2 sparabara, 1 standard bearer and 3 takabara.&#10;&#10;",

You can't trust anyone and no one will trust you, so block the doors, quarantine a suspect, reveal your identity to your &quot;allies&quot;, grab a flamethrower, or run away &mdash; but look carefully where you will end up because &quot;The Thing&quot; might be closer than you think...&#10;&#10;In Stay Away!, 4-12 players try to track down &quot;The Thing&quot;, a creature &#226;&#128;&#168;awakened from a nauseating eternal slumber on the emerged R'lyeh island that has the capability of possessing the human body, cloning it, then taking its place, so as you play you won't know who &quot;The Thing&quot; is or when someone will become &quot;The Thing&quot; or who is infected or not. The archaeologists are looking for The Thing; their goal is to work together to identify which player is The Thing and roast it with a &quot;Flamethrower&quot; card. You remain Human until The Thing passes an &quot;Infected!&quot; card to you during a card exchange, at which point you become an Infected and take on that new Role: You are now an ally of The Thing and must take care that its identity is not revealed.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in turns that represent five days.  A unit's strength point represents approximately 2,500 men commanded by a leader.  The map is a 1:200,000 representation of an area between Fredricksburg and Petersburg.&#10;&#10;The game is split into two: Basic and Advanced.  The basic game introduces players to the concepts of movement and unit activation.  The advanced game adds sea movement, supply, and additional leader rules. Victory conditions depends on the scenario being played.&#10;&#10;Lee vs. Grant is arguably the first game in the GCACW series by the same designer albeit from a different (though related) publisher and with a different map art style.&#10;&#10;",

Meanwhile, the player controlling Michael Myers will stalk them - and because he is only visible when someone is looking directly at him, he will be an ever-present danger throughout the game. The Myers player can win by killing enough characters, or by preventing the players from escaping for long enough.

One player controls the French forces, and the other player controls the Viet Minh forces.&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1954, General Giap shocked the world by doing what had previously been considered impossible&mdash;defeating a Western occupying force. Storm Over Dien Bien Phu simulates the climactic moment when the isolated French forces (composed of French legionnaires and elite paratrooper units), and crumbled under the unrelenting pressure of the Chinese&ndash;backed Viet Minh forces.&#10;&#10;Using the Area Move system redefined in Storm Over Stalingrad, the game features the use of cards to augment game play, adding to the tension experienced by both sides.

    "Description": "Civil war has broken out between two royal brothers over the succession of the kingdom, and the people of a once-peaceful nation must choose sides and rush to war. Even when the sun goes down, the war for the crown does not cease. While the battle rages on during the day, both princes and their armies still hope to catch the other unawares under the blanket of darkness. Neither side is safe even then, however, and so both princes are well prepared - they've gone through lengths to recruit special units to surprise their enemy, including a Phantom to cloak itself and hopefully use the darkness to its advantage in order to capture the rival King and Heirs.&#10;&#10;In For the Crown, you must gather key resources, train an army from scratch, and capture the rival King and Heirs to prove your claim to the throne!&#10;&#10;In this game that combines the highly popular &quot;deck-building&quot; mechanic with the most engrossing variations of Chess, do you have what it takes to wisely divide your attention between preparations and military maneuvering? To outpace your opponent&rsquo;s development while eluding capture?

But watch out! Rival cult leaders may try to sabotage you or convert the followers you can&rsquo;t keep in line. You might also garner unwanted attention from pesky investigators who try to get in your way. Persuade the right followers, outwit your foes, and rise above the rest.&#10;&#10;In the game CULTivate, you work to collect follower meeples needed to match the pattern of your character's agenda. Play cards from your hand allowing you to gain followers, manage follower placement within your compound, and sabotage rival cult leaders. As you draw cards, Undercover Investigations can pop up and add investigators to your compound stopping you from recruiting followers. Not gaining the type of followers you want? Make exchanges with follower meeples in the supply to help you complete your agenda and fill your compound. As you recruit followers you will activate powers making it easier for you to fill your compound. When a player fills their compound, the end of the game is triggered. Players tally the points of their followers, points from completed agendas, and any earned bonuses to see who comes out on top.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st &amp; 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value. The designer David Watts has published a lot of stand alone Railway Rivals maps, and there is another edition of this game, Dampfross published by Laurin.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Dampfross&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Battle your friends, family, and hyper-intelligent pets by drawing and playing from a deck of unique cards that'll either help you, thwart others, or mix things up for the sheer hell of it! To win the game, you just need to start your turn with exactly 10 cards in your hand but if you think that'll be easy, you're wrong (wronger than a duck wearing shoes- and that's pretty damn wrong).&#10;&#10;Players draw a card on their turn and can choose to &quot;place&quot; up to three trap cards out of their hand. As a second part of their turn they either pick up one card or play one action card, which are all unique and can have wide-ranging consequences on the other players or game as a whole&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player wins when someone starts their turn holding exactly 10 cards.&#10;&#10;So, if you're looking for a hilarious and unpredictable game, I hear Cards Against Humanity is pretty fun! But since you probably own that already, maybe give Muffin Time a chance.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Artwork is from the &quot;asdfmovie&quot; YouTube series by Thomas Ridgewell.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We are in the early XXth century, but the world is not as we know it. In 1895, exploring Amazonia, Auguste Copperpot discovered a gate to a lost valley, occupied by a primitive civilisation. Wiraqocha Valley was the name he gave to this remote Eden. This world enclosed a treasure that was going to revolutionize modern sciences, namely the Somnium, an orange luminescent crystal showing amazing properties. It can be used as fuel, affects matter and even time. Immediately, this virgin land became a new Eldorado for European colonists. Empress Victoria II decided to send several conglomerates to share this promised land and reap the fruits to her benefit. Zeppelin fleet, full of scientists, adventurers and looters, clouded the Atlantic sky.&#10;&#10;Wiraqocha Valley is represented by an adjustable board consisting of 22 hexagonal tiles, each of them being identified by a number from 1 to 12, or a dice combo (pairs or straights). In his turn, each player rolls some six-sided dice, combining them to take possession of territories, or to protect from the opponents the ones he already owns. Every hexagon affords resources or special capacities, which are means to influence die results to fit one&rsquo;s strategy. There are three ways to win: bring back a huge cargo of Somnium to the Empress; acquire enough scientific knowledge to build the Leviathan, a terrifying weapon serving the Kingdom; or find in the temple depths the four relics that will allow you to reach Wiraqocha&rsquo;s treasure.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Skytear Horde: Monoliths is stand-alone expansion to Skytear Horde, the lane-based card battler in which one or two players fight against the horde of monsters controlled by the game.&#10;&#10;Players say Skytear Horde gives them the feeling of playing a solo or cooperative version of competitive card battlers such as Keyforge, Hearthstone, or Magic: the Gathering.&#10;&#10;In the six lanes of the battlefield monsters attack your castle while beyond the enemy line smaller minions pillage your resources, forcing you to discard cards from your deck each turn.&#10;&#10;You lose the battle if your castle is destroyed or your deck runs out of cards.&#10;&#10;You win if you destroy the portal spawning the monsters and the epic monster leading the horde.&#10;&#10;There are many interesting choices on the tactical and strategic level: strike a balance between defending and counter-attacking but also fighting the minions pillaging your deck and the monsters destroying your castle.&#10;&#10;While you juggle all these decisions you also have to be careful not to run out of cards, as the principal way to draw new cards is to destroy monsters!&#10;&#10;Skytear Horde is really quick to setup, play, and store away.&#10;There are 3 difficulty levels suitable for complete beginners and veterans alike.&#10;&#10;In just a few seconds you can restart a new game giving it a strong &ldquo;just one more try&rdquo; aspect.&#10;&#10;Out of the retail box there are 3 ready-made alliance decks with different play styles and 3 horde decks with their own boss.&#10;All decks can be mixed and customized to provide additional combinations.&#10;&#10;Monoliths features a revised rulebook and streamlined gameplay that improves upon the original thanks to the direct interaction between the designers and thousands of players.&#10;&#10;In Monoliths there are many new themes and mechanics refreshing the game on all the fronts. &#10;For the horde, the &quot;Charge&quot; keyword brings the minion into the lanes for one turn threatening your castle while &quot;Reinforce X&quot; makes the weaker minions stronger. The 4 new hordes also features unique strategies and play-styles: for instance the Sinklings conceal themselves entering play face-down, while the Broods will fill the backline with Brood tokens that are essentially additional minions!&#10;&#10;For the alliance, not even contemplating the four new pre-made decks, one fundamental change is that you must exhaust an ally in order to move it, giving even more meaning and depth to the positioning of your allies. &#10;Cards are also designed with more potential combo's than ever, allowing for the power level to reach higher ceiling... something that you absolutely need given the brand new difficulty system that is designed around 3 variations of every single horde card, at 3 different power levels.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

If any one team is completely defeated, or if 10 or more total Heroes are defeated, the players cannot stop the Fire Nation and have lost the game.&#10; At the start of each turn, the active player will choose one of three locations to visit.

    "Description": "Tide of Iron: Next Wave was released under license by 1A Games in 2014. It is the second edition of Tide of Iron (which was first released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2007).&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron: Next Wave and Tide of Iron are essentially the same game. Overall, Tide of Iron: Next Wave is much more informative and organized. The rules are improved with corrected errors which make it better than the rules found in the 2007 edition. Also, a few of the scenarios have been adjusted for better game play. These and other improvements make this edition better than the older edition. Also included in Tide of Iron: Next Wave are some additional and useful items that were later introduced to TOI in some of the game expansions. Because of these differences, the two products have different entries on BoardGameGeek. For more information about the older 2007 version of Tide of Iron, you can Click Here.&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron is a game of World War II tactical conflict for two to four players. The components in this base game allow players to simulate the dramatic struggle that took place between American and German forces in Northern Europe during the years 1944 and 1945.&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron is a scenario-based game, with the available forces, objectives, map, and victory conditions being set by each given scenario. It features loads of plastic figures, including soldiers, equipment, heavy weapons, and combat vehicles, cards, dice, cardboard markers, and modular game boards that will represent the customizable terrain of this scenario-based wargame.&#10;&#10;The twelve double-sided map tiles, plus the dozens of included terrain hexes, allow for limitless potential combinations, and each scenario can be enhanced by special rules, objective markers, troop allotments, and other variations. The only limiting factor is your imagination!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The use of various symbols and devices to signify individuals and groups dates to the age of antiquity. Warriors often decorated their shields with patterns and mythological creatures.&#10;&#10;Heraldry refers to the design, display and study of armorial bearings, a shield used to identify a person or family. The concepts and systems of regular heraldic designs were developed by heraldic officers between 1000 AD and 1300 AD during a period known as the High Middle Ages.&#10;&#10;Originally conceived to assist with identification in battle, the beauty and intricacy of various heraldic designs meant that they survived the abandonment of armor on the battlefield and preserved the honor of the family line. To this day, we still see their use by individuals, organizations, corporations, towns, cities, and regions.&#10;&#10;To blazon arms means to describe them in the language of Heraldry, which has its own vocabulary, syntax and grammar based strongly on an anglicized version of Norman French.&#10;&#10;A game of Blazon allows you to act as a herald, designing your own heraldic shield by acquiring elements, placing them on your Shield board, and earning distinctions through careful choices.&#10;&#10;Objective&#10;Players score Prestige by placing Element cards on their Shield board. Players can score bonus Prestige by earning distinctions for their shields. The player with the most Prestige at the end of the game wins and is crowned the King of Arms.&#10;&#10;Playing Blazon&#10;Blazon is played in sequential turns. On your turn, you must take either an Acquire action OR a Blazon action.&#10;&#10;If performing the Acquire action, you may draw two Element cards from either the Tincture deck, Device deck, or one from each. You may keep both of these cards or exchange one (or both) for cards from the face-up display.&#10;&#10;Performing the Blazon action allows you to place Element cards from your hand onto your Shield board. You choose which card to place, ensuring that you meet the matching Device or Tincture requirement on your Shield board. To place a card, you must discard any number of cards from your hand, the combined Prestige Value of which equals or exceeds the Prestige Value of the Element card that you wish to place on your Shield board.&#10;&#10;Herald Actions&#10;Once per turn, at any time during your turn, regardless of which action was taken, you may discard one of your Herald tokens to take any one of the following Herald actions: Discard and refresh the display, Take any single card from the display, Place an Element card of any value on your shield for the cost of 1, or Take the top card from the Tincture or Device discard pile.&#10;&#10;End of Game&#10;The end game is triggered immediately when any one of the following happen:&#10;&bull; A player lands on or passes 50 Prestige on their Prestige track.&#10;&bull; A player fills every space on their Shield board.&#10;&bull; A player claims their final Distinction award.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a fantasy world dominated by goblins, when the blood moon rises in the sky, a new war begins and new warlords raise their armies.&#10;&#10;GOSU 2: Tactics plays like a hybrid of Race for the Galaxy and Magic: The Gathering with each player trying to recruit an army of goblins made up of soldiers, heroes, magicians, and other classes &ndash; then swing it into action against the other players. Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, use a goblin's power, draw cards, or pass. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles. The first player to win three battles wins the game.&#10;&#10;While the game play in GOSU2 remains much the same as in GOSU, some changes make it a different game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The game no longer includes activation tokens, which were used to draw cards or activate a goblin's power.&#10;    All text has been removed from the cards to make them (and the game as a whole) fully multilingual.&#10;    Goblin abilities are now based on seven symbols, each with a basic and a MAX version.&#10;    The game includes a new &laquo;link&raquo; ability.&#10;    The goblin clans are structured differently.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, all cards are &quot;cold foil&quot; printed to make them shiny.

The pilots try to manouver their powership quickly, while rounding three space buoys and finally landing on the finish planet.&#10;&#10;The modular board in Powerships consists of 16 tiles to build different solar system constellations. Altogether this board contains about 662 race hexagon spaces around the sun, with all solar system planets and several space dust hexagons in between.&#10;&#10;The dice system, with 3-sided dice, simulates accelerating and decelerating. At the start of each turn, you have your dice showing your speed from your former turn. You may add or remove 1 die maximum. For the dice you keep from your former turn, you can choose which to roll and which to keep unchanged! Then, before moving your powership, you can turn it one side to the left or right in its hexagon space. Now, move it by the speed determined by the sum of the numbers on your dice.&#10;&#10;Finding the best route for your powership is a challenge because space dust, planets, and the sun block your paths. Crashing into them makes you lose your speed and damages your powership, which limits your maximum number of dice. Other powerships might possibly occupy your desired space, though you can also use them as a bumper to reach a desired space.&#10;&#10;Special spaces make your powership shift a space, turn to the left or right, double your speed, or make you move over/under obstacles.&#10;&#10;",

Choose to remain an independent vagabond, or maybe cut a deal with a Governor to become all official-like in your pirating ways. Consult with a shaman to curse the other pirates or pay a visit to the cartographer to find a map with some hidden treasure.&#10;&#10;In the game, the turn begins with players choosing the character card whose action they want to play &mdash; because each character has its own ability to help you get rich quickly &mdash; and places it facedown in front of them. When everyone has chosen their character cards, the first player announces the characters one by one. When you hear your character, you reveal your character card and play your adventure, curse, or port card, and everyone gets involved in a new adventure, which usually ends with a grandiose sea battles, or some curse, or finding a new port.&#10;&#10;The pirate with the most booty wins the day, but a pirate's life isn't always on the up and up.

    "Description": "&quot;Lost Battles&quot; is forty games in one. The game covers battles and campaigns in the Mediterranean and Near East from the Persian defeat at Marathon in 490 BC to Caesar's victory at Pharsalus in 48 BC.  It has been exhaustively tested and refined over the past several years, and is based on Professor Philip Sabin's decades of research and simulation design on ancient warfare; and it includes an updated copy of his book, with extensive historical and design notes on every scenario.&#10;&#10;The game can be fought on three levels - the grand tactical, the grand strategic, or a combination of the two.  At the grand tactical level, 1 or 2 players may refight any of 35 different land battles such as Leuctra, Gaugamela, Raphia, Cannae, Cynoscephalae or the Sambre - far more than in any other single boxed game.  At the grand strategic level, 1 to 4 players may refight the epic duels of the two centuries from 350 to 150 BC, starting with the eclipse of Achaemenid Persia by Alexander of Macedon, and ending with Hannibal's campaigns and the conquest of Carthage and the Hellenistic states by the resurgent Roman republic.  The most ambitious games combine these two levels, and see 1 to 4 players using tactical battles to resolve strategic campaigns across part or all of this two century period, or else refighting a series of historical battles to decide conflicts such as the three-cornered contest for dominance between Athens, Sparta and Thebes from the start of the Peloponnesian War to the death of Epaminondas.&#10;&#10;The accent throughout is on combining historical accuracy with speed and accessibility.  The free-standing strategic game may be completed in just 30 minutes, while individual land battles may be re-fought in two hours or less.  There is constant player interaction, and a series of tortuous dilemmas - how should the scarce command points be allocated across the battlefront, which troop types should be put in the lead against particular opponents, should units attack all-out at the cost of becoming exhausted themselves, and should generals join the fighting to rally their disheartened men at the risk of being killed and so making things far worse?  The game includes all the many troop types from hoplites, legionaries, phalangites and archers to cataphracts, scythed chariots and war elephants, and it includes simple rules to reflect the huge differences in generalship and troop quality and to allow outclassed armies to win a handicapped 'game victory' even if they are defeated on the field, as long as they do better than they did historically.  All aspects of the game are avowedly solitaire-friendly, and can be run by a single player swapping sides just as easily as by one or more players per side.&#10;&#10;Tactical battles are fought on a 5 x 4 grid of full-colour 5 inch square hard mounted terrain tiles, which dovetail to form any desired battlefield.  The individually die-cut counters have rounded corners and are also in full-colour; they depict the various different troop types. The strategic game is fought on a hard mounted map showing the area from Spain to India.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Epic PVP: Fantasy is a head-to-head battling card game. At the start of the game, each player chooses a class deck and a race deck, then shuffles them together to create unique character combinations, such as a Human Paladin or Goblin Druid. Each combination creates unique tactics and strategies to use when you battle.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reducing them to zero life. Players do this by playing moves that act as both attacks and blocks as well as with special cards and abilities granted by the player's choice of class and race.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player adds cards to their &quot;aggression pile&quot;, then chooses how many cards to draw from their aggression pile into their hand. The player uses the aggression provided by the cards that remain in their aggression pile to play move cards to block incoming enemy attacks. If an attack isn't blocked, the player takes damage, specifically one damage per unblocked enemy attack. Then all the moves played by that player become attacks for the opponent to deal with on the opponent's next turn. There's more to it than that, but those are the basics...&#10;&#10;",

The villages, now faced with destruction, must do whatever they can to protect their homes from the incoming surge of lava.&#10;&#10;Your village is about to burn up &mdash; can you take the heat?&#10;&#10;Eruption is a competitive survival game in which each player struggles to save his or her own village from destruction caused by an onslaught of lava from an erupting volcano. As lava enters a village, its temperature increases until it has burned up completely. Players can protect their own villages by placing lava tiles defensively and strategically building walls of various materials to hold back the lava. They are also rewarded with action cards for directing lava to other villages. Action cards allow players to rotate, replace, or remove the hexagonal lava tiles as well as cool down and fortify their own villages. Once the volcano has fully unleashed its fury, the player whose village is at the lowest temperature wins.&#10;&#10;",

For example, Ladybohn: Manche m&ouml;gen's heiss! still has six &quot;Gartenbohnen&quot;, but now four of the cards are male, one is female, and one is a baby; there are 21 &quot;Blauen Bohnen&quot;, 11 of which are male, with five females and five babies.  As with the original Ladybohn expansion, the female beans have better beanometers than the male beans, so if you harvest a field with a lady on top, you'll likely receive more coins. The new babies have no beanometer, so harvesting a field topped by a baby is worthless; when a baby is planted in a field, however, a female bean in the field can move two cards toward the top of the stack, which means the babies can bring the superior females where they are needed most.&#10;&#10;In English, Ladybohn: Manche m&ouml;gen's heiss! is included in the standalone expansion Bohnanza: Ladies &amp; Gangsters.&#10;&#10;",

All other cards do not score any points.&#10;Each player is dealt 3 cards with one turned up as the trump suit. Play does not need to follow suit and the winner of each trick replenishes their hand first. The total points in each game are 120 and whoever has the higher scoring wins a manche of the game.&#10;Play with 3-6 players just takes a few minor adjustments to the rules or cards and the versions for 4-6 are played with partnerships.&#10;Usually this game allows speaking between teammates, but no gestures (or only over-table gestures).&#10;Two interesting variants are:&#10;- &quot;Briscola scoperta&quot; in which all the cards are face up and visible by all players.&#10;- &quot;chiamata&quot;, played with 5 players (3 vs 2).

Few games have received as much universal praise or have been played by so many gamers across the globe.&#10;&#10;Consim Press has embarked on a special journey and partnership with the original game designer, John Edwards, to produce this unequivocal, beautifully-rendered, new edition that honors the elegant design approach of the original creator and pays tribute to one of the finest games ever published. Reflective that this goes far beyond a simple reprint effort, this all-new edition has been in the works for more than one year as the aim is to present the ultimate &ldquo;final say&rdquo; of this design as John Edwards intended.&#10;&#10;This Deluxe 5th Edition of The Russian Campaign includes numerous rules changes by leveraging the expertise and experience of today&rsquo;s leading experts and world renown players who have organized numerous TRC tournament events and online support sites. These changes reflect more than thirty years of player experience as well as outcomes from recent research.  Examples of the former include additional balancing rules and providing more examples of play while examples of the latter include modifications to Archangel-based replacements and German Minor Ally restrictions.  Players of earlier versions of TRC will be able to immediately play the 5th edition but the designer, publisher, and developers are steadfast in their belief that the current rules make it even easier for new players to quickly get into the game.&#10;&#10;The end result is a perfect blend of the game&rsquo;s classical, core system with key enhancements and clarifications driven by the best gaming minds in the world associated with this game who have invested literally thousands of hours over the years &ndash; in both playing and supporting the game.&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS&#10;&#10;     Multiple Impulse Movement and Combat&#10;     Rail Movement and Rail Conversion&#10;     Sea Movement (transfers, invasions, and evacuations)&#10;     Off-board movement and encirclements&#10;     HQs and Leaders&#10;     Russian Paratroops, Partisans, Warsaw Garrison&#10;     Air Power &ndash; Stukas and Sturmoviks&#10;     Reinforcement and Replacements&#10;     Sudden Death Victory Conditions&#10;     Numerous Optional rules featuring: Strategic Movement, SS Replenishment, Russian Recovery, Industrial Evacuation, Fortress Cities, Historical Weather, Battlegroups, Artillery, Russian Artillery Barrage, Optional Worker Units, National Restrictions, Historical Naval Restrictions, Hungarian Neutrality, Competitive Bidding for Sides&#10;     Replete with Variant/Experimental Rules as published over the past 30 years, including counters&#10;&#10;&#10;Five Game Scenarios and Full Campaign Game&#10;&#10;&#10;     THE BREAKING STORM Scenario, 5 Turns (May/June &rsquo;41 &ndash; Jan/Feb &rsquo;42)&#10;     BARBAROSSA Scenario, 10 Turns (May/June 1941 - Nov/Dec 1942)&#10;     FALL BLAU Scenario, 8 Turns (May/June 1942 &ndash; July/Aug 1943)&#10;     ZITADELLE Scenario, 6 Turns (May/June 1943 &ndash; Mar/April 1944)&#10;     BAGRATION Scenario, 7 Turns (May/June 1944 &ndash; May/June 1945)&#10;     FULL CAMPAIGN GAME, 25 Turns (May/June 1941 &ndash; May/June 1945)&#10;&#10;&#10;GAME CONTENTS&#10;&#10;     Two full size maps, including small map overlay for Lwow Hills optional rule&#10;     Three 5/8&rdquo; full-color counter sheets (both NATO and icon style counters included for AFV units)&#10;     Full color, illustrated Rules booklet&#10;     Four full color Order of Battle Displays&#10;     Three full color Scenario Set-up Cards&#10;     Four full color Player Aid Cards&#10;     Single 6-sided die&#10;     Boxed&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Agents of SMERSH: Epic Edition&#10;&#10;The Game: &#10;In Agents of SMERSH: Epic Edition, the most EPIC Narrative Storytelling game of all time, 1-4 players take on the roles of Elite Government Spies traveling the world in search of Dr. Lobo and his Henchmen on an EPIC mission to stop them from taking over the world. Players use their Advanced Skills, Top Secret Spy Gear, and Allies as they traverse exotic locations in order to locate Dr. Lobo and his Henchmen. A simple dice mechanic is utilized to resolve encounters.&#10;&#10;Our Epic Edition takes Agents of SMERSH to a whole new level by focusing on the most Epic part of the game - The Story - while giving the graphic design a fresh upgrade and streamlining some of the older mechanics to provide a more focused, engaging experience. For example, where you travel to on the world map now provides you with different bonuses and upgrades amongst the many hundreds of unique encounters. Instead of collecting Intel just to win the game, you now collect it to locate and encounter Dr. Lobo&rsquo;s Henchmen, and eventually Dr. Lobo himself. Henchmen and Dr. Lobo have their own individual &ldquo;Choose your Own Adventure-like&rdquo; stories and encounters. Defeat one or all of the Henchmen first and you&rsquo;ll gain an advantage against Dr. Lobo in the End Game.&#10;&#10;Did you defeat Dr. Lobo? Are you sure? In the Epic Edition of SMERSH, there may be more than one Dr. Lobo. So it seems . . . something strange is going on in the world.&#10;&#10;The Story Briefing:&#10;&#10;The Director of the United Nations Intelligence Committee has contacted you through a secure channel. He tells you that hundreds of Secret Government Spies worldwide have been disappearing and turning up dead. Only the best of the best, the elite of the elite are still alive: YOU are one of those Spies. He&rsquo;s putting together a global inter-agency cooperating task force, and he needs your help to prevent more death and to stop the world&rsquo;s most infamous evil mastermind, Dr. Lobo. Reports say that Lobo has put together his own force, a force for evil and death called &ldquo;SMERSH&rdquo; with objectives not only to bring &ldquo;Death to all Spies&rdquo; but ultimately to take over the world using his most influential and powerful henchmen.&#10;&#10;Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to work together with our other allied spies to bring down Lobo&rsquo;s henchmen and force them to lead you to Lobo himself. Once you find Lobo, take him down by any means necessary. &quot;I will do whatever I can to help from here in the UN, all of our resources, tech, spy gear, and Intel are yours for the taking. We have other agents out in the field, in hiding now, perhaps to meet you on your encounters in the field. Do your best to stay alive, and bring down Lobo and his Henchmen as soon as possible. Good Luck.&quot; - The Director&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The old king is dying without an heir, and the country is in turmoil. Four lords have come to the capital city, each claiming to be the king's rightful successor. Now the lords are vying for control of the city, for they know that who ever wins the city will win the throne. You and your opponents are playing the feudal lords, trying to secure your claims by surrounding the most important locations in the capital (such as the palace, the royal library, and the wizard's tower) with shops, barracks, and other city districts under your control. Watch where you place your districts, however, because your opponents may build their neighborhoods over yours, or worse - send the dragon to burn your territory down. King's Gate is a tense game about tile-laying and destruction.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We are the last members of a peculiar decapod crustacean species: the square crabs from the Gironde estuary. From an evolutionary standpoint, we're not that useful, notably because... Well, we physically can't turn. We're bound to walk in a straight line all our life. And not even straight, but&hellip; Crab steering! Not exactly an interesting life... Especially for those born between two rocks.&#10;&#10;We're not that moronic though, because, after only a few hundred thousand years, we realized that with two crabs who take turns climbing on top of each other, we could move in a grid pattern in all our environment! New horizons beckoned us!&#10;&#10;Let's use this discovery to free our buddies, who are trapped under items left on the beach by careless humans, whilst avoiding our sworn enemies: the formidable yet stupid brown crabs and the terrifying and sly lobsters...&#10;&#10;La Marche du Crabe is a super immersive cooperative deduction game, in which the two playful crabs will be completely dependent on each other... not to mention! You have often seen crabs discuss, will you?&#10;&#10;An evolving game!&#10;To ensure an unlimited lifespan and a growing challenge, the game is scalable, with eleven Scenario cards and as many new challenges!&#10;The promise of unlimited play and always new games!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;On their turn, the player must play a Baddie card on the beach and then move the crabs token. If they stop on an Item Card, their friend tells whether if it's a forbidden item or not.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;&#10;To win, the two players must free together their 8 crab buddies before they cannot place Baddie cards on the beach. Moreover, shrimps being life points, players lose if they must use shrimps and they don't have anymore!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Despite earlier attempts, Martin Luther started the Reformation in 1517 with his &quot;Ninety-Five Theses&quot;. Luther criticized the selling of indulgences and stated that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the gospel. The &quot;Protestants&quot; soon incorporated doctrinal changes such as Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone) and Sola Fide (faith alone). These changes turned out to be not only theological, but also influential in the Reformation in other ways: the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded people's faith in the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much of traditional thought. The Roman Catholic church responded with a counter-reformation initiated by the Council of Trent.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game Sola Fide: The Reformation, by the renowned design team of Jason Mathews and Christian Leonhard, players attempt to install Reformation in the Holy Roman Empire or try to prevent it, battling the Holy Roman Empire's Imperial Circles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A fantasy miniatures game that is based on the same system as De Bellis Antiquitatis: Quick Play Wargame Rules with Army Lists for Ancient and Medieval Battles and De Bellis Multitudinis: Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles &#226;&#128;&#147; 3000 BC to 1500 AD. The first edition was published in 1991, with a much more clearly written second edition being published in 2002. The game consists of a single rulebook.&#10;&#10;The player's miniatures are organized onto stands or 'elements', an army consisting of about 10-14 such elements. Troop types range from powerful Heroes, Magicians, and Dragons, through such things as Blades, Riders, and Spears and down to the humble Hordes of the game title.&#10;&#10;Movement is alternate, with each player dicing for action points (PIPs) which allow them to move single elements or groups of elements, deploy certain element types and use magicians to be-spell enemy troops. Combat between elements is resolved by each player rolling a die and adding the element's combat factor. Highest score wins, with some elements automatically destroying others and most others being destroyed if their final score is half, or less, than that of the opponent.&#10;&#10;The strength of the game is that there are no 'fixed' armies. With only a few restrictions (concerned with which elements can be generals and the proportion of 'powerful' troop types) you can construct your army any way you wish. This means you can create armies to represent those from any work of fantasy fiction, myth, legend, film, TV, anything else that your imagination desires. A large number of example army lists, from a variety of sources, are included in the rules book.&#10;&#10;",
