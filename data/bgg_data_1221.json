Led by fearsome bosses like Penny 2020, Sister Blister, and The Machine, these Super-Villains along with their loyal Minions are taking over midtown. The citizens' hopes rest with you.

Same for your defense, it is the defense card and your Base Defense stat added together. If your overall attack is higher than the monsters overall attack damage is dealt to the monster.

Once the monster's health is brought down to 0 the tower shifts down and you battle the next monster.&#10;&#10;Every two monsters beaten the Tower rewards you with a random item that can help you defeat the Tower easier.

    "Description": "A solo tactical game about the battles and struggles that the 1st Airborne division faced during the first few days of the drops and landings around the Arnhem/Oosterbeek area.&#10;&#10;You play as the British in this chit pull, paragraph driven game, the enemy may not be placed on the map until you spot them, or they spot you.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins there are decisions to make. Which attached units do you want to add and how much additional ammo do you want to take. These come at a cost of a time/VP deduction. &#10;Flip a chit and obey the instructions, chits allow platoons or groups to be activated, as well as passing of time, mortar actions, minefields and wire activations, random events etc. When one of your platoons is activated you give the platoon one of four orders, Hold, Advance, Assault or Recce. These orders allow your sections to make an action. As well as the usual combat,  movement and morale test other actions include spotting and special commanders actions such as the off map 3&quot; mortar and sending a runner to replenish ammo. Certain orders will make the chosen actions easier to execute and more successful. A Hold order for example will not allow a move action, although a regroup action is possible. A Recce order will allow you to spot easier and not to be spotted by the enemy as easily but will not allow you to enter into combat.&#10;&#10;After the action phase has been completed for your platoon, a paragraph check is made. This will allow you to spot enemy units, buildings, bridges, be aware of any terrain modifiers within the hex. The level of awareness is attached to the actions and orders of your platoon. If you go charging around the map with an Assault order, don't be surprised to run into mines and wire and making the enemy aware of your position without spotting them in return as well as having less command over these units.&#10;&#10;The VPs are directly connected to the number of turns it takes to complete the game. But do not get complacent as you are never sure what lies ahead until you have read that last paragraph.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Italians learned about modern warfare the hard way in 1940. Now they are back, showing the world what the Italian soldier can do. Fighting under the famous 'Desert Fox', General Rommel, they form a crucial part of the Italian-German Panzer Army. Tough, determined, skilled, and aggressive veterans, the Italians broke through the British Gazala Line to save the trapped German Afrika Korps, held the line at El Alamein, and opened the way at Kasserine Pass, before holding up the American offensive at El Guettar. Fight or die for the new Roman Empire!&#10;&#10;This book gives you a whole new way of fighting in the desert. The Italians are more lightly equipped, but more determined than the Germans and British. Their infantry is as numerous as the Americans, but more experienced.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Many have died and many have become powerful beyond comprehension, thus becoming Gods.&#10;&#10;The Gods have then created other realms. Filled them with magic and creatures of all kinds. But with one selfish purpose in mind. To ensure a never-ending stream of the most valuable resource - blood.&#10;&#10;Every war, every disagreement, and even the smallest quarrel between Gods is therefore settled on the Bloodfields. And Gods always bring the greatest warriors from their realms to remain invincible!&#10;&#10;This world is driven by conflict.&#10;&#10;Bloodfields feature dynamic and simple yet engaging gameplay. To keep things action-packed each skirmish takes up to 60 minutes and features a team of chosen ones on each side.&#10;&#10;To make every Bloodfields experience truly unique, there is a wide range of scenarios that enhance the gameplay. Each scenario has its individual rules, dedicated terrain, and surprising events. It&rsquo;s up to you to prepare the winning strategy for each occasion, whether it is an endless siege or escorting a deranged mage.&#10;&#10;",

Another player collects a sum of 20 or greater DNA material.&#10;2.    A player collects 10 schematics cards to complete the process of building an escape ship.&#10;3.    You lose all survivors in your faction.&#10;&#10;Collecting DNA Cards&#10;Perhaps the easiest way to win is to collect DNA cards. Each has a value listed on it which denotes the value of the DNA within. Collect a sum of 20 or more to win. This can be done in four ways:&#10;&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143;    You can defeat a zombie to collect 1 DNA card.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143;    You can obtain them through bartering with other factions (players).&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143;    You can steal or syphon them from other players.&#10;&#10;Turns and Turn Actions&#10;&#10;Each player has several actions they can take during a turn. These determine how the game progresses and are listed below:&#10;&#10;1.    Place a card in play. This varies based on type of card, but generally there are no limits to the amount of cards you can have / place in play throughout the duration of a game or in a single turn.&#10;&#10;The exception to this is Survivor cards, of which you can only have a maximum of 10.&#10;2.    Draw a Threat card. This must be done every turn. You will either need to resolve your battle or you will have the freedom to take one or more other actions. [See Battle Resolution]&#10;3.    Sacrifice 2 cards to draw from the DNA Deck.&#10;4.    Sacrifice 2 cards to draw from the Tools Deck.&#10;&#10;Of these four potential actions, #1 and #4 have no limitation on the number of times they can be performed during a turn. #2 and #3 can only be performed once per turn.&#10;&#10;Finally, the player must make sure they have no more than 6 cards of any type in their hand at the end of the round. If you have more than six cards in hand you must make a decision as to which you&rsquo;d like to discard, or offer them to other players in order to make a deal.&#10;&#10;Once a player has performed all four of, or the actions they desire to perform for that turn, turn order moves to the next person in gameplay. When it isn&rsquo;t your turn there are a few things you can do as well.&#10;&#10;1.    Barter with other players. This includes assisting them, or bribing them so that you don&rsquo;t hinder them.&#10;2.    Play cards against other players. This can come from your hand only, not previously active cards.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this way until winning conditions are fulfilled by one faction player.&#10;&#10;",

But it&rsquo;s especially his messengers&rsquo; guild, the Chascis, which makes it so famous.&#10;Inkalam's prosperity depends on the quality of the messages transmitted by the Chascis. You will have to ensure the messages get delivered during a long day, from dawn to sunset.&#10;&#10;The first player rolls the 3 dice, chooses one and puts it aside. Then all other players can choose one of the values presented by the 2-remaining dice.&#10;&#10;Each player writes the chosen value on one of the Messages located on a Road starting from an already circled Messenger. Then they have to circle the Messenger at the other end of the Road.&#10;&#10;If all the Messages located on the Roads surrounding a Region contain consecutive numbers (not necessarily in order), the player cross off a box of the Resource of this Region on their Scoreboard, starting with the lowest value. The next time for this Resource, the player will cross off the next higher value. At the end of the game, for each Resources (Lacustrine City, Corn Fields, and Lamas Herd), each player adds the value of the last box crossed off and the Speed Bonus if checked. Then player add the other bonus/malus of the game.&#10;&#10;When you write on a Solar Message, check the Clock which tracks the game length. Once a player has checked the 8th sun on their clock, the game ends !&#10;&#10;Add values for surrounded regions and any applicable speed bonuses and compare your scores.&#10;&#10;Inkalam comes with two solo variants.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In MadCash, players start with nothing but the shirts on their backs and race to accumulate wealth any way they can. There are several ways players can accumulate cash, including getting jobs and gambling, but the trick is getting it into their bank account before they lose it.&#10;&#10;The game board is a racetrack complete with a shortcut and spaces designed to create action or force decisions on every turn. Players use dice to move around the board and acquire Jobs (and a subsequent salary), receive Emails, collect cash payouts, and perform variety of other actions. Everyone starts by using dice and can use cash they collect to invest in other forms of transportation which allow them to strategically use up to 3 dice each roll, this also increases their job salary and the frequency at which they get paid.&#10;&#10;There is a deck of Email cards with corresponding email spaces on the board that subject the players to a variety of events good and bad including salary increases, bills, and cards with the power to hinder other players' progress. Once players collect cash, they try to land on an ATM space in order to deposit into their bank account. Until a player's cash is safely deposited into the bank, it is fair game and can be stolen by other players, or lost in several other ways.&#10;&#10;MadCash can be played individually or as teams with goal of accumulating a bank balance of $50,000. Game duration can vary greatly because of the volatility and unpredictability of the game play.&#10;&#10;The game is designed in the tradition of other financial race games like Monopoly and Parker Brothers Full House, but with more of a ruthless, backstabbing element with no player ever truly being out of the race until the game is over.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game proceeds mainly with card drafting; each player picks a card which they want to keep from their hand and reveals them together, then gives the remaining hand to the next player. Repeat this until last one card remains in the hand, which is discarded.&#10;&#10;After drafting cards is over, each player makes a juice mix from the cards they kept. The player sorts their card by type of fruit, and then loses the highest card from the highest value fruit set.&#10;&#10;Then players work out their total fruit mix value. If all the players have got a different total, the highest and lowest total players will lose milk (victory points). If some players have matching totals, those players lose milk instead.&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player has lost all their milk. The final score is the total from the last round, plus the value of milk retained. Most points wins with heavenly milk!&#10;&#10;Watch out for the cat cards. During the rounds, if a single cat appears, it steals fruit and the other players get no card.

This adventure pack contains everything needed for your Warriors to battle the Dark Elves of Naggaroth as they search for gold and treasure. Apart from any special rules in this book, all the normal set-up and game rules for Warhammer Quest also apply to Hall of the Hag Queen.&#10;&#10;Only a handful of brave adventurers will dare to explore the caverns lining the coasts of the Old World and even fewer would dare to set foot in a Black Ark. From the Sea of Claws to the Black Gulf, incursions from the Dark Elves of Naggaroth are frightening and frequent. And because of this, the area has become known as the &lsquo;Slavery Coast&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;In the Hall of the Hag Queen, the Warriors will delve into some of the most volatile areas of the Old World as they search for the hideout of a Dark Elf warband, even boarding their dark, cavernous vessel. They will be thwarted by treacherous passageways and perilous caves in addition to monstrous creatures and devilish traps. Trampling through the caverns of the Hag Queen might be a death sentence at best and an eternity of torture at worst. The Warriors may find themselves prisoners aboard a Black Ark heading back to the Land of Chill to die a slow death as slaves or they may be the victims of ritual sacrifice by the Witch Elves and their blood used to bathe in. But if fate is kind it is possible that they could overcome all obstacles to do something extraordinary; perhaps vanquishing the Hag Queen herself! Will fortune favour the foolish?&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;&#10;Hall of the Hag Queen 85 page Rulebook&#10;&#10;Floorplans:&#10;1 Objective Room (Temple of Khaine)&#10;1 Dungeon Room (Water Cave)&#10;2 Corridors (Landing, Bottomless Pit)&#10;&#10;Counters:&#10;3 Skull Counters&#10;3 Book Counters&#10;&#10;Playing Cards:&#10;4 Dungeon Cards&#10;27 Event Cards&#10;15 Treasure Cards&#10;4 Special Cards&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hunters is a cooperative miniatures tabletop game, set in the sci-fi multiverse of Star Breach. While Hunters is a standalone game, the rules for the game expand upon the core mechanics and settings of the Star Breach tabletop game ruleset. Thus, the Star Breach core rules will be often referenced throughout this expansion. The main difference between this expansion and the original game is that Hunters shifts the gaming action of Star Breach from &ldquo;player vs player&rdquo; to &ldquo;players vs game&rdquo; in a cooperative (co-op) environment. In this rulebook, you will find rules and mission based scenarios for solo play, co-op play up to four players, a campaign system, and a &ldquo;GM&rdquo; alternate mode where one of the players&mdash;or a 5th additional player&mdash;may play as the &ldquo;game master&rdquo; against their peers.&#10;&#10;As with Star Breach, Hunters is a free ruleset allowing players to creatively play with any sci-fi models and within any scifi setting of their choosing. The industry standard of 28-32mm height models and gaming accessories are recommended for play, but the game will do just as well in any other popular gaming scale (such as 15mm). However you choose to use this expansion and the contained rules, I hope you and your gaming group have an absolute blast doing so! Enjoy, and keep your eye on the stars!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

These tiles are worth 1-3 points as indicated by the number of locks on them. Place the included compass on the game board, and orient the board so that the compass points north. Place your ship on one of the starting locations and the phantom ship in the center of the 13x13 game board.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, reveal seven direction cards from the top of the deck. Players then take turns choosing a card and moving their ship in the indicated direction and distance, with most cards giving you choices for one or both of these values. If you finish your movement on a  treasure tile, flip it over to see whether the phantom ship moves; if it does, the phantom ship moves directly toward you, and if it reaches you before ending its movement, then you throw that treasure away instead of keeping it.&#10;&#10;Some tiles have you rotate the game board (and the compass), which means that the direction cards will now have you moving in different ways.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played, reveal seven new cards from the deck. After seven rounds or after all treasures have been claimed, players count their scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wagram 1809 is the first in a series of games designed to place an emphasis upon command at the individual formation level. Formations will be Corps in this game.&#10;&#10;The Formation Command system requires both players to make a series of difficult battlefield decisions, usually with insufficient resources available.&#10;This gets achieved through a unique Command system using Formation cards which will retain information about Cohesion (which affects Morale), Commands given and the readiness of Formations to fulfill actions required.&#10;If the wrong Commands are issued at the start of the turn, the player will not be able to 'change course' during the turn, but will have to live with the consequences.&#10;&#10;This will keep the map as clean and uncluttered as possible, because a lot of the action is going on &lsquo;off board&rsquo;. There will only be, at most, three counters per hex (excluding Leader)&ndash; maximum of 2 units plus a morale status marker.&#10;&#10;The activation sequence of formations will be determined by a chit draw mechanic, although players are able to make choices about which exact formation to activate in most cases.&#10;&#10;This, and the possibility for the passive player to conduct a range of five different reaction actions, lets both players be actively involved at all times.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
