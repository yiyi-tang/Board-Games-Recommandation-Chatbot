    "Description": "Panzertales: World Tank Division I (WTD I) is the one of a series of games oriented around the World Tank Museum series of miniatures.  Published in Japan and written in Japanese, the game involves area movement of tanks in the later days of the Second World War.&#10;&#10;The game includes 8 unpainted PVC tanks: two Panzer IV J, two Tiger I, two T-34/85, and two M4A1/76 Sherman.  However, as this is insufficient for most games, six sheets of cardboard counters are included with tanks and armored vehicles for Germany, America, Britain and the Soviet Union.  The cardboard chits represent a wide variety of armor including some less common units such as the American M26 Pershing and German Maus.&#10;&#10;Units have several characteristics, including attack strength, defense strength, movement allowance, anti-personnel strength and point value.  The single, double-sided map included in the game depicts Berlin on one side and Bastogne on the other.&#10;&#10;The game is not highly complex.  It is more a mechanism for players to use their World Tank Museum figures in a game.  It lacks several elements which were heavily involved in these and other armored engagements in this phase of the war, including infantry, anti-tank guns, artillery, and air power.&#10;&#10;",

You expand from your home planet, build ships and troops, send fleets out into space, battle for control of star systems.&#10;Several resources need to be balanced: population, energy, raw material, technology.&#10;&#10;The boardgame has some nice ideas. Once you've set your fleets in motion, they will remain on their course, no calling back. Distances between systems is given on a chart, so it will take your fleet between 1 and 3 rounds to reach its destination. No battle in outer space, only in a system. Combat is done by rolling dice (one per relevant unit) adding the points and dividing by 6. This is the damage done to the opponent, counted out in units.&#10;&#10;As pbm / pbem this game may have its merits. To convert a computer managed game to a board game was a bold plan, but one destined to fail. There is to much fiddly detail. Every system has its own little board and there are 42 of them. Plus one central board, plus one per player, all loaded with markers: how many resources, population, fighters, troops, docks ....&#10;&#10;It's a sensory overload. It may have succeeded on a smaller scale.&#10;&#10;",

For the rest of the game, each subsequent player declares a word that crosses at least one previous word, and everyone else must place the word on her grid such that it crosses at least one previous word.  Each time a player can't place a word, the game gets a strike.  Three strikes, and the game's over.&#10;&#10;In the introductory game, players simply earn a point for each letter of each word placed.  In the recommended Be Fruitful and Multiply variant, when you place a word, you multiply its length by the number of other letters it crossed.  This has the nasty side-effect of encouraging players to make their grid less suitable for more words, because the players strive to cross as many words as possible.&#10;&#10;Finally, Zero Tolerance, a cutthroat variant ideal for two players, proclaims that one strike ends the game.&#10;&#10;Download the instructions and game sheets to print and play!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a kind of chess game on the three-dimensional game board which has to be assembled from cardboard components before the first game. The winning condition is to either reach the highest square of the field (&quot;throne&quot;) with the king or to check-mate the opponent's king. Other player's pawns cannot be eliminated, though. Besides the king, the &quot;pawns&quot; are dice with different symbols. These change the movement rules (by turning a different side up) each time they are jumped over or jump over other pawns.&#10;&#10;",

Galaxias takes the basic principles of classic war games and modernizes them to fit the 20th century.&quot; &#10;Essentially 'Risk in Space': countries have become planets, continents are now galaxies, armies are squadrons. Controlling an entire galaxy entitles you to extra squadrons on your turn. Conquering a planet nets you a card with one of three symbols: A space shuttle, a ring-type space station, or a spaceship similar to the one from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Turning in a set of three gives you more squadrons. The squadrons are triangular craft beads that can be stacked.&#10;There are also 2 'Black Hole' cards, 1 'Death Ray', and 1 'Laser Shield'.&#10;Instead of a folding board, the universe is represented by a roll-up mat, which is stored in a cardboard tube, along with the cards and squadrons.&#10;There are four dice total: two each of two colors.&#10;The game was designed and manufactured in Tulsa, Oklahoma.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a one-of-a-kind prototype game designed specifically for the 2009 Gulf Games 23 Convention, held in Chattanooga, Tennessee, at the &quot;Chattanooga Choo-Choo&quot; Holiday Inn in the historic railroad station.&#10;&#10;The game is somewhat based on Rail Baron, the classic Avalon Hill game, but utilizing auctioning of rail lines on cards as the mechanic. Whereas Rail Baron has 28 rail lines represented, from the pre-mega-merger period (before about 1970), Chattanooga Choo-Choo II only has 27 of the same lines. Each line has it's own card, with cities served (see below) shown as well.&#10;&#10;Which one is missing? It is the Norfolk and Western, which on the Rail Baron board serves Norfolk, Cincinnati, and Columbus destinations. It is interesting that the present-day Norfolk Southern is one of the few &quot;Class 1&quot; super-major railroads coming out of the merger period, but the railroad it owes it's heritage to is the one missing in this game.&#10;&#10;Rail Baron has 67 destination cities on the board and in the payoff table. Chattanooga Choo-Choo II has only 25 of those cities included in the card deck. The destination cards show which rail lines serve that city. Cities cards are dealt to the players at the beginning. The object is to collect railroads (by bidding for them) such that at the end of the game, the player maximizes the connections with his cities.&#10;&#10;The cities chosen to be included are generally those larger hubs with multiple rail connections. Cities in Rail Baron that are only served by one or two railroads are eliminated in the Chattanooga Choo-Choo II deck. There are some interesting anomalies, however: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad is included, but neither Louisville nor Nashville cities are. Of course Chattanooga had to be included! But it seems strange that Portland Oregon, and Pittsburgh are not. Also missing is Dallas, the home of BGG.&#10;&#10;Game components consist of printed adhesive labels (&quot;Avery&quot; type) stuck on basic face cards, one blue and one red deck, and a set of simple plastic chips that act as currency for the bidding. There is also a one page printed rules sheet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game is loosely based on recent events that happen near the shores of Somalia were various ships were captured by pirates and were only released after multi-million ransoms were paid. In &quot;S&#197;&#130;ony okup&quot; players take on a role of managers of shady companies. On one hand they are hired by shipowners as negotiators trying to convince pirate groups to release hijacked tankers. On the other hand they are also in the pirate businesses themselves by controlling various bands that capture defenseless ships for ransom. But good days for these enterprises are coming to an end as more and more ships are taking longer routes avoiding dangerous Somalia's shores. Only if your company  will convince the public of being the most successful in freeing hijacked ships you can count on being chosen as ONZ official ship negotiator providing you with endless profit possibility. But beware, competition is not going to give up easily ... more and more ships are being captured.&#10;&#10;&quot;S&#197;&#130;ony okup&quot; is an bidding board game in which during a round one player takes on a role of Pirate and the other players roles of negotiators. Negotiators bid for the possibility to free the ship using sum of three resources available in the game: money, prestige points and troops (anti terrorists). Winner of the bidding round presents his offer to a Pirate. He can either accept the offer gaining all the money proposed (that later he or she can use to free ships from other players) or he can rise the price by using troops (acting as pirates this time). If ship is freed negotiator gets prestige points otherwise the ships stays on a board and becomes more valuable as the public pressure rises. Now the next player becomes a Pirate. The winner is a player with most prestige points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game won the contest for best prototype on Pionek (Polish board game convention)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A rummy-like word card game that was approved by the California Dept. of Education.&#10;&#10;The deck has 72 cards 68 cards with a letter and a value (2-9), and 4 jokers which act like wild cards.&#10;&#10;The basic game is Dealer's Choice: the dealer chooses how many to deal per player, and announces the winning condition, e.g. &quot;Make one word using all 5 cards&quot;, &quot;Make two words using all 7 cards&quot;, &quot;Make the name of a state&quot;, etc.  In a turn a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, and either goes out by revealing their hand with the winning condition, or discards 1 card.&#10;&#10;Usually each hand is a separate game, but one proposed scoring method is to concatenate the values of the first two cards, e.g. the letters D,O,R,S,W are worth 5, 7, 5, 2 &amp; 6, so &quot;SWORD&quot; scores 26, but &quot;WORDS&quot; scores 67.  (Jokers are treated like a 0.)&#10;&#10;Other games described include:&#10;&#10;Lions &amp; Tigers: Leave out Jokers, and deal 8-12 per player.  Players meld words during their turn, and may add letters to words on the table, rearranging them to make new words, and adding them to their own possessions.  Players may draw the top 3 of the discard pile.  A hand ends when a player empties their hand.  Players score for the length of their words on the table (5 letter word =&gt; 20 points, plus 20 more for letter over 5), and subtract 10 for each letter in hand.&#10;&#10;Solitaire: Lay 7 cards face up, make any words you can, replacing the vacated spaces.  Then deal cards in groups of 3, and use the top card to make words with the others and/or fill empty spaces.  Previous words can be expanded and/or combined together.&#10;&#10;Group Word-Formation: (suggested for ESL students)  Spread the cards face-up on a table, and ask the students to find letters for words in a particular subject, e.g. body parts, food, etc.&#10;&#10;Letter Recognition: (suggested for pre-schoolers)  Spread the cards on a table and have the child pick 3 letters and see if they make a word.  The parent can suggest letters to get, and can show what the word stands for when a word is spelled right.&#10;&#10;",

It is a word game only in a very limited sense: some of the headlines and captions span more than one tile, so you must assemble the phrases properly for the layout to make sense.&#10;&#10;The page is laid out on a game board with different regions providing different scores.  There are also methods for players to challenge one another, based on the filing times for stories, story shape, position and so forth.&#10;&#10;The game includes decks of City Desk cards, Wire Service cards and Clock cards (one for each hour from 10 AM to midnight).  The cards trigger events and bonus points.&#10;&#10;",

Further, a Global Administrative Map is also included that allows you to manage off-map movement.&#10;&#10;AOI also includes a full counter sheet (280 units) that features the Ethiopian order-of-battle, all the Italian and British forces that operated in East Africa, as well as a complete AETO upgrade that includes 40 new types of aircraft, such as the Me-163 Comet, the Mig-3, the PBY Catalina, and the Gloster Meteor. AOI also includes new rules specifically for AETO, such as: combat veterans, naval night movement, mountain pass movement, fire bombing, German Flak, Manstein and more.&#10;&#10;AOI also includes a map of Spain that adds additional Atlantic Ocean sea areas to AETO, and incorporates an entire Spanish Civil War scenario with a complete order-of-battle of Nationalist and Republican land, air and naval units. With AOI, AETO and APTO players can experience all of World War II. AOI has been designed to link with the AETO and APTO maps, or to be set-up alone as a scenario of the Ethiopian campaign.&#10;&#10;This is an expansion kit for Advanced European Theater of Operations and requires that game for play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The deck is modeled after the traditional card deck: there are 52 cards, with the suit and rank in the corner, along with a letter and the letter's value (1 to 15, rarer letters higher).  There are also 2 &quot;Intelex&quot; cards which act as jokers/wild cards.  Rules for 4 games are included:&#10;&#10;Word Rummy: Deal 10 each for 2 players, 7 each for 3-4, 6 each for 5-6.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, lays down words, adds letters to others' words, and discards 1.  The player who goes out scores the total of the letters' values in front of him; the others subtract the values of letters still in hand.&#10;&#10;Discovery: Hangman for 4 players.  Deal out the whole deck (without the Intelex cards).  Each player makes a word out of his cards and lays them face down in a row, with his word spelled in order among them.  In a turn, a player repeatedly asks 1 other player if they have a specific letter; if they do, they expose all copies of that letter they have.  The turn ends when a request fails.  During a turn one may also guess what a word is: if wrong, he loses 5 point; if right, he gets the word's score and the guess-ee is out for the hand, which ends when all words are discovered.  One may bluff and have no word; if that is correctly the guesser gets 20 points.&#10;&#10;Solitaire: Like Klondike.  Deal out 7 stacks of cards, of heights 1, 2 ... 7, the top card of each face up.  Move cards around to form words and word fragments, removing words as they are formed, exposing face-down cards as revealed, filling blank spots with letters or fragments.  Then go through the deck 3 cards at a time, combining letters as before.  The goal is to use up the whole deck.&#10;&#10;Poker: For 2 to 7.  Deal 5 per player.  Each in turn may exchange any or all of their cards for an equal number from the deck, and make their best word.  Highest-scoring word wins.  (Betting and bluffing are mentioned as on option &quot;for added excitement&quot;.)&#10;&#10;",

In a turn, a player: draws 1 card from the draw or discard pile; plays one meld from the hand or adds to a meld on the table; and discards one.&#10;&#10;Melds can be 3+ of the same letter; a straight of 3+ letters in a row; or a word of 2+ letters of the same color (unless there are 2+ of the same letter in the word).  Adding to a meld can extend the set or straight, or change its type (straight ABC + S to word CABS), or even flip them to the other color and letters.&#10;&#10;The round ends when a player empties his hand after discarding.  He get the total of the numbers on all cards in hand of all opponents.  Each player with a meld of 5+ cards gets 50 points bonus.  Game is 500 points.&#10;&#10;Siamese Word Rummy:&#10;&#10;With 2 people, deal 7 cards each and 7 cards in a face-up column; with 3-4, 6 each and a column of 6.  In a turn a player draws 1, melds or adds to a meld (or passes), and discards.&#10;&#10;Melds are words only, and must include all the cards in any one row on the table.  Words must be 3+ letters of the same color, unless there are duplicate letters.  The player immediately scores: if a new word, all the cards' points; if a rearranged word, all the cards' points + 25 bonus; if an extended word that preserves the root (plural, past tense, -ING), only the points on the added letters.&#10;&#10;As before, the player who empties his hand gets a bonus of 50 points plus the total of the cards in the others' hands; game is 500 points.&#10;&#10;The earliest version of this game used the Hebrew alphabet, in celebration of the new nation of Israel.&#10;&#10;",

If the space you are claiming is one unclaimed short space away from two of your claimed spaces (in other words, in the middle space), you get to claim both intervening spaces.&#10;&#10;",

You will need to master them to defeat your opponent, a god just as powerful and determined to rule as you.  Whether you incarnate directly on the battlefield as a hero or bombard your enemy from afar with devastating incantations, you will need wits as well as strength to survive.&#10;&#10;Bless your warriors, summon allies, and commit your forces wisely in the ultimate contest of skill and intellect.  In Devacurse there can be no middle ground.&#10;&#10;The winner will inherit a universe; the loser, cold oblivion.&#10;&#10;Background:&#10;&#10;Devacurse was born from the imagination of Dr. Eiamchan Srithanon and his design team, the 6 Devabrothers:  SrithaNa Eiamchan and Mr. Korn (rules team and card designers), Sarit Chareonpanichkul (art director and trophy model sculptor) and Veerawat Jangpetch (art director), Saranyu (story director and character designer), and Srichai Eiamchan (production).  SrithaNa, Korn, Veerawat, and Saranyu were still studying architecture at King Mongkut&rsquo;s University of Technology Thonburi (KMIT) at the time, and art director Sarit was brought in from outside to complete the team.  Dr. Srithanon and his friends had been avid card gamers for years, but after seeing fellow Thais playing endless Western and Japanese imports, they decided it was time to create a distinctively Thai collectable card game.  Their goal was amibitious - Dr. Eiamchan and his team wanted to create a card game that didn&rsquo;t just feature Thai themes or look Thai, but one whose game mechanics embodied Thai style.  Two years of development and playtesting followed, and in 2007 Devacurse came on the market with an initial base set release, Half Blood Deal.  This was followed in 2008 with the first expansion set, Vengeful Kindred.&#10;&#10;Devacurse immediately impressed Thai players with its high production values, elegant design, and lavish artwork, with many comparing its high level of presentation to that of Wizards of the Coast&rsquo;s Magic the Gathering.  Currently Devacurse commissions work from over 30 professional artists in Thailand.  Once players learned the rules, they were impressed again by supple game mechanics that rewarded tactical planning and captured the essence of Thai culture.  Specifically, the game strongly recalls the fantastical world of the Thai Ramayana painted on the walls of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, in the Royal Palace complex in Bangkok.  It also subtly incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist prayer and Samsara, the cycle of reincarnation, into the structure of play.&#10;&#10;The Devacurse card layout incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist and Hindu cosmology.&#10;&#10;Devacurse is a sophisticated and still-evolving piece of genuinely Thai pop culture in a country that is often swamped by Western and Japanese influence, imports, and imitations.  Dr. Srithanon and his team are committed to bringing the legends of their heritage to life in the game, and the results so far have been unique and beguiling.&#10;&#10;Devacurse is currently published only in Thai, and has therefore been limited to Thai audiences.  This website aims to open up the world of Devacurse to English-speaking gamers and enthusiasts of Thai culture and Southeast Asian myth.  In the coming weeks and months I will be putting up a complete English translation of the Devacurse rulebook, followed by English translations of all of the current Devacurse cards (Half Blood Deal through Vengeful Kindred).  There will be an in-depth review of the game, and other articles on a variety of subjects (card spotlight, deck design, strategy, back story) will hopefully follow.&#10;&#10;If all goes well, determined English speakers should be able to play and enjoy the Thai edition of Devacurse with the information posted on this website, until such a time as Devacurse is published in English.&#10;&#10;Enjoy, and welcome to the epic world of Devacurse.&#10;............&#10;&#10;more ....&#10;&#10;http://devacurseinenglish.wordpress.com  (English)&#10;&#10;http:// www.devacurse.com  (Thai)&#10;&#10;",

After the first word, all subsequent words must intersect with previous words in a crossword fashion, using at least one previous letter in making a new word.  Typical crossword rules apply: any adjacent letters must form a word.  Words must be at least 2 letters, and no more than 4 cards may be played in a turn.&#10;&#10;The hand ends when a player runs out of cards; players then add the sum of points of cards in the hand to their running total.  When a player reaches 100, the game ends and the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;There is also a solitaire game described.  Deal 12 piles of 3, with the top card face up (leave out the Jokers).  Make words out of the exposed cards, and discard them, revealing lower cards when exposed.  The turn up the remainder of the deck 3 cards at a time, making new words as before including the new card shown.  If all the table cards are gone, then spread the rest of the cards face up and continue.  When stuck, add the value of the unused cards.  15 or lower is excellent.&#10;&#10;",

Discard cards by forming words from the top cards of the piles -- but you can use a lower card if the card(s) above it are also used in the same word.  When you've done all you can, take the remaining cards and turn them up in 3s, using them to make more words with the rest.  You can go through the deck as often as you want.

    "Description": "This is one of many competing crossword card games of the late 1930s.  Fairchild had two versions: Lingo used bridge-size cards, and Patch Word had small cards to more easily fit on the table.  The deck has 54 cards consisting of 2 jokers and 52 letter cards.&#10;&#10;The rules for the Cross Word game: Deal 11 each for 2-3 players, 9  for 4-5, 7 for 6 or more.  Each player lays down a word in their turn, using no more than 4 cards, and adding to the growing crossword arrangement.  If they cannot play a word, they discard 1 and draw 1 from the draw or discard pile.  The hand ends when a player goes out of cards, and players add the values of their cards in hand to their total; commoner cards have higher values.  When a player reaches 100 total points, the low score wins.&#10;&#10;The Lingo version had rules for 3 other games:&#10;&#10;Lingo-Anagram: For 2-4 players.  Deal 10 each.  In a turn, a player either lays down a word of 3+ letters, or adds letters to an existing word to make new words, or does neither; the turn ends by discarding 1 and drawing 1 card.  Adding simple endings (-S, -ES, -ED) is prohibited.  The hand ends and the game scored as in the cross word game.&#10;&#10;Scrambled-Lingo: Have all agree on a length of word to make.  Spread all the cards on the table, and players draw that number of cards for a particular word.  Then they scramble its order and pass it to the left.  Players announce when they have unscrambled the word and lay it down.  The order of correct unscrambling is the order of winning.&#10;&#10;Lingo-Solitaire: Take the cards that make your full name, or a short phrase.  See how many ways you can rearrange all the letters to make a phrase that makes sense.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A crossword card game of the late 1930s, that also includes rules for several other games, a few of which were not seen in its competitors. The deck has 54 cards: 2 &quot;Sub&quot; cards which act as wild cards, and 52 cards with a letter and its value on each. Rules for 8 games are included:&#10;&#10;1. Crossword Game: Deal 10 each to 2-4, 7 each to 5-7 players.  In each turn, a player lays a word from his hand to the table in a crossword fashion, the first word alone, other words intersecting the growing array.  If unable to play, a player discards 1 and draws 1 from the draw or discard pile. A hand ends when a player goes out; players add their hands' value to their scores; when a player reaches 100 the low total wins.&#10;&#10;2. Word Solitaire: Lay all the cards face up in 3s, fanned so as to see all the letters.  Make and discard words from the topmost cards, though if a card is used in a word the letter just underneath it can also be used.  You win if you use all the cards.&#10;&#10;3. Letter Patience: Like Klondike, deal 7 piles of heights 1-7, and turn up the top card of each.  Make and discard cards, exposing the new tops of each pile; empty spaces may be filled in with vowels.  Turn up the remainder of the deck one by one, and use the top letter of this pile with the others to make words.  You win if you use all the cards.&#10;&#10;4. Crossword Solitaire A: Deal out 6 cards face up.  Use these cards to build a crossword array, one word at a time, filling empty spaces in the 6 from the remaining deck.  Then turn up that deck one at a time and continue -- you can only use the top of the turn-up pile.&#10;&#10;5. Crossword Solitaire B: Similar to A, but start with a hand of 12 cards, which is not replenished; the deck is still gone through once, one card at a time.&#10;&#10;6.  Anagrams: For 1-6 players.  Everyone is dealt one card.  In a turn, a player either: places his card in the center of the table; makes a word with that card and other cards in the center, placing the word in front of him; or adds the letter to an existing word, rearranging letters to make a new word, and taking the word if it belonged to someone else.  After the deck has been gone through, the player with the most points in front of him wins.&#10;&#10;7.  The O-U-T Game: For 4-8 players.  All the cards are dealt face up.  In a turn a player places one card in the middle of the table, while thinking of a word of at least 9 letters that starts with all the letters placed so far.  Once such a word is finished, the player who does it gets a letter (O, U or T), the word is discarded and the process starts again.  On getting all of OUT, a player is out of the game.  A player may pass if they think they don't have a letter to add to the growing word; if someone else points out a letter and word he could do, he earns an E for excellence, which can cancel out one other letter.  Players may challenge a play that doesn't seem to lead to any word; whoever is wrong earns a penalty letter.&#10;&#10;8. Guess-O-Gram: A type of hangman for any number of players.  One becomes the Thinker, thinks of a word, and lays it face down in order.  Other take turns guessing letters; if a letter is in the word it is revealed and the guesser earns 2 points per letter.  A player who guess the whole word or the last letter gets 2 points times the length of the word.  Play to an agreed number of rounds.&#10;&#10;",

The word is scored as follows:&#10;&#10;2 letter words = 4 points&#10;3 letter words = 9 points&#10;4 letter words = 16 points&#10;5 letter words = 25 points&#10;6 letter words = 36 points&#10;[etc.]&#10;&#10;The second player rolls the dice (or die) and begins their word with a letter in the corresponding square.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot make a word of at least two letters, they pass, and their score for that round is zero.&#10;&#10;The person with the most points after 10 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;Created by indigopotter for Reprint&#039;s contest, February 2009.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You will need:&#10;&#10;A 6-sided die&#10;Paper and pencil&#10;An egg timer/sand timer&#10;A token for each player (optional)&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;&#10;Each player gets a pair of the tiles. Player one places one in front of them, and rolls the die. The die roll tells them which letter will be in play this game. 1 = top letter, 2 = second letter down, and so on. (Optional: Place a coin or token next to this letter to mark it, or write it on your paper.)&#10;&#10;Player one sets the second tile down to the left of the first. They roll the die again, and the letter from the second tile is chosen as with the first. Player one then takes the second tile and overlaps the first, so that the two active letters are side by side.&#10;&#10;Player two determines their active letters the same way. The timer is started, and players list as many words as possible that start with the left letter and end with the right.&#10;&#10;When time runs out, the player with more words scores the difference in the number of words between the two players.&#10;&#10;If player one makes 10 words and player two makes 7, player one scores 3 points.&#10;&#10;For the next round, each player must rotate a tile, change the order of the tiles, or perform any combination of the two.&#10;&#10;First player to 20 points wins.&#10;&#10;To increase the intensity, increase the required number of letters per word to 4, 5, or 6.&#10;&#10;Created by indigopotter for Reprint&#039;s contest, February 2009.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bagua is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. Each player controls 2 pieces and tries to race one of his piece to the opposite of the board, while avoiding being captured.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;On each turn, a player must move one, and only one of his pieces.&#10;&#10;A move consists of holding one square still, while rotating the other square to a row that is at least one space forward.&#10;&#10;Capturing occurs, when two squares of the same color come into contact. If the color is black, player one (black player) gets to remove the opposing piece, and vice-versa. If the two pieces belong to the same player, the player has the option of removing one or none of his two pieces.&#10;&#10;The objective is to be the first player to move one of your pieces across to the opposite edge. (You only need one square to touch the opposite side.)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Placement rules are just like Blokus. Every new piece must touch your existing piece diagonally, and diagonally only. They can touch, or not touch, opponent piece in any manner as long as there are no overlaps.&#10;&#10;One player gets the two L pieces, the other the T and the S. Again, like in Blokus, players start from opposite corners. However, unlike Blokus, once a player has placed his two pieces down, he will replace the piece that was not the one last played. The replaced piece must be moved into a different position.&#10;&#10;Scoring occurs as follows. For every square of any opponent piece that the newly replaced piece touches, the player scores one point. (For example, if the green player just played the T, he scores two points.)&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has reached 40 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two kingdoms are at war. The side who fights at the right place at the right time will emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;phase one: military strategist advices&#10;On each turn, each player rolls his die and secretly looks at it before covering it up with the cup.&#10;&#10;phase two: feints and combat&#10;Players then take turns playing cards into one of the 6 areas on the board. Each area can take a maximum of 3 values. Players may pass. If they do so, they cannot play any more card/s for the rest of that turn.&#10;&#10;phase three: resolution&#10;After both players are done playing their cards, their strategical strength is determined. An area on the board is in play if the corresponding number is rolled by either player. Any cards played into an in-play area grants the player strategical strength: one times the number of the area for each 1-card played, and two times the number of the area for each 2-card played.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the higher strategical strength wins the turn, and gets victory tokens from the opponent's pool. The number of tokens won/lost is equal to one plus the total value of the cards played by the losing player. (So on each turn the possible numbers of victory points won/lost are 1, 2, 3 and 4.)&#10;&#10;victory&#10;When one side runs out of victory tokens, he loses. The other player wins.&#10;&#10;",
