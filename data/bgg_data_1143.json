    "Description": "Welcome to Motley West, fellas! I&rsquo;m the sheriff, but gosh, I think I&rsquo;m getting old for this job. I need a deputy to help me fetch the desperados. You need to be quick and good, and ready to face many a trigger-happy bandit. Only the best of you will replace me as a new sheriff.&#10;&#10;Motley West is a speed action and short-term memory game with a mix of two shapes and three colors. The deck includes two types of cards:&#10;&#10;&bull; Bounty cards: Showing Cowboy hat with certain color or Scarf with certain color.&#10;&bull; Outlaw cards: Every outlaw wears cowboy hat and scarf. Some of them have shotgun.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Shuffle all cards and distribute evenly to all players. All players hold their deck face down in front of them. Distribute 3 life tokens to everybody.&#10;     Place the Sheriff badge  on the middle of the table. &#10;     Each player reveals their card and hide the revealed card with their hand turn by turn.&#10;     When a player thinks there are Bounty card and Corresponding Outlaw card among the top of each player's revealed card, hit the Sheriff badge. If they find the right 2 persons who have the matching cards, take those 2 cards as points.&#10;     Some outlaws have a gun, and catching them won&rsquo;t be that easy. You cannot arrest an armed Outlaw even if their hat or scarf matches the Bounty Card. To arrest an armed Outlaw, you need to find the Bounty Card that displays a gun. If, by mistake, you point to a normal Bounty Card and an armed Outlaw, then you discard one Fame Token.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once all players have played all of their cards, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Tally your points as follows:&#10;Bounty Cards (2 points for a 2,000$ reward ; 3 points for a 3,000$ reward ; etc.)&#10;Outlaw Cards (1 point each)&#10;Fame Tokens (2 points each)&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins and becomes the new Sheriff in town.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Union player must assault and capture the imposing Stockade Redan earthworks that overlook Graveyard Road leading into Vicksburg (unquestionably the most defensible position encompassing the city). The Confederate player must defend the Redan against the two historical assaults that attempted to take it (both failed with heavy casualties to the Union). Capturing the Redan does not automatically assure a Union victory. If and when the first or second Union assault succeeds, the players must then consult the Gettysburg Matrix to determine if the impending collapse of Vicksburg will prevent Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s invasion of the North by compelling Jefferson Davis (who viewed Vicksburg as critical to the South&rsquo;s survival) to refuse Lee&rsquo;s risky plan to invade Pennsylvania, changing the course of the war. Scale: Each game turn is equal to 5 to 10 minutes of real time. Each hex represents 12.5 yards (22.8 meters).

    "Description": "While traveling through the remotest part of the Himalayan Mountains, Michael Cullen and Ian Carson were introduced to a game of chance and strategy that has been played down through the ages by those rugged souls that inhabit a region where few would survive.&#10;&#10;It is with great pride and reverence that we bring back this jewel for you and yours to enjoy.  A true game of strategy that will add excitement to any festive gathering.&#10;&#10;The game of 63 has its origins in Bhutan, the Land of the Thunder Dragon.  This ancient kingdom, nestled between Tibet, India and Nepal, is a place out of time where traditional life thrives in the shadow of the world's greatest mountain range.  Deep in the isolated Himalayan Mountains, it is not uncommon for the mountain village men to huddle together to play this game.&#10;&#10;They mark out 63 spots using twigs forming a roughly circular playing area.  Each player gathers their own set of distinctive tokens from what's available around them.  They use blades of grass, plant stems, stones and sticks of different sizes and anything else they can easily find.&#10;&#10;The dice are made from yak bone.  Each player takes their turn, shaking the dice in a small hardened leather bowl and slamming it down in the centre of the board.  The game is played with great enthusiasm and often the outcomes are gambled on.  It is a timeless game of opportunity, luck, and strategy from one of the last timeless places left on Earth.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The map starts with multiple lines already built, and you must try to beat the Underground's score.&#10;&#10;Much like the engineering crews of the London Underground, you must be quite resourceful at building track, and at the same time divert passengers to use your own lines, rather than the official ones.&#10;&#10;If you can beat the Underground at its own game before the Destination cards run out, you win The Underground Challenge!&#10;&#10;Each turn:&#10;&#10;     Take four actions - with each being placing Track tokens or taking Branch tiles, as in normal gameplay.&#10;     Perform Passenger movement.&#10;     Perform Passenger movement again.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Passenger will thus visit one or two stations, and the Destination cards matching those stations will be removed and replaced as in normal gameplay.&#10;&#10;The Passenger then will visit another one or two stations, with the destination cards matching those stations also being removed and replaced.&#10;&#10;Passenger movement rules are the same as in the game for multiple players, with the following exception:&#10;If a Passenger movement is up to the player&rsquo;s choice (due to an equal number of empty spaces and lines involved in each potential route), the player must choose the route that gives the Underground the most points.&#10;&#10;If all potential routes would give the Underground and the player equal points, the player may choose any one of those lines.&#10;&#10;If your Score tile reaches or overtakes the Underground&rsquo;s tile, the game is over, and you have successfully completed The Underground Challenge!&#10;&#10;",

A win is worth three points, a draw worth one point and loss gets you nothing. At the end of the league, the player with the most points will be crowned as the champion.&#10;&#10;In a match, both players will put forward a squad of four of their players from each of the positions. With three attacks each, it's up to each player to pass, punt, dribble, cross and ultimately shoot or head the ball past the opposing player's goalkeeper with their attacker, decided by stat-to-stat comparisons aided by the roll of six-sided die. Win the clash to move the ball forward, but lose and your attack will be ended by a block, tackle or save and the ball given to the other player.&#10;&#10;Outside of matches, pick up event cards to alter the landscape of the game both inside and outside of matches - sometimes in your favour, sometimes not - and patch up weaknesses in your team makeup by transferring new players in.&#10;&#10;Beware, to finish at the top of the league it'll take talent and luck!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deliverance From Beyond the Stars! is a strategic game in Galaxy-Foundation Games' strategic Battle for Andromeda: Conflict for a Trillion Suns! series. It uses the series rulebook, Andromeda Foundation Official Battle Manual.&#10;&#10;This game pits the Alliance System of Federated Worlds aka the United Systems of the Alliance Federation, along with their allies the Confederation of Thetan Republics, against the invading N'Dridd, which apparently are some kind of hive race. The rulebook claims that rules are provided to allow the former side to be split between an Alliance player and a Thetan player, but such rules do not actually appear.&#10;&#10;The game-specific rulebook has lots of background material on the civilzations involved and their ships, plus rules for special units. It also devotes a lot of space to the special feature of this game in the series, which is that the N'Dridd player starts the game by randomly drawing numbered chits which determine their force composition and deployment. The players get points for accomplishing things and partway through the game is halted to assess points scored and current forces vis-a-vis the N'Dridd's starting chits; this determines what additional forces the N'Dridd gets for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):&#10;&#10;&#10;        The game posits 6 Variable Options selected by the N'DRIDD player drawing &quot;chits&quot; (counters with numerical designations on them), the Federation &ldquo;0B&quot; is the same for all but each Chit dictates a specific quantity of N'Dridd &quot;At Start Forces&quot; and a potential follow-up of indeterminate size. The Alliance Player does not know whether to mass his ships in a broad &quot;spread&quot; to stop any small N'Dridd Scout Group and DESTROY IT before it can escape with Data that might &quot;trigger&quot; a huge Task Force or even a Horde. Then again, spreading them out may leave them dangerously exposed if the attack group is NOT a Scout Force but a Task Force that will devastate the Culture.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Eighteen prototypes were developed, a vote was taken, and two promotional cards were selected from among the top vote-getters.&#10;&#10;Card #1 (suggested by Luis Mendes): Lady Mary Shelton is a stunning and eligible prestige guest who permits players to add an additional male guest to any activity that she attends.&#10;&#10;Card #2 (suggested by James Cartwright): Aston Webb is a renowned architect who permits players to acquire an improvement from the marketplace at no charge.&#10;&#10;Note: There were two errata in player aids from the base game. Instead of an online print file correction, the publisher decided to reprint those two players aids (4 copies of each). As the publisher was firing up the card template, they decided to have a little contest where they would 'apologize' for the error by letting backers develop their own cards. These were the two contest winning cards.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It's fun, mildly addictive,  and almost too easy to learn.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;The game consists of 162 cards and an 8-page rulebook:&#10;&#10;- 55 Attack cards&#10;    - 55 Counter cards&#10;    - 42 Injury cards&#10;    - 10 Special cards&#10;&#10;How does Pass-a-Fist work?:&#10;How does a typical, figurative fist fight play out, you ask? Keep scrolling and we'll lay it all out!&#10;&#10;To start, shuffle and divide the Fight cards and Injury cards into two separate piles. Players will draw from each throughout the game. Next, deal 5 Fight cards to each player.&#10;&#10;To begin a turn (or, &quot;round&quot;) - a player draws a Fight card, and then plays an Attack card on another player:&#10;&#10;If at any point an Attack card lands on a player, that player can play a Counter card to stop it, or redirect it:&#10;&#10;What about those fancy sounding Special cards we mentioned earlier? Those can be played at any time, and they allow players to do... well... special stuff:&#10;&#10;If an Attack card lands on a player, and they don't play a Counter card, they place an Injury card face up in front of them:&#10;&#10;Once a player has received three (valid) Injury cards, they're out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last person standing wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;Pass-a-Fist is a great time for anyone ages 12 and up (as long as you're okay with cartoonish violence, that is). The game has been very well received by a wide range of people, young and old, who've had a chance to play it. Turns out, everyone likes a pretend fight, especially if it results in some seriously good laughs.&#10;&#10;The game is incredibly easy to learn, and only takes about 2 minutes to figure out. There's no mastering it, though - every new round brings about a different style of chaos. No two games are ever alike (...it's not even close).&#10;&#10;The game plays pretty quickly (10-15 minutes) with a small group (4 players), or a bit longer (20-25 minutes) with larger groups (8-10 players). Easy game play and rules make it pretty adaptable to most groups, too. Play it with kids! Play it as a drinking game! Play it regularly and demand future expansions!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each piece is placed on a white dot. Your task is to reunite your pieces into one stack. The first one to do so wins. Players start out with six numbered pieces; one (1), two (2), and three (3). The numbers on the pieces indicate the number of spaces (dots) a piece can travel. Pieces can pass over their own or their opponent&rsquo;s pieces, but cannot land on a dot occupied by an opponent, only their own. When a player lands on their own piece it is combined into a stack with the top piece number representing the number of moves that stack can travel. Players can have multiple stacks that they create as they are striving for their single stack. This simple and easy to learn game will surprise you on how fun it is to discover the complexity of moves and strategies that will keep this game fresh and challenging.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each target city has attributes and you want to select businesses that align up the most with your target city, while ensuring that each business will fit properly.&#10;&#10;GAME OBJECTIVE:&#10;Maximize your cities value while minimizing it's footprint&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Each round players will take turns selecting businesses to include in your new city.  Players can continue to acquire businesses as long as they want, but at a risk of adding a larger city footprint (land usage size).  At the end of each round, players need to match up businesses next to each other based upon which businesses can be placed next to each other (aka matching icons).  At the end of the third round, players will score up their city, bonuses, and city costs to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Legend has it that a long time ago, mankind was ignorant to the extent of not knowing how to count or tell the years apart. The ever-benevolent Jade Emperor wanted to help mankind out. From there, the idea of a twelve-year cycle and the naming of each year in the cycle after an animal was born.&#10;&#10;But how should the Jade Emperor choose twelve animals from among so many in the living world, while remaining impartial? To resolve this equitably, the Jade Emperor decided to hold a race involving all animals on his birthday. The first twelve animals to cross the river and reach the Heavenly Palace will have a year named after them, in the order of how they finished the race. The race became known as The Great Race and the twelve-year cycle was named the Chinese Zodiac.&#10;&#10;Race for the Chinese Zodiac is a board game that recreates The Great Race. Each player has a hand of eight action cards (numbered 1-8) as well as energy cards of different values and karma tokens. Each player selects one animal token and takes the corresponding animal card, which grants the player advantages during the race. All players place their animal token on the start space of the racetrack. Players assemble the dual-layered and double-sided action wheel that's used to determine the effectiveness of each action and place it in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, all players select an action card and an energy card from their hand, then they reveal these cards simultaneously. If the action card selected is one value lower than the player's previously played action card, the player must spend one karma token; if two or more values lower, they must spend two karma tokens. Players then resolve all played actions based on the orientation of the wheel, ideally gaining movement, new energy cards, and karma. Everyone places their played cards face up in front of themselves, then rotate the wheel clockwise by one space and start a new turn.&#10;&#10;The first animal to complete the race earns the coveted right of having the first year of the Chinese Zodiac named after it!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a skirmish game for two small forces, each consisting of 1 to 4 sub-units, each in turn of 4 to 12 singly based 25mm figures, totalling up to 24 army points (AP) and controlled by a single player. Figures vary in cost between 6 AP and 2 AP. One figure of the most expensive mounted type or most expensive foot type present is nominated as the force's commander and one figure of each group is nominated as its leader.&#10;&#10;Current skirmish rules split play into very small increments and use simultaneous movement requiring written orders. We split play into alternate bounds, each of which simulates the time needed by a warrior to observe, appreciate his situation, decide if he needs to continue a current action or to do something different and then do it, or to exchange blows with or shoot at an opponent. This is about 5 seconds.&#10;&#10;As all men are not similarly quick thinking or quick to react, we randomly limit the number of figures that can shoot or be moved each bound, but not the exchange of blows by figures already in physical contact. Since complex group actions require orders that cannot be passed and obeyed in 5 seconds, they are made more difficult to achieve and are assumed to have been initiated during the previous bounds.&#10;&#10;We distinguish between fatal and disabling wounds, but do not take account of wounds unlikely to affect combat in the short term, or distinguish the fates of men from those of their mounts. The winning side recovers its disabled. Those of the losers are assumed to be slain in the pursuit, except for knights who are ransomed.&#10;&#10;Despite its simplicity, the resulting system is much more subtle than may be immediately apparent. The average player has memorised the battle rules part way through his first game, but tactical skill takes longer to develop. A game usually lasts less than an hour.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Some game modes only use one type, others use a mixture of both.&#10;&#10;In multiplayer mode, the goal of each round is to add as many pieces as possible to a single 36-tile hexagon. The game is played with two sets of tiles (included in the game) and players take turns to add tiles to the single hexagon in the middle of the table. Plays like blocking players, choosing the right number of new tiles or reducing your play time to pressure other players make this game fast, fun but most of all strategic.  The person who lays the most tiles, wins the round.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Brytenwalda, a ruleset which will allow you to recreate battles and raids during the so called British &ldquo;Age of Arthur&rdquo; and Saxon invasion. In Brytenwalda you'll impersonate a Chieftain during the Dark Ages, commanding his men in the defence of their homelands or looting and burning those belonging to your enemies.&#10;&#10;There were many battles during the Dark Ages (specially in the British islands), but the armies used to be surprisingly small. The laws of King Ine who reigned between the 7th and 8th century provide a good frame of reference. A group of seven ravaging men are regarded as thieves, from seven to thirty-five is called a band and any any group larger than this is regarded as an army. Usually, an invading army arrived in just two or three ships, and even kings could be seen commanding armies no larger than three football teams.&#10;&#10;Although the Dark Ages were an extremely violent era with a great number of battles and raids, but only a few were detailed in the chronicles, such as decisive pitch battles or those in which an important person died. Brytenwalda is focused on these kinds of battles which the modern wargamer would call a &ldquo;skirmish&rdquo;. While you wont be able to re-enact the Battle of Hastings in Brytenwalda, you'll have plenty of fun leading a band of Scot-Irish pirates, a group of raiding Saxons or a unit of Romano-British pedites patrolling the frontier.&#10;&#10;Grab your lucky dice, gather your men, and get ready for battle!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

If, after initial placement no one is winning, then each player takes turn moving their pieces along any lines. This creates quite a bit of strategy as each player must strike a balance between trying to get their 4 in a row, or stopping their opponent from doing so.&#10;&#10;Quick and easy to setup and play, the game is suitable for anyone ages 7 or older.

    "Description": "You&rsquo;re smart, you&rsquo;re resourceful, and at times you&rsquo;re shrewd. Your kind is the second most successful creature on this planet next to humans. To some you&rsquo;re a dinner item waiting to be grasped in hungry teeth and claws, to others you&rsquo;re a vermin, a harborer of plagues, a pest to be exterminated, but you&rsquo;re much more, you&rsquo;re a survivor. Survival can come at a high cost, even it means disposing of your fellow rats so that you can be the last rat standing, or crawling.&#10;&#10;Contents: 20&rdquo; x 20&rdquo; neoprene board / 6 rat pieces / 120 plumbing tiles / 64 two sided trap pieces / 2 eight sided dies&#10;&#10;Number of players: 2 &ndash; 6 rats can play this deadly game individually, or teams of 2 players or 3 players can be formed.&#10;&#10;Objective: To be the last rat left on the board. When a rat is unable to move on its turn it is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Setup: All the players work together placing the plumbing tiles onto the board until all 64 white squares are filled up. After all the pipe tiles have been placed on the board players place their rat piece anywhere on the board that has a white dot in the plumbing. Players take turns going clockwise.&#10;&#10;Plumbing Tiles: There are a total of 120 plumbing tiles. Only 64 of the 120 tiles are needed to fill in all the white squares. The tiles can be rotated to fit other pipes.&#10;&#10;Players select and place the tiles on the board in any arrangement they want, but all the pipe ends must be connected to another pipe end except for the 16 pipes that end in a circle. There are 32 toilets that must be connected to a pipe. Players take turns placing one tile at a time until all 64 spaces are filled. It is possible not to have piping in every space and 3 blank tiles without pipes are provided to fill in those squares. If the pipes don&rsquo;t fit at the end players can rearrange them as a group to make them fit.&#10;&#10;Toilets: Printed on the board are 32 toilets outside of the white squares. Each toilet has a number in it and these numbers are used to reference the placement of traps when the dice are rolled. A player can travel from one end of the board to the other through toilets. Traveling can only take place if there is not another rat or a trap next to the toilet. Traveling is always at the exact opposite end of the board on the same row from which a rat enters a toilet. Traps cannot be moved through a toilet.&#10;&#10;Black Traps: Everytime the dice are rolled traps are placed on the board. Rats can never move onto or go across a trap. The two dice are rolled on each rat&rsquo;s turn. The two numbers on the dice determine the placement of the traps. There is a green die and a yellow die that correspond with the green and yellow toilets. So if you were to roll a yellow 5 and a green 2 then you would go to the yellow 5 toilet and move across until you line up with the green 2 toilet. Where those two numbers meet is where you would place a black trap. Then you would flip the numbers, yellow 2 and green 5 to place the second black trap. If a rat rolls double then only a red trap is laid. If a trap lands on a rat then the rat moves to another location. The rat can only move in a straight line from where it is being displaced. Black traps can be moved by any rat on their turn. Black traps can only be moved one space at a time in one turn.&#10;&#10;Red Traps: Red traps are created when any two black traps are combined. This combining can be done when a black trap is placed on top of another black trap from the roll of the dice or when a rat moves one black trap onto another. Red traps can never be moved. They are permanent. No black traps can be put on top of a red trap. Like the black trap rats can never land on or go over a red trap.&#10;&#10;Moving: Rats can travel more than one space at a time in a turn as long as it is in a straight line and not blocked by a trap. They can make a turn on their next turn. They can squeeze past another rat on their path, but cannot land in the same space of another rat. Rats can never land on or cross over a trap. Rats can hop in a toilet and travel to the other end (row), but only if it is not occupied by another rat or trap. They can only pop in on the first square at the opposite end. A rat must be able to move in their turn, or they are eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;Moving Traps: A rat can choose to move a trap in place of moving plumbling tiles. There are different reasons why a rat may do this. One reason would be to clear a path for it to travel, another would be to try to trap another rat. If a rat moves a black trap onto another black trap it becomes a red trap which is permanent and cannot be moved. Black traps cannot be moved onto red traps. Black traps can only be moved one space at a time and a rat can move any black trap on the board. Traps cannot be moved through the toilets.&#10;&#10;Moving Plumbing Tiles: A rat can choose to move 4 plumbing tiles in place of moving a trap on their turn. Only 4 plumbing tiles can be switched out, but only if there is not a rat or trap on the tile that is being switched out. The ends of the pipes on the tile being switched out must match any open end.&#10;&#10;Rolling Traps on Top of Traps: If a trap is rolled on top of an existing black trap then it is turned into a red trap. If a trap is rolled on top of an existing red trap then the one who rolled the dice can place that black trap anywhere on the board except on an existing red trap, or rat. When ever a double is rolled on a clear space it is automatically a red trap and there is only one trap for that roll. If a double is rolled on top of a black trap it becomes a red trap with an extra black trap to be placed by the one who rolled the dice anywhere on the board except an existing red trap, or on a rat. If a double is rolled on top of a red trap then the one who rolled the dice can choose to place one red trap anywhere on the board or two black traps anywhere on the board.&#10;&#10;Death of a Rat: When a rat is unable to move it is removed from the board. If after the end of your turn you are unable to move you are removed from the game. All the players pay silent homage to the departed rat and then continue the game.&#10;&#10;End of Game: The game ends when there is only one rat left to move.&#10;&#10;",

Nowadays, children buy colourful plastic stones instead of finding pebbles. It can be played alone or with friends. The stones are called gonggitdol (&#234;&#179;&#181;&#234;&#185;&#131;&#235;&#143;&#140;. Since only a few stones and a flat surface are needed for play, the game can be played by anyone almost anywhere. An equivalent game also exists in Nepal and is known as 'gatti'.&#10;&#10;The game is also called Jjagebatgi in North Gyeongsang Province, Salgu in South Gyeongsang Province, and Datjjakgeoli in South Jeolla Province.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;The game generally begins with each player tossing the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches their hand backside up. The gonggi stones are then caught on the back of the hand. The person with the leading amount plays first.&#10;&#10;How to play gonggi&#10;Level 1: The stones are thrown on the playing surface and the player picks a stone to throw up in the air. While airborne, the player picks up one stone on the playing surface. Then, the player catches the stone. These steps are repeated until all the stones have been caught.&#10;Level 2: The stones are thrown on the playing surface again. However, at this level, the player picks up the stones two at a time.&#10;Level 3: The stones are thrown on the playing surface. The stones are picked up once in a cluster of three, and the other in the amount of one.&#10;Level 4: The player throws one stone in the air, places the others on the surface, and catches the airborne stone. Then the player tosses the same stone again, but this time, picks up the four clustered stones on the playing surface and catches the airborne stone.&#10;Level 5: The player tosses the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches his hand backside up. The stones are then caught on the back of the hand. Then, the player throws the stones in the air and catches them. The number of stones caught amount to the score. There are various tricks in this phase. Some examples are &quot;The Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Clap&ndash;Toss&quot;. However, such ostentations are not allowed in official game play.&#10;&#10;Various tricks in Level 5&#10;Dragon&#10;While the stones are airborne, the player switches their hand backside up, catches several stones, switches their hand backside down, and catches the stones that are left over.&#10;&#10;Clap Toss&#10;While the stones are airborne, the player claps their hand before catching the stones.&#10;&#10;Both &ldquo;dragon&rdquo; and &ldquo;clap-toss&rdquo; gives the player twice the score; twice the number of stones.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from wikipedia&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This 122 page ruleset seeks to provide a fast and fun game of fantasy mass combat. It is the designer&rsquo;s belief that the best games result from a combination of simple rules mechanics and the opportunity for the players to make many decisions.&#10;&#10;In Pride of Lions the role of each player is that of the commanding general of the army or warlord of the horde. Magic, and the courage and skills of individual heroes, can affect the game, but the outcome of the battle will depend mainly on the clash of large units of common fighters operating under the general&rsquo;s orders.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with players issuing orders to eligible units by laying inverted movement chits behind each unit. After a magic phase, which can result in a unit&rsquo;s orders being changed involuntarily or randomly, all orders are revealed and movement is conducted simultaneously by all sides but in a strict sequence, with the most aggressive movement (charges) coming first and skirmishers going last. Both melee combat and missile fire are conducted through opposed die rolls, using dice of various sizes from D4s to D24&rsquo;s, with the difference between the die rolls determining the outcome. Factors such as terrain, magic, special weapons and tactics, and leadership and heroism by characters all affect the game either through the movement chits or the die rolls.&#10;&#10;WHY A SECOND EDITION? HOW IS THIS ONE DIFFERENT? We have a LOT more experience of gaming with these rules now, and 2nd edition reflects lessons learned. There are numerous tweaks, as well as places where a longer explanation seemed necessary for clarity. There are lots of photos, partly to show off our miniatures but also as examples of play. And there are some substantial changes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The point system is completely revised, with much greater detail, and applies now to characters as well as to units.&#10;     Dwarven rune magic is much more detailed.&#10;     Godfearers&rsquo; &ldquo;magic&rdquo; &ndash; prayer and spiritual gifts &ndash; is also far more detailed and extensive.&#10;     Spirits are developed further.&#10;     There are more and longer generic army lists and spell lists.&#10;     And the movement sequence of air units is better.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Retribution is a combat strategy game in which each player is attempting to completely clear the battlefield of the other players units. (Exception: if played with the unit, King, the game ends when he is killed)&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Players will collectively or randomly choose 10 units to play with this game. Each player has the same 10 units in thier army but with a dividing wall between them they place their units onto the board in any fashion that they choose. Then the dividing wall is taken down.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;Players then take turns activating two units each turn trying to decimate the others army. Each unit is unique in its abilities, attack, movement, and health. Although each player starts with the same army, every time one of your units is killed you get to upgrade one of your living units to its advanced version. This freedom to advance the units as you choose along with the 18+ unique units that the players have to choose from to play with gives the game incredible replay value!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sing That Word is the card game for people who love music.&#10;Even though Sing That Word involves singing, you don't have to be a good singer to be good at the game. You simply have to know songs and song lyrics!&#10;&#10;Gameplay in a nutshell: Draw a WORD card from the deck, and then take turns singing song lyrics that contain that WORD. If you successfully sing a lyric, you get a MIC card. The person with the most MIC cards at the end of the round wins the WORD card and the points associated with it (1, 2, or 3 points). The first to 7 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;It doesn't matter what genre(s) of music you like because the WORD cards in the deck were compiled based on their frequency of use across all popular genres. We will eventually release genre-specific expansion decks that contain WORD cards that are more common to that genre. (Rap, Country, Metal, Religious, etc). Extremely basic words like &quot;the&quot; and &quot;I&quot; aren't included in the deck.&#10;&#10;There are also variations of the game including Rapid Fire Mode, Kanye Mode, and Rap Battle that are described on the included RULES cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Build your herd of dinosaurs and send them to destroy your friends' nest before they get to yours. Defend yourself against rival herds with well timed Triceratops shields, redirect damage with an Ankylosaurus tail whip, or just completely wipe out your friend's herd with a meteor strike!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 4 cards, 6 Dino eggs (Life Points), and a Herbivore Habitat. Start your turn by drawing 2 cards from the Draw Pile, then choose up to 3 cards to play before ending your turn. To survive Extinction, you'll want to build an army of Dinos. You can play 2 types of egg-smashing Dinos: Herbivores and Carnivores. Since you start with a Herbivore Habitat, you are free to play Herbivore Dinos on your turn. If you're lucky to draw a Carnivore Habitat, you'll be able to cause more destruction upon your opponents with your Carnviore Dinos!&#10;&#10;All Dinos start as Hatchlings that deal baby damage to opponents. If you want real egg-crushers that deal even more damage, just feed them food! Food can be used in two ways: to grow Hatchlings and to fend off Dino attacks! Managing your food can make or break your chances of survival, so plan wisely.&#10;&#10;When it comes down to the end, there can only be one person to survive Extinction. This game forces you to test your friendships. Will you ally with your best friend or cold-heartedly wipe them out?

Help Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and their friends get the farm animals across the blanket game board and into the barn before the sun goes down.&#10;&#10;To play Mickey Mouse Snuggle Time, lay out the board, turn the sun arrow to &quot;nine&quot;, and place all five animals in the starting area. Each turn, a player spins a spinner, which will either move an animal or count down the sun arrow (in which case the player will spin again). When all animals have reached the barn, the game is over, and the sun arrow points at the players' final score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Orbita Victaris is a tactical Science-Fiction/ Fantasy card game in which two or four players compete against each other on a shared battlefield.&#10;&#10;VICTORY CONDITIONS&#10;The player who has brought the shield points of his opponent to 0 wins or if the opponent can no longer draw cards (from his deck) or when a player gives up.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;Each player starts with 6 shield points at the beginning of the game. These must be clearly visible to the opponentat all times (6-sided cube or by enclosed shield markers).&#10;&#10;The maximum hand limit is 7. If a player has more than 7 cards in his hand at the end of their turn, they must place cards on their discard piles until the card limit is reached.&#10;&#10;The card text always takes precedence over the rules in the rule book. This does not apply if the card text is incorrect.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of 5 phases, which are always traversed in this order of each move:&#10;&#10;Start-phase:&#10;&#10;In the initial phase, all effects that are activated by cards already in play at the beginning of the turn are resolved. The order in which the effects become active is determined by the active player. After all effects have been resolved with at the beginning, this phase ends and an action-event follows.&#10;&#10;Draw-phase:&#10;&#10;In this phase, the active player draws 1 card.&#10;&#10;Recovering-phase:&#10;&#10;All active player cards that are currently exausted (&lsquo;inactive&rsquo; on the side), with the exception of Nexus resources, are again recoverd (turned &lsquo;active&rsquo; / upright).&#10;&#10;Main-phase:&#10;&#10;This phase represents the main part of a turn. In its main phase, a player may play cards from his hand, declare attacks, activate unit card effects on the field, or use his operator.&#10;&#10;End-phase:&#10;&#10;At the beginning of this phase, all effects are dealt with which explicitly occur at the end of the turn. This includes the removal of played command cards with the wording until the end of the turn. As in the initial phase, the active player, if relevant, determines the order of these steps. After that, the other player starts with his initial phase.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
