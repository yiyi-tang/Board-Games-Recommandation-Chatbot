    "Description": "Each player starts his / her own penalty area, aiming at the enemy from 16 meters out. As you come through a good question to answer, divided into six categories and three levels. Throwing of two dice determines how difficult (or easy) the question and the category is. Got a question correctly, you may continue to dribble on the basis of the direction that the back of the card prescribes. &#10;In addition you must think carefully about the choices you make, because you can get a red or yellow card. An injury makes you one turn to watch from the dug-out, a yellow card forces you to skip a turn. If you collect two yellow cards or a direct red then you move back to your own penalty area and from there to set up a new attack. &#10;If you reach the penalty area of your opponent and you answer the question correctly, then you score a goal and you have won.&#10;&#10;",

One player manages the tuareg pieces and the rest are explorer looking for clues in different cities. When they draw the right cards, they can do an excavation and look one of eight treasure locations (represented by eight face down cards). When a player believes to know where the treasure is hidden, he moves his piece to that location and do an excavation; if it's correct he wins the game. The tuareg player have different rules to move his camel pieces and also can obstruct other players actions.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box art: &quot;Hace mucho tiempo los tuaregs, tribu n&oacute;mada del desierto del S&aacute;hara, encontraron una gran parte del legendario tesoro del Rey Salom&oacute;n, regalo de la Reina de Saba. El hallazgo fue por casualidad, mientras excavaban buscando un pozo enterrado por una tormenta de arena. La codicia que tal tesoro despert&oacute; consigui&oacute; romper la armon&iacute;a que hasta entonces reinaba entre este pueblo del desierto. Muchos tuaregs murieron por culpa del antiguo tesoro y Halim el Sabio, Se&ntilde;or de las duna, qued&oacute; tan apenado que mand&oacute; a sus s&uacute;bditos que enterraran el tesoro de nuevo en el desierto. Hombre previsor, Halim pens&oacute; que quiz&aacute;s en el futuro el tesoro podr&iacute;a ser &uacute;til a su pueblo, as&iacute; que esparci&oacute; pistas falsas y verdaderas por todo el desierto, para que solo &eacute;l o sus descendientes superan el lugar donde el tesoro estaba enterrado. Pero sucedi&oacute; que su bisnieto Al Denir, el Bienmandado muri&oacute; sin descendencia, y el tesoro de los tuaregs y su situaci&oacute;n se convirti&oacute; con el tiempo en tan solo una leyenda, una historia para contar junto al fuego las largas y fr&iacute;as noches del desierto...&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the first to finish their hand.&#10;&#10;The suits are related to Charlie Chaplin's general image; Canes, Shoes (untied), Neckties, and Hats.&#10;&#10;This game is interesting because the card backs are unique to each card. This theoretically enables a player to memorize the deck. Each card is unique because it has a flip book of Charlie Chaplin on the card backs. He is twirling his cane. Each card is numbered on the back so that the flip book movie can be played in order.&#10;&#10;",

The player to the left of the dealer estimates how many tricks he thinks he can take, and the highest bidder may substitute any or all of the 4 cards in the center for his 4 lowest cards.  Taking the four lowest cards from his hand he lays them down in front of him as one trick and then leads a card.  Each of the other players in turn plays a higher card if possible and the one who plays the card with the highest number takes the trick. The winner then leads a card from his hand.  If the highest bidder doesn't get the number of tricks he bid, he will have that amount deducted from his score.  All other players get one point for each trick they take.  The first player to get 50 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;The miniature cards have illustrations on them from Pinocchio.  The instructions are written on the back of the box.

Each player controls a set of 18 pieces. The game allows for two players to enter an alliance against the third. If two players engage in a coordinated attack against the third, they are entered into an alliance automatically. The player not in an alliance gains a more powerful king piece and easier win conditions to counterbalance the alliance. As in other games in the chess family, the goal is to checkmate an opponent's king. A player not in an alliance need only checkmate one player to defeat both of them.&#10;&#10;Unlike traditional games in the chess family, which have a thin military theme, kokusai sannin shogi has a thin political one, with pieces named after concepts such as public opinion, diplomacy and propaganda.&#10;&#10;Incorporates information from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannin_shogi&#10;&#10;",

Over the next five weeks, the ship visited four of the islands of the archipelago.   During these visits, Darwin collected 37 bird specimens he thought unique.  While traveling home, Darwin pondered the variations in beak size of the mockingbirds and finches he had collected.  These slight variations in beak structure, along with other small differences observed in both plants and animals he collected, were the beginnings of a radical new thought in how species came to exist.  Over the next fourteen years, Darwin expanded upon these ideas ultimately publishing his controversial treatise The Origin of Species in 1859.&#10;&#10;In this game, players help four species of finch evolve and spread throughout the Galapagos archipelago from one common ancestor.  Species evolve and migrate as they try to dominate the habitable population centers on the islands.  Each species of finch has a preferred habitat, ground or tree, and preferred food source, insects or seeds.  Players can affect the dominate species by increasing the food source or habitat type of a particular species.  At the game end, the player who has the most valuable finch collection is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Also known simply as &quot;Fate&quot;; Pendulum of FATE is an acyclic two-player perfect information luckless abstract strategy game played on a grid of any size that starts out empty.  It can also be played on a hex grid.&#10;&#10;Fate's most significant feature is the fact that players gain increasing tokens to place and use as the game progresses.  &quot;Reinforcements&quot; are calculated as a function of both the number of spaces the player already occupies at the start of his or her turn and the turn number of the game.  This increasing reinforcement calculation causes the dominance of the game to swing back and forth like a wild, accelerating pendulum, hence the name of the game.  The goal becomes timing the swings of the game such that a player is able to completely win the game before the momentum shifts right back.  The game is driven to a conclusion with one player filling the entire board and removing the final pieces of his or her opponent so only tokens of one color remain on the board.&#10;&#10;Standard Pendulum of FATE is a two-player game, but it can also be played by more with additional supplies of theoretically limitless tokens in different colors for each player.&#10;&#10;",

In this game you can make the headlines, literally.&#10;     To play the game, players lay down cards in order of color code from their hand to form a 5 card headline. The player to complete the headline gets all 5 cards and the points they are worth. Each card has it's own point value.  When the first person runs out of cards, or the draw deck is empty, the game is over.  The player with the most points wins.

    "Description": "Voir Dire is the legal name for the process by which attorneys select a jury to try a case.  Each party has the right to question potential jurors, try to understand their biases and the kinds of arguments that may be effective in reaching those jurors, strike potential jurors from the jury through the use of peremptory challenges, and then craft and focus an argument in an effort to win the selected jury to their cause.&#10;&#10;In the game of Voir Dire, players are lawyers representing different parties attempting to influence a trial jury to decide in their favor.  This strategic game simulates the voir dire process and allows the players to bluff, plan, and manipulate the jury toward their desired outcome for the case.&#10;&#10;Voir Dire is played by two players and takes about ten minutes per game.&#10;&#10;",

Once three strategic objectives are achieved players can close in on their opponent's capital. Winning an infantry battle over the enemy capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is designed to teach baseball to people of all ages, allowing them to make decisions similar to those made in an actual game.  To quote the introduction, &quot;This is the only game approved by the Little League for Little Leaguers... It can be played with easy rules for beginners, so that dad can have fun teaching his boy the fundamentals of Baseball.  It can also be played using all the science and strategy of Major League Baseball.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game consists of a field with a giant &quot;spinner&quot; embedded under it.  There are nine fielders sitting over small squares on the board, four umpires over additional squares, and a batter.  The knob in the center is spun and aligned to a space in front of the pitcher.  The player at bat then decides to swing, bunt or take the pitch.  If the pitch is taken, the umpire behind the plate will call a ball or strike.  This is done by lifting the umpire off a small square revealing the call.  If a swing is made, the batter is lifted off his square and the result of the swing is shown by a number 1-9 (indicating the player position) and the type of hit (ground ball, line drive or fly ball).  The defensive player then lifts the indicated fielder off his square to reveal whether the ball was fielded or not.  If a throw has to be made to a base, the umpire on that base makes the call.  If a runner gets on base, there are red base runners to indicate which base is occupied.  You can attempt steals, bunts, hit-and-run -- all the regular plays in baseball are available.  In addition, all the symbols are printed on the game board in foul ground so its easy to play without looking things up all the time.  A great, simple game that actually plays somewhat like the real thing.&#10;&#10;(Quotes and description from rules printed inside the box lid.)&#10;&#10;",

But watch the transaction fee which can significantly eat into your profit. You can also earn income through dividend issued by companies you are holding and other investment opportunities available in the market. However, you should not over-invest because you may need urgent cash to support your expenses. Being the major shareholder also allows you to exploit the cash reserve of the company to benefit yourself. The person who can obtain the maximum wealth at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;This is a stock market game in which the players buy and sell stocks in 5 companies.  Stock prices fluctuate according to the market position which is driven by a die roll.  Each company's stock behave very differently.  Event cards trigger the paying of dividends,  right issues, share allotments, and such.  Each company also accumulates a cash reserve which is split among its shareholders at game end (or sooner if the company becomes privatized).&#10;&#10;This is an original game designed and published in Hong Kong.&#10;&#10;",

In this game the inspiration is found with Home Make-over programs.&#10;&#10;The cows have big plans with the farm.  Bertha, Gretha, Johanna, Jacoba en Klara search the best bulls who have the best tools to do the job. Of course the girls like a bull with heavy tools. But the bulls are nowhere in sight when the heavy works begins. It's time to search for the bulls to get them in action.&#10;&#10;In this game you are the foreman who has to keep the bulls at work. Bulls with heavy tools give high victory points, but they have several weaknesses. Some of the bulls are not &quot;doing it&quot; in a safe way. Other bulls are lazy, hungry, noisy, bull shitters or not very smart or handy.&#10;&#10;The game works as a standalone but can be combined with &quot;Koe zoekt Boer&quot; (Happy Cows) and &quot;Gooishe Koeien&quot; (Trendy Cows).&#10;There also is a special card that is an expansion to &quot;Koe zoekt Boer&quot;. This is the Power Bull, which allows you to take over a turn of another player. This way turning the nice teasing game Koe zoekt Boer in a really nasty party game.&#10;&#10;",

When the cube is moved somewhere the next player may not move it back to the place where it was moved from.  One may not move the cube while their opponent is (&quot;in check&quot;) threatening to win on their next move.&#10;&#10;Winning conditions: The player who gets all of their pieces plus the cube onto different colors and simultaneously into different columns (not meaning rows) wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Building a website is not an easy task! But if you choose Drupal as your framework, you can work together with many others to make the job easier for everyone.&#10;&#10;&quot;In this quick card game 2-4 players compete to earn the most reputation by developing new Drupal modules and building complex websites!&quot; [source: rule book]&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;This card game adopts the theme of building a rich and dynamic website (i.e Web 2.0) using Drupal, open source and free software used for building content management sites (e.g. WhiteHouse.gov, PopularScience.com).&#10;&#10;In the real world, software developers create and contribute to &quot;modules&quot; that website builders can add to their core Drupal site, extending its features and functionality.&#10;&#10;Players start by playing cards representing modules (i.e. simultaneous action selection) and then build up their own contributions to those modules (i.e. turn-based play, auction/bidding) with points on colored cards representing each player. These are referred to as &quot;patch cards,&quot; since developers fix a module by patching its code.&#10;&#10;Players must contribute enough patch cards to make a module available to any player (i.e. cooperative play) to eventually build a website. They can also &quot;own&quot; that module by being its biggest contributor.&#10;&#10;Finally, players try to build websites for victory points depending on whether a module is available and its color (e.g. pink, blue or brown). Victory points are also available for individuals who contribute the most to a module's development. The winner has the most victory points. Play lasts 5-10 minutes.&#10;&#10;The design of the cards is unique in that modules and websites are combined on the same card, on either side, and the websites have the URL for well-known sites using Drupal.&#10;&#10;The order of play is as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Take 7 patch cards&#10;2. Take 6 site/module cards&#10;3. Play 3 modules&#10;4. Play patches on modules&#10;5. Audit modules&#10;6. Sites check&#10;7. Module check&#10;8.

    "Description": "The Second World War is a grand-strategic, historical simulation game about World War II. Players represent the major powers involved in the conflict and have at their command the forces with which to wage war and achieve victory for their country or alliance.&#10;&#10;The game covers the European, North African, and Pacific Theaters on three maps and four counter-sheets.&#10;&#10;Difficulty is rated at a 6 out of ten, ages 12 and up.&#10;&#10;Design Notes:&#10;The Second World War was prototyped by Peter Bertram and Randall Mac Innis in 1985. It was originally envisioned as a medium-complexity wargame to fall somewhere between the existing designs, Axis and Allies and World in Flames, which were either too pedestrian for us hard-core, grognard wargamers or too massive to be played within the confines of our housing. This final version is exactly what we envisioned when we started: a fun game about WWII with a lot of meat, but not so complicated that you need to be an accountant to enjoy it.&#10;&#10;The game scale, the 3-map composition, and the use of megahexes to regulate naval movement were originally set by Peter and Randall. They are the only elements that remained intact throughout development. While designer John D. Powers had to make many trade-offs between realism and playability, the latter was the primary concern. Once the nuances of the system are understood and exploited by all players, you will find that historical strategies will yield surprisingly historical results.&#10;&#10;I hope that players find it to be enjoyable, and despite its high-level, granular view, the most accurate grand strategic game about WWII yet to be published.&#10;&#10;What You Get&#10;&#10;     2 22x34 inch full color maps&#10;     1 17x22 inch full-color map&#10;     4 Full-color, die-cut sheets of 5/8 inch counters&#10;     1 Book of Rules&#10;     1 Book of Scenarios&#10;     Charts and Tables&#10;     Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(source: One Small Step website )&#10;&#10;",
