Just as you're beginning to piece together what's wrong, a tap on your shoulder jolts you. A shadowy figure leans in close and whispers, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been watching you. We need your help. A priceless American treasure is in danger, and a ruthless gang is closing in fast. Will you join us?&rdquo; Your heart races as fear and excitement collide. The clock is ticking, and only you can unravel the secrets hidden within the nation's landmarks before it&rsquo;s too late. Will you rise to the challenge?&#10;&#10;The Independence Incident, title #2 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.&#10;&#10;Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.&#10;&#10;When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion website (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the website will tell you which card or cards to take next. The website also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.&#10;&#10;This system is non-destructible: some groups may choose to write on cards, but this is not required. A group cannot re-play the game, but can pass it on to another group for their use.&#10;&#10;This entry in the series takes about an hour to solve, and is rated 3 out of 3 in difficulty.&#10;&#10;",

Before you have time to think, multi-ball starts placing you and the other players in competition to score the various pop bumpers, drop targets and other playfield devices. You and the other pinballs have only a short time to score the most points and complete the various combos for bonuses before it's all over and you inevitably drain.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt ten cards each of which represents a pinball playfield device. Each turn the players all select one card from their hand and one is added from the draw deck. These cards are placed face up in the center of the table and are the playfield devices that pinballs can steer towards and try to score this round. Starting with the first player, each player has three options. They may place a bid on a playfield device (Steer towards it), spend one or more control tokens to increase the speed of their pinball and they may purchase a playfield card from the discard pile. They many do any or all of these options or pass and do none. The highest bidders on each device takes their card and, assuming they meet the speed requirements to complete the device, they score it. Anyone who did not bid on a device starting with the first player selects one of the remaining devices. Pinballs must be going the speed listed on the device they get or greater to score it. If they are not, it is not scored and they still lose speed according to the device. Devices that are scored affect speed and can cause your pinball to speed up or slow down depending on the device. Besides scoring devices and trying not to drain by hitting a speed of zero, players are all competing to finish various combinations which score additional bonuses. At the end of ten rounds, the player that scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

And can you end the hunt at the most opportune time, perhaps by actually wakening the fearsome beast?&#10;&#10;Hoard is a dynamic game of hand management, set collection, and press-your-luck. Each turn players take one of four possible actions:  1) roll a custom die and move to take a new card, 2) secure a set of treasures or add to an existing set to score points, 3) affect the dragon, who wakes in stages from his tail to his head, by playing cards that soothe or rouse him, or 4) use a sword on an opponent or capture a used sword with a shield. The board is composed of 12 facedown cards surrounding the dragon.  It changes as players remove and replace the cards. Dice rolls between 1-5 enable clockwise or counterclockwise movement and the special symbol allows access to all but one of the cards, so it is a game that rewards memory.&#10;&#10;Hoard is meant to be played in rounds, with scoring tokens obviating the need for pencil and paper scorekeeping.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Race the Wind, sailing cup, is a game by Ghenos faithfully reproducing a regatta (more than 2 boats) or a match race (2 boats) without cards or dice.&#10;&#10;The race course extends on the longest side of the board, between the downwind gate, bounded by the mark and the Committee boat, and the upwind buoy.&#10;&#10;The length of the course can be changed at will by the competitors. At the beginning the wind blows from the upwind buoy (North) towards the downwind gate (South).&#10;&#10;The boats have to perform 7 electrifying starting moves, exit the downwind gate and sail 3 times upwards and 3 times downwind, moving thanks to the wind, but looking out for falls, gusts and changes of wind direction.&#10;&#10;With a precise game strategy and applying the overlap rules and wind shadows&rsquo; tactics, the best player or players (it is possible to play forming crews) will be the first to cross the finishing line and win the yearned for sailing cup.&#10;&#10;To learn to sail through its simple yet ingenious rules means to get on board, to hoist the sails and maneuver the boat as for real, experiencing a series of exciting and unforgettable challenges.&#10;&#10;The alternative name listed, Velagiochiamo, was a prototype by Saverio Robberto and Domenico Troia, the authors.  Ghenos games acquired the rights of the game and developed Race the Wind.  Velagiochiamo does not exist anymore and the only official version of the game exists as Race the Wind.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bemused is a card game for 4-6 players in which the players take on the role of a muse seeking to elevate their chosen human virtuoso to the greatest height of celebrity and influence. To do so, the muse must eliminate their virtuoso's rivals by levying doubts and dreads upon them until they are driven insane...or worse.&#10;&#10;Bemused is not a social deduction game.  Although there are elements of deductive reasoning, Bemused is a social interaction experience that encourages shameless table talk, bluffing, and deal-making as players seek to maximize their scores in a &quot;take that&quot; environment.  Bemused is best described as a strategic &quot;ruin your rivals&quot; game with hidden goals and asymmetric player powers.  It is also a much deeper strategy game than it first appears.&#10;&#10;Each player has a virtuoso card that designates their human prot&eacute;g&eacute; and a hand of doubt and dread cards.  Each turn, the player draws two doubt cards for their hand, places a doubt or dread card from their hand onto a virtuoso card, then discards a card from their hand. In some cases, a player may play two doubt cards from their hand, but this action permanently reduces their hand size. Each virtuoso has an ability that their muse may use, such as change a dread to a doubt or move a doubt from one virtuoso to another.  Scheming, negotiating, and table talk are encouraged!&#10;&#10;When a virtuoso is saddled with a combined total of five doubt and/or dread cards, the virtuoso is driven insane. An insane virtuoso still gets their turn and may still win the game, but their options for which cards they may play on their turn is limited by their insanity. If an insane virtuoso has more dread than doubts, that virtuoso dies and becomes a fantasma that haunts the remaining living virtuosos. A fantasma may still win the game!&#10;&#10;Each muse's prot&eacute;g&eacute; also has a gemina, a secret virtuoso in the game that holds a psychic link with their prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and a secret that describes how their prot&eacute;g&eacute; feels about their gemina, and how the player's score will be affected by the state of their prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s gemina when the game ends (e.g., the player may gain points if their virtuoso's gemina is not insane at the end of the game).  Once a virtuoso's gemina is revealed, a player may use the gemina's ability as well as their prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s ability!  A player may also reveal and use their virtuoso's gemina for a price... but whenever a virtuoso goes insane, their gemina automatically flips over and can have severe consequences for play...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The date: March 1938. The vast majority of Austrians cheer the Anschluss of their country by the German Reich. Central Europe is falling into Nazi hands and all the best European scientists will soon compete under the aegis of Heinrich Himmler, for whom no scheme is too wild or too improbable &mdash; but which team has the imagination, the courage, and the drive to most successfully accomplish their goals?&#10;&#10;Secret Weapons of the Third Reich is a game for one to four players simulating the arms race of World War II from the German perspective. From secret submarine bases in Greenland to the mysterious Base 211 in Neuschwabenland, Antarctica, this game recreates the incredible tales of Nazi technology, from the famous V-1 buzz bombs and V-2 rockets to the unlikely flying saucers derived from the work of Nikola Tesla. Will players be able to deliver the Haunebu project to completion? Will Hans Kammler escape with his last battalion of flying saucers to the dark side of the moon? Will the secret submarine fleet sail to Antarctica to pursue the war after the war? Or could German scientists produce an atomic bomb to be dropped on New York by an electro-gravitational flying saucer or within the warhead of a futuristic intercontinental V-3? Would it even be possible to build a huge solar satellite gun to strike America?&#10;&#10;In the game, each player controls one or more research groups, each working on a secret weapon project. Each research group has a leading researcher, who provides an initial bonus (expressed in resource cubes or scientist cylinders) when the project is assigned. The researcher has a regime loyalty value that measures both the ability to make requisition attempts and the ability to resist opposing attempts.&#10;&#10;A player tries to get their projects approved, then completed. Certain requirements (resource cubes and/or scientist cylinders and technologies attached to projects) must be met and costs paid in order to reach the stage of development of a project. Each turn, approved projects generate specific amounts of resource cubes as funding. Completed projects award victory points (VP) and allow, in most cases, weapon production. Produced weapons award VP to the owning player in addition to helping to achieve a cooperative goal for all players. In fact, if together the players fail to reach a certain number of weapons produced by the end of the game, they all lose. The weapon production goal varies depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;Play begins in 1938, one year before the outbreak of world war. At the start, players can only place research groups for their approved projects (project plants) in the portion of the map representing Germany and Austria. In 1939 and later, the conquests of Nazi Germany allow players to deploy their project plants in occupied European territories &mdash; but players will have to pay attention to the various locations because some areas allow only research and development, others only weapon production, and still others only research and development for U-Boat projects.&#10;&#10;Also, players must operate in a &quot;state of warfare&quot;. This means that as time goes on they are more and more subject to enemy bombardments that can cause a great loss of resources and technologies. In addition, as starting in 1943 Allied and Soviet advances on Berlin make the map progressively smaller, players must face logistical issues never encountered during the early years of the war.&#10;&#10;Should a completed project or produced weapon fall into Allied hands, players not only lose VP, but the weapons production goal recedes as well! Thus a certain amount of player cooperation is a must. Each player must balance his personal interests with the common need to share technologies and resources in order to fulfill the common goal.&#10;&#10;Last, but not least, via events one player may secretly become the turncoat, working in the shadows to help the enemy, and winning the game if all players would otherwise lose.&#10;&#10;",

Tanks, armored vehicles, anti-tank guns, mortars, infantry, air support and artillery are at the tip of your fingers. In 16 scenarios, the Italians, Germans and Vichy French fight against the British, their Commonwealth allies from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the Americans and the Free French. New to the system are obstacles such as Wire and Anti-Tank Ditches. What would desert combat be without that ever-unpredictable variable: Dust. It&rsquo;s Panzer IIs, IIIs, and IVs against M3 Lees and M5 Stuarts, and M13/40s and L3s against Crusaders, Valentines and M3 Grants. It&rsquo;s Armored Infantry in desperate close assaults, and ATGs, air support and mines.&#10;&#10;&quot;It&rsquo;s a fluid struggle pitting tank on tank, and now you can re-fight these battles using the popular Nations at War system. Based on the popular World at War tactical system, NAW depicts platoon level combat in World War II. In NAW you'll find everything you're looking for in a platoon level game: armor, artillery, infantry serving as more than cannon fodder, command and control, air support, and desperate close assaults that leave the victor in possession of the ground and the defeated in headlong retreat.&quot;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;308 Color Counters&#10;Four 11&quot; x 17&quot; Mounted Maps&#10;Rules &amp; Scenario Booklet&#10;Player's Aid Cards&#10;Dice&#10;&#10;Other Games in Series:&#10;&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising&#10;    Nations at War: Stalin's Triumph&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising &#226;&#128;&#147; Airborne&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising &#226;&#128;&#147; Operation Cobra&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Neither side was fully aware of the other&rsquo;s position. Faced with the unknown both armies conformed to type with the French defending strongly and the Germans attacking. For once, though, the French far outnumbered the Germans. As a result a heavily outnumbered German army was forced to make a series of attacks to prevent the French discovering its weakness and to deny the French their retreat to the west.&#10;&#10;Had the French pushed the Germans aside they would have been able to combine their armies and possibly protect Paris.

    "Description": "Battles of Napoleon is an epic game series that simulates the most famous battles of Napoleon on a tactical scale sharing the same basic rules.&#10;&#10;The series portrays the most important aspects of battles of the Napoleonic era with easy to learn and remember rules, intuitive mechanics and procedures. Players may focus on taking decisions and playing rather than consulting rules.&#10;&#10;The system focusses on the &ldquo;cat-and-mouse game&rdquo; of coordination and timing of the various formations of the different arms without too much crunchy chrome.&#10;&#10;Infantry was the predominant and most important element in every European army of the period. It usually formed between 60 and 90 per cent of an army in battle, and was both the cheapest and the most versatile type of troops. The foot soldiers had to endure most of the fighting and casualties. Depending on their task, they were either deployed in line (fire power), column (maneuver and assault) or square formation (protection against enemy cavalry).&#10;&#10;Cavalry were screening the own army and provided the shock element on a Napoleonic battlefield. Due to their shock power they fixed enemy infantry and forced them to take shelter in square formation. If infantry failed to form square they were overrun. If infantry was fixed in semi-static squares they were very vulnerable to artillery fire.&#10; Artillery, the queen of the battlefield, was on the one hand having devastating effects on square and closely packed formations, on the other hand artillery alone was extremely vulnerable when getting charged by enemy units.&#10;&#10;Generals are tasked with taking advantage of favorable terrain like the famous Duke of Wellington who mastered the reverse slope tactic.&#10;&#10;By a simple game mechanic, players will never know the exact strength and power of an enemy unit. Units have a number of strength points that will gradually decrease while engaged with enemy units.&#10;&#10;An innovative chit-based Command system, where players randomly draw activation chits determines which army may activate a formation, leads to highly interactive game play. Reaction follows action. We bring the chit-based Command system to a new level: In this games series, players decide which formation is activated when a chit is drawn. A formation may be activated several times per turn. But by each new activation it performs less effective.&#10;&#10;During a game turn the players are under constant pressure to decide which formation to activate. By efficient timing of activation players are in the &ldquo;driver&rsquo;s seat&rdquo; to dictate the pace of a battle.&#10;&#10;Formations are given orders at the beginning of a game turn and are therefore limited by the actions they can perform on the battlefield. The more &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; orders formations will receive, the more likely is the army will collapse due to fatigue. On the other hand, an army is more likely to gain the initiative on the battlefield by &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; orders.&#10;&#10;The scale of the series is appr. 150 meters per hex, infantry units are battalions, artillery is batteries and cavalry is represented as regiments. A game turn represents 60 minutes. Within a game turn a formation may be activated up to three times (with lower performance on each activation).&#10;&#10;The bloody winter battle of EYLAU 1807 will be the first volume in this series. Special rules like the possibility to launch a massive cavalry charge and features like snow storms, Russian Cossacks and the French Guard add distinctive flavor of the battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Envelopes of Cash is a Euro board game with a very American theme: college football recruiting.  Players square off as rival college programs, doing their best to attract the most valuable high schoolers to join their college teams.&#10;&#10;Game play is driven by a card draft, in which players acquire the potential to hire new personnel, build new facilities, strengthen their program's culture, or boost their fundraising prowess, but to actually put those cards into play, the need to generate income via careful selection of 6 different colored dice, which are rolled at the start of each turn.  Those dice generate the most valuable currency in the game -- Envelopes of Cash -- which are used to lure the athletes to your program.  To succeed, you need to balance the benefits of your cards, which make recruiting easier, with the nuts and bolts of actually getting out there and recruiting, by sending lots of recruiting mail, traveling to visit the athletes in their home states, and most importantly, slipping them those valuable tokens of your affection in little colored envelopes.&#10;&#10;You only have 12 months to gather as many different recruits across a variety of football positions (like QB, LB, etc.), so the tension between less income now vs. more income later plays a role in shaping your strategy.  Should you jump out to a quick start and get the best recruits before your opponents, or should you build up a big stash of envelopes of cash and have a major blow out month towards the end of the year.  Or can you build a strategy more around your personnel and culture, turning their special abilities into a victory point engine and leave the grubby business of bribes to others?&#10;&#10;Envelopes of Cash lets you be the head coach of a major football program, working closely with your bag men to make sure you come out on top in the race for the most recruiting points.  With 120 different cards and a different mix of recruits across regions each time, the game offers high replay value, especially since there are many different ways to build a successful program that churns out points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Geometric Art is a party game which is a drawing game in which everyone take turns to drawing and guessing, The simple goal is to let the guesser understand the name of your artwork. Remember, you may only be able to finish your &quot;Art work&quot; with a few geometric symbols.&#10;&#10;In Geometric Art , every round will exchange a guesser who guess questions. Each round there will be a theme. Within this theme, the artist can complete the artwork with the symbols specified above the dice. The guesser can guess the name of the artwork of every artist, If it's right, both get more rewards, but if guess wrong, both will be punished. Those who first get 10 points to win, but If you have too many penalty points, you will be eliminated.&#10;&#10;Compared to traditional painting games, there is no need for painting talent, but need more wonderful inspiration.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Excerpts from the Clash of Arms website:&#10;&#10;Brandywine &amp; Germantown expands the Battles from the Age of Reason Series into the American War of Independence. The games adhere closely to the highly successful BAR rules system. The major change lies in the halving of the strength point ratio so that 1 point equals 50 men, 25 horsemen, or 1 cannon, accommodating the smaller battles and units of North America. There is a noted lack of cavalry in both battles. The counters are in the same style as the other BAR games, but with some interesting variations (e.g., rifle frocks). Brandywine (three maps) has 4 scenarios: Knyphausen's attack at Chads Ford, Cornwallis' attack at Birmingham Meeting House (both one mappers), Howe's historical plan (comprising both Knyphausen's and Cornwallis' attacks), and an optional Howe plan. The latter scenario will allow the British player to select alternative schemes of maneuver to attack the Americans.  Washington, in turn, has the ability to gain intelligence on the British movements      (both true and false information) and possibly readjust his force. Germantown (two maps) has 2 scenarios. They vary based on whether or not the Americans are required to seize the Chew House.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Hunt for Red October depicts &quot;modern&quot; naval combat in the North Atlantic, Soviets vs. Nato.&#10;&#10;The game contains 8 scenarios that place various combinations of aircraft, surface ships, and submarines at the players' disposal. The map is broken up into irregular &quot;spaces&quot; containing land, shallow or deep sea. Land spaces may contain airbases and/or ports; sea spaces may contain standing detection patrols (SOSUS, etc).&#10;&#10;Pieces are double sided cardboard of 3 different sizes (capital ships/task forces, small ships/submarines, and aircraft) with the back only giving the basic information (a formation of aircraft, a submarine silhouette or a Task Force symbol) to keep the specific information of the unit secret from the opponent. Each unit has a detection rating and an attack rating.&#10;&#10;Each side starts each turn with a random number of detection attempts (2+d10 for NATO, 2+d6 for Soviet). Pieces are moved on the board (ships/subs up to 3 spaces, aircraft up to 1, 4, or 8 depending on type). As opposing pieces are moved into the same spaces, detection attempts are spent trying to locate the enemy units in the space (usually d10 &lt;= detection rating). Detected units are turned sideways so both sides can see it. Once units are found combat may be initiated.&#10;&#10;Combat is done in two attack phases. Dice are rolled vs. the attack rating of the attacking unit(s) (usually 1 d10 but there are exceptions) and hits are determined and resolved simultaneously. Ships that did not fire in the first phase conduct a second attack phase. Units can be in combat if not detected but upon firing become detected (which means undetected units almost invariably shoot in the second phase). Hits are again determined. 1, 2 or 3 hits (subs, small surface ships, large surface ships) are required to destroy a unit. Aircraft are destroyed only if the hit on them was a rolled 1 or 2. Victory is determined by scenario conditions. There are several optional rules, none of which appear to significantly increase the complexity of the game.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you can roll dice up to three times. At the end of the turn, you look to see if you fulfill the requirements to move one of your mountain goats toward the summit.&#10;&#10;Each path up the mountain has its own dice combination. The closer to the peak, the larger the required dice results (from three-of-a-kind and small straight to full house or five-of-a-kind), and the narrower the paths. In spaces of the upper half of the game board, there is room for only one mountain goat to stand. If you reach an occupied space, you may push one of your goats there one space toward the peak; on the other hand, you push one of your opponents' goats back toward the valley. Whoever can get two of their mountain goats to the summit first wins.&#10;&#10;",

In each round, players take turns placing workers to gather letter tiles, action cards, and a die. The letter tiles are used to construct words on the players' tableaus. The action cards provide a variety of actions. For example, some cards are &quot;resource cards&quot; that provide an alternative way to collect resources. Other cards provide the ability to manipulate letters. Other cards provide victory points and other special powers. The die chosen has two functions: (1) to move player's pawns along a track whose spaces provide more abilities and (2) to activate some of the action cards.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever ends up with the most gems wins!&#10;&#10;The gems are on tiles that are shuffled, stacked, and placed inside a cardboard castle. Using a plastic slider that goes under the bottom edge of the castle, players push out tiles to create a row of gems that the wizard is levitating away from the castle.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four colored pebbles. On a turn, you move your figure to a new space on the path of tiles, paying a pebble of the color space to which you move. You then draw pebbles from the bag based on the space to which you moved. Finally, if you can pay pebbles exactly matching the number and color of the gems depicted on the tile, you claim that tile. (You have tricked the wizard into stealing pebbles instead of gems.)&#10;&#10;Reveal the bottom of the tile to see whether nothing happens, a number of new tiles are revealed, or you take another turn. Continue taking turns until the magic path tile is revealed from the castle. At the end of that round, count your gems to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

There are special cards gotten from having the most in a category that give you a bonus, often affecting the bidding process.  For example, the Palace lets you see all bids before placing yours and the Heir lets you claim an unclaimed dynasty card.&#10;&#10;From back of the box:&#10;&#10;Following the collapse of the Han Dynasty, warlords backed rival claimants to the Chinese Throne, while others sought influence among the merchants, nobles, farmers, and bureaucrats.&#10;&#10;Each round, players play Bid Cards to claim Dynasty Cards and take control of the Emperor, Heir, Palace, Market, and Harvest.  However, the heavens in the guise of a Celestial Dragon, can disrupt the best laid plans.  The game ends as the Emperor dies and whoever gains the most influence will ascen the throne.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Maori Wars is a simulation of the principal uprisings that took place between 1845 and 1872 due to British colonial incursions into native Maori lands on the North Island of New Zealand. Conflict involved the destruction of numerous villages, pas (strongly fortified villages that featured intricate trench-works) and colonial settlements. The war introduced the British to a wily well-armed enemy whose defense works and strategy of ambush surprised and stymied them. As scenarios progress so does the extent of the conflict. More British regulars, native born Australian troops and New Zealand militia enter and are allied with increasingly more tribes who tend to change sides at the most inopportune times (those supporting the British came to be known as Queenites).&#10;&#10;Historical scenarios feature low counter density, quick play time (under two hours), and features a novel bush-raiding rule that allows the Maori player to move units temporarily off the map and then back in a location of his choice. As the British player gains experience he learns to track these tribes. At which point he enters and battles these units in the bush. Maori resistance is dependent on village support so as fortified villages fall to British control, resistance melts away. Random battle dispatches reflect historical circumstances. Events such as: SEEK PEACE, NEW RELIGION, and CONCERNED TRIBES force players to deal with new and developing crises. The English may build forts but are penalized for fort-building as they historically caused local uprisings. Canoes and gunboats allow rapid transport and in the case of gunboats waterborne artillery support. Standard British artillery and cavalry are introduced but play only a minor supporting role. Terrain and knowledge of the terrain is the Maori&rsquo;s secret weapon. Relative troop strength is designed to allow the possibility of historical outcomes not the proportionate historical strength. The overwhelming British superiority of men and firepower made the successes of the Maori forces all the more remarkable.&#10;&#10;Map Scale:    10 miles per hex&#10;Unit Size:     Battalions/Strength Points&#10;Time Scale:     3 months per turn&#10;&#10;(from Legion Wargames website)&#10;&#10;",

The crisis of the third century - a decades-long fever dream of civil war, plague, and economic ruin - stretched it thinner and thinner, until finally, inevitably, it splintered. The Palmyrene Empire to the east, the Gallic Empire to the west, and sandwiched between them, the remnants of the Roman Empire. Deprived of its richest provinces and stuck in a series of endless wars along the frontier, it seemed destined, at last, to fall. But in 270, when the emperor died, troops along the Danube did what troops along the Danube always did, and demanded that their commander take the purple. His name was Lucius Domitius Aurelianus, and over the course of his short reign, he would do the impossible: he would put this broken world back together again.&#10;&#10;Aurelian, Restorer of the World is a Strategic level Solitaire board-wargame from Tom Russell, the designer of Agricola, Master of Britain and Charlemagne, Master of Europe. Like those titles, three cups are used to represent shifting attitudes toward Aurelian's rule; actions you take will move chits from one cup to another. This game is shorter and faster than the two previous games, lasting a maximum of six turns. It's also more difficult. Beyond marching around the map, quelling revolts, and smacking down usurpers, you must manage monies, maintain a strong defensive line along the Danube, make war against Germanic tribes, build up city defenses, and spread the cult of Sol Invictus. You do not have nearly enough time or resources to do all of these things equally well, and will need to make hard choices. If you succeed, you will earn the title afforded to Aurelian by the senate: Restitutor Orbis, &quot;Restorer of the World&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You and your friends have run out of gas on the side of the highway and need to find help. You need to search for keys and gas by using actions to flip tokens, and once those items have been found you need to get back to the van in order to escape. Leatherface will chase the players throughout the map, and if he catches a player, he takes them to the Killing Room. Once there, the player has three turns to attempt escape before Leatherface eliminates the player.&#10;&#10;",

The leader of the thieves wins if Sidibaba and his friends don't get out of the caves in time, or when he manages to catch Sidibaba and his friends when they don't have a spare oil lamp left. As a result, each camp has its own objectives and its own mode of operation.&#10;&#10;Sidibaba is a real-time game in which players have a limited amount of time to negotiate or else they'll watch their torches go out one by one, eventually leaving them lost in the dark.&#10;&#10;Sidibaba was originally designed as Theseus, with the players trying to outwit the Minotaur in its maze.&#10;&#10;",

Players may even go most of the game without a weapon at all, hoping to dodge their way through.&#10;&#10;All players begin the game bitten, already infected by the zombie virus. No one can be trusted, not even that girl from band camp. Your objective: Be the first player to run down the hall, find an antidote in the science lab, and get back through the zombie-filled corridor to the exit. Only the first through will live, locking the door behind him to prevent the spread of the outbreak, which means everything and everyone on the board is an enemy. You may have to choose between killing a zombie or tripping a friend into your undead classmates to slow them down or eliminate them.&#10;&#10;But take heed because players who die before taking an antidote join the game to feast on the living. Unlike the mindless horde, they rise as extremely deadly &quot;smart zombies&quot;, still playing with their full hand and hunting the living players. It's even possible for zombie players to win cooperatively by killing everyone else.&#10;&#10;Student Bodies creates an intense feeling of desperation and maintains it throughout, while the humor comes from the horrible lengths players will go to survive at the expense of the others. Randomized board elements and a customizable zombie AI deck keep the game fresh and allow its difficulty to be raised or lowered to a significant degree.&#10;&#10;",

Players pick through piles, trade comics, and grow their collections wisely to score the most points!&#10;&#10;The game is typically played for 3 rounds. Each round the comic book cards are shuffled to form a deck which is then used to create a market (the Comic Book Shop) and three piles of comics. The round ends when the deck and piles have run out. In their turn, players first determine to trade with either the Comic Book Shop or with another player, then they proceed to pick piles. Players look at the last pile and decide to keep it or move on to the next pile, adding a card to the pile they just looked at. Once a player picks a pile, the cards are immediately added to their collection and are used to form or expand comic book sets. At the end of the round, players score points based on how complete their sets are as well as any special bonuses for that round. After the third or final round, the player with the most total points wins!&#10;&#10;Original design by John Retterer-Moore&#10;Development by Miguel Martinez and Aaron Burghard&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Three rather green forces (one Union army and two Rebel forces) met at Wilson&rsquo;s Creek and clashed on &ldquo;Bloody Hill&quot;. Little did they know how bloody the war would be.&#10;&#10;The commanders were also new to this level of fighting and two novice errors shaped the historic battle. The Union commander, General Lyon, detailed his battle plan to his commanders and then was talked into dividing his smaller force in two at the last minute. The Rebels had dissention amongst Generals McCulloch and Price over whether they should attack immediately or not. After cancelling an advance to attack the next morning (August 10th), they forgot to repost pickets when they returned to their camps. This mistake left them open to the Union surprise attack the next morning. After great initial success, the Union forces ran low on ammunition, lost General Lyon and ended up leaving the field. It didn&rsquo;t have to be that way as the Union forces had a very good chance of conducting a successful &ldquo;spoiling&rdquo; attack. The &ldquo;What If&rdquo; scenario gives the Union player a chance to adjust his strategy and win the battle.&#10;&#10;The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale simulation of the battle that can be completed in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules normally found in such games, while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features the Blind Swords chit-pull system, which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOWs&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;-22 x 34 inch Map&#10;-176 x 5/8 inch Counters&#10;-Full Color Exclusive Rulebook&#10;-Series Rulebook (Black and White)&#10;-5 Player Aids&#10;-Box or ziploc bag&#10;-2 Dice (Boxed Version)&#10;&#10;",

Players take the role of rich merchants based in Tadmor (also known as Palmyra). They will increase in power and prestige by expanding their trading routes and by contributing to the political and religious life of the city. In the game, a merchant&rsquo;s success is measured in Prestige Points. The winning merchant is the one who scores the most Prestige at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has a number of Camels and Ships that can be sent to different locations on the board to collect wood, stones, marble or gold and use these resources, in turn, to acquire rare goods, fulfil specific missions presented by the King or build the city temple or the tower.&#10;&#10;Each development line has its own advantages and drawbacks: the Tower provides prestige points during the game and can boost your scoring significantly but it is highly competitive. Also, the more Tower levels you build the higher the building costs. Acquiring Rare goods is key to get more ships which are the main way to collect resources but you must time your purchases very well to get the different sets of goods that can boost your final scoring. King&rsquo;s Missions are very versatile: they are worth a good number of prestige points at game end but also carry a one-off benefit that can result crucial at a certain points in the game. Finally, building the Temple is a slow way of adding prestige points but can give you a dramatic boost when you manage to complete its construction in full. Growing your trading enterprise and your prestige does not make you immune from danger. Marauders sweep the Syrian Desert plains or sail along the coast to intercept and rob your peaceful merchants. You will have to use all your intuition to spot which region they will attack and avoid placing your Camels and Ships there or these will be lost!&#10;&#10;Different strategies can be built by acquiring improvements that let you excel on specific areas of the game. The wide range of improvements available and the fact that the mix changes at every game ensures that no play session is the same.&#10;&#10;",

Two ill prepared, yet superior in numbers, Imperial Russian armies attack East Prussia in August 1914 in order to honor the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894.&#10;Even though the Russian attack turned out to a disaster, it played an important role on the Western Front. German reserves were pulled from the West to East Prussia, that otherwise would have been used in the crucial battle of the Marne north of Paris.&#10;&#10;The Game Design&#10;The game mechanics includes a chit-pull procedure. The low density of units provides a fast-pace battle where every move is vital for victory. &#10;The game is taught in 30 minutes and is easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 6.2 miles / 10 km&#10;Units: Brigade to Army&#10;&#10;More on the Game Design&#10;The game addresses the players on the classical elements 20th century warfare.&#10;&middot;Importance of finding local superiority&#10;&middot;Balancing between attack and defense&#10;&middot;Timing of maneuver and decisive blows&#10;&middot;Command and Control&#10;&middot;Lines of Supply&#10;The German player has to work with small means and time his strategies in order to succeed and keep the Russian player from pressing far in to East Prussia. The Russian player must press on to force out the reinforcements from the western front and use his superiority in order to come out as victor. All is set for yet another classical engagement!&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Special Ops #3 edition):&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (252 1/2&quot; &amp; 5/8&quot; counters, of which only 146 are used in this game)&#10;One 12-page A Victory Complete rule booklet&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the back of the box :)&#10;&#10;The thunder of the guns that August would deafen all Europe. For the next four years there would be no quiet: on the western front in France, on the eastern front in Russia, in the Italian Alps and the Balkan foothills, the only peace would be among the dead.&#10;&#10;Recreating the Great War of 1914-1918, GUNS OF AUGUST is a unique, exciting game. As the Central Powers player YOU control the armies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and make the difficult strategic decisions the two-front war requires. As the Allied player YOU command the forces of the rest of Europe Including Britain, France, Russia. Italy, Belgium, Rumania, Serbia, and the United States, and carry the burden of forcing back the strongly entrenched enemy corps on both the west and eastern fronts. No other game presents so great a challenge to test each player's grasp of military strategy.&#10; Ten Historical Scenarios From the summer of 1914 through the final surrender on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day and month of 1918, GUNS OF AUGUST spans the entire First World War in monthly Game-Turns; each player maneuvers hundreds of infantry and cavalry corps and their supporting artillery and engineer regiments. And in addition to this mammoth campaign game, separate scenarios for each front during each year of the war, which can be combined into two-front scenarios for 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, have been specially designed to allow players to vary the size, difficulty, and playing time of their games.&#10;&#10;For those who think that World War I Is an unexciting subject for a game, GUNS OF AUGUST will prove a shock comparable to the appearance of British tanks at Cambrai, and German stosstrupen at Caporetto.&#10;&#10;COMPLEXITY: Rated &quot;5&quot; on a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (hard) &#10;1040 Counters&#10;&#10;(BGG description :)&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's definitive World War I game.  &#10;Comes with 4 mapboard panels showing all of the major theaters of the war to end all wars. Cardboard cut out counters are colored the same as the uniforms of the respective countries. Several charts included for weather (rain creates mud), entry of new combatant countries, and combat results tables.&#10;&#10;",

One of these three brothers is you, but the road to becoming a knight is extremely long!&#10;&#10;In Knights, you have to travel the vast royal lands &mdash; crossing snowy mountains, haunted lakes, and dark forests &mdash; in search of bracelets of bravery. You might find yourself face to face with a troll, an old wizard, or a warrior, and you must solve riddles to discover hidden compartments, to learn fighting techniques, and to collect magic items. Your success depends on your choices because you are the hero!&#10;&#10;Knights is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &quot;The comic in which you are the hero&quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!&#10;&#10;",

Myraclia is a strategy game to be enjoyed on many occasions with many different people...&#10;&#10;Rudy Priecinsky, Designer of Myraclia&#10;&#10;- - -&#10;&#10;Planet Myraclia. Deserted and inhospitable. Wildly controlled by the elements. Life has no place here...&#10;&#10;But you came! With your divine powers. You know, or more precisely, you want to turn Myraclia...to a dreamed planet full of life. The task is not easy. You have to subdue chaotic elements of nature, organize them, establish order, to give life a chance...&#10;&#10;But you are not alone. Others want to turn Myraclia into their picture. Resources and time are limited. If you want to think of Myraclia as your creation, you have to fight with others ruthlessly for resources, but the form of Myraclia as well.&#10;&#10;Your goals are noble. But are your motives?&#10;&#10;- - -&#10;&#10;THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;In the game, you compete with other players for the title of The Creator of Myraclia. You are trying to get limited and chaotically emerging elements and sources of life. These are represented by glittering cubes in 7 colors in uneven numbers. You have to get them, organize them correctly, possibly replace them with the other player's elements, and ..... a miracle! The desolate and inhospitable part of Myraclia changes into a beautiful cradle of life.&#10;&#10;The Myraclia surface is divided into hexagonal tiles. One side of the tile represents the original look of Myraclia, before the transformation, without life, the other side of the terraformed appearance, the new beautiful face of Myraclia full of greenery. There are 4 types of surfaces, namely plains, forests, water areas, and mountains.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in rounds, divided into two basic phases.&#10;&#10;In the first &ndash; drafting phase &ndash; players alternate in the specified order and select one element (cube) from the drafting board to help them transform (re-shape) a part of the planet in the next phase. But remember. Not the same resources are available in each round. Those elements, which were abundant in the last round and nobody wanted them, can now be scarce and desirable. And vice versa. The price for gaining a rare element is great. Speed - and sometimes greed &ndash; during elements selection determine the player order for an important second phase.&#10;&#10;In the second phase - the terraformation - the players, according to the order set in the first phase, turn the individual deserted parts of the planet into Myraclia full of life. They discard the elements displayed on the Myraclia tile and turn it to a terraformed side. In most parts, they instantly earn points and/or a bonus in the form of the free released element. A released element can be used immediately. Order is key, but the first position does not necessarily mean an absolute advantage. If you were greedy in the first phase or you have chosen the wrong combination of elements, other players in turn could exchange their elements for your unused elements. The reward for the conversion of Myraclia is, in addition to the points, also the right to reveal new parts of the planet (by choosing new Myraclia tiles from the offer).&#10;&#10;The game ends in a round in which any player has terraformed 7 parts of Myraclia planet or if a certain part of the planet has been terraformed (i.e. it is not possible to replenish the offer of Myraclia tiles).&#10;&#10;Until the last moment, you cannot be sure who gets the title of The Creator of Myraclia.&#10;&#10;At final scoring, players are rewarded by the final look of the planet Myraclia and receive a bonus for the most consecutive terraformed area of the planet, for the variety of the terraformed surface, but also for the size of individual types of surfaces terraformed by the player.&#10;&#10;Your reward is a brand new Myraclia, beautiful, full of life. And also the feeling that you have contributed to it ..... the most.&#10;&#10;",
