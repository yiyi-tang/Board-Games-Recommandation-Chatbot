    "Description": "On March 15, 1848, mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda enabled Hungarian reformists to push through a list of 12 demands. Faced with revolution both at home and in Vienna, Austria first had to accept Hungarian demands. Later, under governor Lajos Kossuth and the first Prime minister, Lajos Batthy&aacute;ny, the House of Habsburg was dethroned and the form of government was changed to create the first Republic of Hungary. Initially, the Hungarian forces (Honv&eacute;ds&eacute;g) defeated Austrian armies. To counter the successes of the Hungarian revolutionary army, Franz Joseph asked for help from the &quot;Gendarme of Europe,&quot; Czar Nicholas I, whose Russian armies invaded Hungary. The huge army of the Russian Empire and the remnants of the Austrian forces proved too powerful for the Hungarian army, and General Art&uacute;r G&ouml;rgey surrendered in August 1849.&#10;&#10;Ne engedj a negyvennyolcb&oacute;l! is a card game based on the theme of political unrest and the Hungarian freedom fighters during this turbulent time in Hungarian history.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Age of Muskets Volume II: Eagles Rising  &#10; &quot;Eagles Rising&quot; is the second volume of our Age of Muskets Series, it covers Napoleon's Campaign in Northern Italy 1796-97. There, Napoleon made a name for himself and earned the prestige that would put in his hands the destinies of France and, eventually, of Europe.&#10;&#10;The Campaign started with Bonaparte's offensive in the spring of 1796 that knocked the Piedmontese Kingdom out of the war and subjected it to French power. Then followed the struggle against Austrian attempts to relieve the besieged Mantua, and retake the Po River Valley that led to the Battle of Rivoli in January 1797. Finally with Napoleon's offensive in the spring of 1797 that led to Leoben (on the road to Vienna) and, eventually, to his victory over the First Coalition.&#10;&#10;As in Volume I the game includes all the elements that characterized pre-industrial warfare. However, the player will also find some elements distinctive of this campaign, as Alpine terrain, a different map and time scale to reflect the duration of the campaign as well as certain historical details (the systematic looting by the French, the revolts against French occupation ...). Given the size of the armies involved most of the scenarios of this Volume are quite adequate for two players since there are few headquarters and their size is quite manageable.&#10;&#10;However, the game title would be incomplete if it referred only to this first campaign of Napoleon. The box also includes the necessary counters and scenarios to play the Austro - Russian counteroffensive of 1799-1800 that ended at the famous Battle of Marengo, the first that Bonaparte fought and won as First Consul of the Republic after his return from Egypt.&#10;&#10;Marshall Suvorov and the Russian Army, with their Austrian allies, expelled the French from all their Italian conquests. Bonaparte's counterattack in 1800 came after Suvorov and Russia retired from the conflict but, what if things had been otherwise? You may explore this exciting possibility in the Napoleon vs. Suvorov scenario.&#10;&#10;Each game contains:&#10;- 2 70x50 cm maps (together form a 50x140 cm map of northern Italy, Switzerland and Germany) &#10;- 8 battlefield terrain overlays &#10;- 2 sets of Player Aid Sheets (3 sheets per set)&#10;- 2 HQ Display Sheets&#10;- 2 ten sided dice&#10;- 1 set of Army Sheets for photocopying &#10;- 832 counters (4 counter sheets)&#10;- 1 &ldquo;Age of Muskets Series Rules&quot; booklet&#10;- 1 Eagles' Rising booklet including special rules, scenarios, historical notes and designer notes.&#10;Eagle's Rising is not just a game, it's a whole gaming experience including 6 battle scenarios (Rivoli, Marengo, First Zurich, Second Zurich, Novi and Trebbia) and 11 campaign scenarios, ordered by increasing complexity, from the 2 turns of &quot;Piedmont's Defeat&quot; to the full campaigns of 1796-97 and 1799-1800. This includes Suvorov's campaign in Switzerland and a hypothetical campaign pitting Suvorov against Bonaparte!!!!&#10;&#10;It will be possible to put together Volume II with the next in the series: &quot;Vienna or Death&quot; which deals with the campaigns of 1796-97 and 1799-1800 in southern Germany with Moreau vs Archduke Charles in action.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;[En Espanol:]El juego est&aacute; en ingl&eacute;s pero encontrar&aacute;s en esta p&aacute;gina (Apoyo al Jugador) los archivos en espa&ntilde;ol necesarios para jugar &ndash;Hojas de Ayuda, Reglas y Escenarios.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Anomalies of Love is a game about love and relationships. The game starts when players meet their special someone. As they get to know each other better they can focus on the 8 things that their relationship can rely on, the things that hold the couple together &ndash; matching sense of humour, mutual outdoor hobbies, mutual intellectual hobbies, similar values, mutual dreams for the future, memories the couple have together, matching music taste and of course sex. The more they find in common in each other the more points they get.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds by players placing tiles on the board. Both the tiles and game board have symbols for these 8 things that relationships can consist of and players try to match the symbols on tiles to those in game board.&#10;&#10;However every tile also holds an evil promise. A chance for mistrust, a black heart that represents all the bad things in relationships. As player's tiles approach one another these black hearts become both something that jepardise your own relationship, but those of others too. If two black hearts are placed next to one another, then the one that was there first gets turned 45 degrees. If it can't do that or gets disconnected from the structure the tile is removed and relationship just lost some of its charm. In other words the way you place those black hearts at the beginning of the game can matter a lot. You need to build your relationship to withstand the bad times &ndash; make it into something so strong that even when shaked, it won't break.&#10;&#10;There is also Agenda -cards that can alter the strategy each players has. In the end the player who has the most perfect love life will win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game rats in 2 to 6 colors (from the movies Macskafog&oacute; - Cat City - and Macskafog&oacute; 2.) race on the board (one player has 2 or 3 rats of the same color and type). First they have to collect casino tokens and then go to the five face-up canasta cards (showing scenes from the second movie) to collect them for tokens. On their way they can also use rat-holes for faster travel. In the easier version (for smaller children) number of steps is determined by dice rolling, in the 'heavier version' players choose from their 6 movement cards (and after 6 rounds they can use all of these movement cards again). In the easier version you get points for tokens (different tokens have different value) and for collected cards (cards with cats have a higher value than other cards). In the heavier version you bid for the cards you have come at, and score for the cards' value and extra points for pairs and trios...&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.macskafogojatek.hu/ (Hungarian)&#10;&#10;",

Art for this expansion is by Klemens Franz, the same artist who did the work for Agricola.&#10;&#10;The aliens arrive when the players create a Quarry; that is, when the &quot;1 Stone&quot; card from Stage II of the game (Rounds 5-7) is revealed. Whenever a player takes this action, they also draw the top card from the Alien Encounter Deck (X Deck). (Note that this does not apply to the &quot;1 Stone&quot; card that appears during Stage IV (Rounds 10-11).) Of course, you also take any Stone that is on the space.&#10;&#10;An English edition of this expansion has been available directly from Lookout Games and can be obtained by donating to a fundraiser via PayPal.

If an area has one or more gaps, it is considered &ldquo;under siege&rdquo; until all of the gaps are filled.&#10;Each tile will generally have one or more special symbols on the tile. Adding three commander (red flag) symbols to one&rsquo;s kingdom will trigger a round of attack.

The first player picks the plan the villain wants accomplished, and then the players play henchmen to try to complete the mission. They commit henchman to resolve the evil plan. Players take one henchman card from their hand and commit it face down. These henchmen form the mission pool. &#10;All Players Simultaneously Reveal Henchmen in the Mission Pool. All the better to determine which henchmen to undermine &hellip; er &hellip; help&hellip; during subterfuge. Players Play Subterfuge Cards. These cards can help and hinder in the efforts. Then you see whether the plan worked. If the plan succeeded, then the highest unique number on the henchmen will count for points (be promoted to the back office). &#10;You repeat till 3 rounds or a doomsday plan has been completed. If a doomsday plan was enacted, then the player whose henchman made it succeed is ineligible for victory.&#10;Each eligible player totals up the henchman value for all henchmen promoted to the back office.

Players are placed &quot;on the table&quot; and granted wide historical latitude to control their units.&#10;&#10;The rules sequence features both simultaneous and alternate actions, resulting in an intuitive and balanced game that captures the feel of the period strongly. Individual units represented are the battalion and regiment and players can do sub-unit actions such as company and squadron actions. Players can use any basing system and the default scale is 1:50, but players can use any ratio such as 1:20 or 1:60.&#10;&#10;It is a game that replicates the tactics of the period and enables gamers to play the period and not get bogged down in complex rules! The game can also be adapted for other Horse and Musket periods from the SYW to the Crimea War.&#10;&#10;The game will appeal to players who enjoy tactical nuance and want a game that grows with them in subtlety and tactical complexity. &Eacute;lan is written in a clear, concise style. The rules are well indexed, logically laid out and easy to comprehend.  The PDF file also has bookmarks for ease of navigation and players can print out just the sections that interest them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Downward Spiral is a sole survivor board game, developed by researchers at the Institute of Behavioral Research at Texas Christian University.  The game provides substance abuse counselors with an innovative way to motivate clients and open up discussions about the consequences of addiction on themselves and their families.  In a game format that resembles the well-known Monopoly&trade;, players roll dice to move across a board filled with potential downfalls related to family, health, friendships, finances and self-esteem, which are described on game cards that players draw.  The objective of the game is to stay alive, without losing all social and financial resources due to substance abuse -- a task that becomes more challenging the longer the player stays in the game.&#10;&#10;The Downward Spiral game focuses on the consequences of substance abuse on a person&rsquo;s family, finances, self-esteem, health, legal status, and life expectancy (or lack thereof).  Each player takes the role of a person who continues to abuse drugs throughout his/her lifetime.  The last player left &ldquo;alive&rdquo; in the game &ldquo;wins.&rdquo;  The game uses vignettes as well as facts and quotes to emphasize the consequences amassed in the game.  An after-game discussion helps focus the players on issues that have surfaced during play.&#10;&#10;More information can be found here: http://www.ibr.tcu.edu/pubs/trtmanual/downwardspiral.html&#10;&#10;",

The optimum amount of time allotted to play is four hours to ensure proper facilitation and personal engagement, but the game can be played in a minimum of three hours. The goal is to achieve &quot;enlightenment.&quot; To do this, the active participants move their pawns around the game board and respond to statements on the playing cards. After a set period of time, the two groups switch roles. At the end of the game, all players participate in a reflection and group discussion period to synthesize the game experience for each participant.&#10;&#10;More information can be found here: https://www.naspa.org/publications/books/the-game-of-oppression&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;The decisive naval battle of the Napoleonic era occurred when a British fleet of 27 ships under the commander of Admiral Horatio Nelson engaged a Franco-Spanish fleet of 33 ships. Nelson devised a daring strategy to overcome his opponents. He divided his force into two squadrons, which attacked the center of the Allied fleet at right angles. Nelson led one of the squadrons into action aboard the Victory. The plan was a smashing success. The Allied fleet was crushed, losing twenty ships. The British didn't lose any ships, but a French sniper killed Nelson. This battle ended forever Napoleon's dream of invading Britain, and the Royal Navy would dominate the seas for the next century.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table. Free print-and-play paper miniatures (flats) are provided for use with the rules. The rules cover fouling, grappling, boarding, cannon fire, drifting, and wind effects. &#10; Colored yarn is taped around the edges of the game table to give a quick visual guide to the effect of the wind based on the color a ship is facing. &ldquo;If the ship is pointing towards the green then the wind is behind the ship . . . If the ship is pointing towards the yellow it is close quartered . . . If a ship is pointing towards the red then it is &lsquo;locked in irons&rsquo;&rdquo; and must pass a skill roll to move.&#10;&#10;",

These games are designed to be fast and furious, easy to learn, and to play but with enough historical research to make them true to the history.&#10;&#10;Benevento, 1266&#10;The battle of Benevento is one of the most important battles of the long, vicious struggle of strength between the Papacy and the Ghibellin dynasty of the Hohenstaufen family. After the death of Frederic II, King of the Two Sicilies his bastard son, Manfredi d&rsquo;Altavilla, raised an army against Pope Clement IV. After a fierce battle, Manfredi was defeated and died in battle. He was made immortal by Dante Alighieri, who put him in Purgatory and said of him &ldquo;Biondo era, e bello, e di nobile aspetto&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Tagliacozzo, 1268&#10;This battle may be considered the end of the Ghibellines, with the defeat of the last heir of the Hohenstaufen family, Conradin of Svabia. Similar to the earlier battle of Beneventor, it was mostly a clash of knights, resolved by the cunning of Charles of Anjou, who was not reluctant to sacrifice two-thirds of his army to surprise the Ghibellins who thought they had already won the battle before it was even fought (and acted accordingly).&#10;&#10;Originally, available only as print &amp; play through Wargamesdownloads.com.&#10;A second edition was published by High Flying Dice Games. The rules were extensively re-written for clarity and bring into compliance with the other games in the Battles of the Middle Ages Series. The Benevento game has a new variant scenario. In addition, the second edition features new artwork&#10;&#10;",

It was originally titled Statis Pro Championship Racing and was distributed thru Midwest Research/Statis Pro Publishing for one year.  The Game was renamed Thoroughbred Racing and distributed thru Tabletop Sports and currently thru ASG Games where it is still available for purchase.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to give a maximum amount of realism, while emphasizing ease of play. A race can easily be run in 15 minutes, but the method of recording the moves gives a chart of the race that is as detailed as those in the Daily Racing Form. The basic rules are simple, and can be understood by anyone who has played any table top sports game.&#10;&#10;The First Edition of the game utilized a 6x6 grid to determine horse speed results which was changed in the second edition to 2-12 die role results.  The horse tracks remained the same.&#10;&#10;ASG Games currently publishes a paper and computer version of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Someone must take on the role of Khalifa, leading the faith. Can you unite the squabbling clans, pummel the Persians, beat back the Byzantines and unite the Arabian Peninsula?&#10;&#10;More importantly, can you do it in spite of the other players?&#10;&#10;Since only six of the first twelve Khalifa died of natural causes, there are frequent openings for the position. Based on historical events and people, winning takes strategy, diplomacy, and an occasional bit of treachery. The game is notable in that it has both English and Arabic-native versions, making it one of very few US games designed expressely for an Arabic-speaking audience.&#10;&#10;The game includes 120 cards, quick-start rules, full rule book with historical details on the people, places and events of the time (632 CE), reference map and player aid sheet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players are astronauts trying to find out and get as many super-crystals from Super-crystals galaxy as possible. They start from their space stations and and travel through the stars following the number obtained on the dice (from 2 to 6). Additionally, a space shuttle travels into the galaxy and it is moved every time the dice shows its figure (corresponding to number 1). When a player lands on a star containing a chip he must turn it out: if the chip shows a super-crystal the player take it. The players should bring as many crystals as possible back to their space stations before the space shuttle reach the galaxy. However, the chip can show no crystal but a monster, a crystal-breaker. In this case, the astronaut rolls the dice to fight against the monster, which power corresponds to the number of its teeth. If the player wins, he captures the crystal-breaker and can bring it to his station as his prisoner. If the monster wins, all crystals owned by the player and still not safe in his station are put on this field and become property of the monster. These crystals can be recovered by a player who defeat the monster in another battle. The game ends when the spaceship arrives at the galaxy and the winner is the player who has the majority of the points given by the values of crystals and the amount of monster teeth he has brought to his start station.&#10;&#10;",

Both similar sounding slogans stand for completely different concepts deciding which turn America&rsquo;s policy will take in the future. &#10;&middot;    The Democrats and Republicans are divided by a deep gap of controversial political concepts. The economy, the war in Iraq, America&rsquo;s dependence on oil imports, alternative energy concepts, and other major events which shaped the actual campaign are represented in a card driven game system. &#10;&middot;    In For President 2008 you take the role of Team Obama or Team McCain.

Both teams can campaign in each state or make federal campaigns affecting national opinion. For President 2008 puts an emphasis on the battleground states that may decide the outcome of the elections. As with the real election, the challenge is to adapt your campaign strategy as the ground shifts beneath your feet.

    "Description": "Ddak-ji is a popular Korean childrens game played using specially made cardboard disks.  The disks resemble Pogs but are perhaps thinner and slightly curved.  Unlike the games played using Pogs, Ddak-ji uses no 'slammer' piece.  Only the ddakji themselves are used.&#10;&#10;In the basic version of the game the throwing player is chosen by 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' and the losing player places their disk on the table.  The active player throws their disk down on it in an attempt to make the inactive player's disk flip over.  The curvature of the disks makes finesse an important part of the technique.  If a disk is flipped, the player who flipped it gets to keep it.  Variants of this play style exist.&#10;&#10;The modern disks are decorated with pictures of characters from popular culture (TV, animation and video game characters are extremely popular).&#10;&#10;Modern ddakji is the descendant of an older game that was adopted from Japanese culture.  In Japan special illustrated cards (Cf. 'menko'), similar to modern sports cards, were thrown down in an attempt to flip and claim the cards.  The old Korean version that descended from this was played with handmade folded paper or pasteboard squares.&#10;&#10;The early history of Ddak-ji in Korea is briefly mentioned in Lee E-Wha's History of Korea, Vol. 14:&#10;&#10;&quot;in addition to these games, there was a slap-match (ddakji chigi) which came from Japan in the nineteenth century.  The goal of this game was to flip the pasteboard card (ddakji) on the ground by slapping it with another pasteboard card.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Just outside the limits of the Dutch settlement of Tarrytown, New York, an old Church stands in view of a burying ground surrounded by humble homes, a school and a covered bridge. The year is 1792, and only a decade earlier this secluded glen was the scene of a grisly battle during the American Revolution where a Hessian soldier lost his head to a stray cannonball. Since that fateful day the residents of Sleepy Hollow live in fear of nightfall when the Headless Horseman returns and &lsquo;rides forth to the scene of battle in a nightly quest of his head.&rsquo;&#10;&#10;Sleepy Hollow is based on the legendary tale of Sleepy Hollow as penned by Washington Irving in 1820. During the game players control residents of Sleepy Hollow, recently shaken by the disappearance of Ichabod Crane, now living in fear that the Headless Horseman will come for them.  Game play is divided into the 10 days leading up to All Hallows Eve, each separated into day and night. During the day, the residents move freely about the glen, finding a safe place to hide before nightfall. At night, the Horseman makes rounds in the village killing residents where they hide. &#10;    &#10;Each building gives players distinct benefits, but also distinct criterion dictating who is killed if targeted by the Horseman. Sometimes it is wisest to risk leaving yourself exposed, other times it is safer to stay hidden. By the time the sun rises on All Hallows Day, the player with the most points and fewest fatalities wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fantasy Rules! Tournament &amp; Campaign Edition is a simplified version of Fantasy Rules! Fast Play Rules for Miniature Wargames in the Worlds of Fantasy 3rd edition.  While the latter weighs in at over 130 pages, the TCE is less than 40 pages.  The goal of the game is to remove many of the more elaborate constructs such as burrowing creatures, battlewagons, high magic levels, and elaborate army lists, and allow players to focus on the core rules so that they can play quick games as part of a tournament and campaign.  The mechanics of the game is basically the same--it's just a much slimmed down version with a lot fewer options.&#10;&#10;Although FR!TCE is designed to be compatible with FR!3, it is in some respects a very different game. All Chipco games rely on a balance between units, magic (in FR!), characters and missile fire. Every unit/character has its vulnerability. In simplifying the game for extremely fast play, we have abstracted or eliminated many of the high-level magic, capabilities, and units.&#10;&#10;Features of FR!TCE include:&#10;&#10;* A Grand tactical, historical-based system that rewards sound military tactics.&#10;    * Fast play; designed to play in an hour for easy compatiblity with your tournaments and campaigns.&#10;    * A Simplified but satisfying magic system; magic is not just an artillery hit.&#10;    * There are no restrictive army lists, but rather a system focusing on an army or nation's core strengths that you can use to ensure the army fits your concept.&#10;    * A campaign system that lets character/units level up with experience in battle.&#10;    * Based on Chipco's Fantasy Rules!; a vetted and well tested system.&#10;&#10;Fantasy Rules! Tournament and Campaign Edition (FR!TCE) differs from the standard FR!3 ruleset in the following manner:&#10;&#10;* The Morale Clock starts at 7.&#10;    * Capabilities diminish when the clock reaches 3.&#10;    * No unit RF/CF can be raised by magic or character bonuses by more than +2. Only rank and file units can have a magic or character RF/CF bonus, not Special units (except Large Monsters, when ridden).&#10;    * Large Monsters (including dragons and leviathans) and Spirits usually require a pip to move (unless ridden).&#10;    * There is only one simplified level of magic.&#10;    * The character system has also been simplified, with some differences from FR!3. Note: These new concepts are compatible with FR!3 (for example, you might wish to use the FR!3 TCE Witch Hunter capabilities instead of the original FR!3 ones).&#10;    * FR!3 optional rules are not part of FR!TCE, and unit/character lists have been streamlined.&#10;    * There are no specific army lists. Instead, we have sixteen Army Focuses; these are special character and unit core competencies in which an armies/races/civilizations might specialize. Each army picks 3-4. For example, if the Orcs in your world are noble knights or steppe riders, then you can set up the lists to accomodate.&#10;    * There is a hierarchy of units (raised, regular, veteran, and elite) to simulate campaign experience (for example, Mounted are raised, Heavy Cavalry are regular, and Knights, Light Cavalry, and Heavy Chariots are veteran).&#10;&#10;FR!TCE is designed to be played in under an hour since fast, simple play is essential for conventions, campaigns and tournaments, evening play, or to just have a simplified game to introduce beginners to miniature wargame rules. In doing so, we have not sacrificed tactics, skill, or interesting variety; our players get to fight the battle, not the rules. FR!3 and FR!TCE are designed for use with 10mm, 15mm, or 25mm armies.&#10;&#10;These rules are designed to be used in the fantasy or mythical world of your choice, not one that we have designed. All Chipco games emphasize playing with whatever armies or figures you have already, and FR!TCE is no exception.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In June 1944, the Russian High Command decided to knock Finland out of the war with an offensive designed to ultimately reach Helsinki. On paper, the Red force allocations seemed to guarantee victory by 4 to 1 and more. Hundreds of tanks, artillery and aircraft were opposed by weak Finnish forces, many of them at only 50% strength. Only a few Finnish divisions opposed over 15 Red divisions at full strength.The Finns were clearly worried and rightly so, as when the Red offensive began in late June, one Finnish defensive line crumbled after another! The only equalizer was the terrain mostly of forests and lakes. The few key roads channeled any offensive plans. By the 28th of June, the Finns had already sounded the SOS call to the Germans for help. Hitler sent in the Luftwaffe, StG 303, and hundreds of Panzerfausts and Panzerschrecks. The Red steamroller stalled, started and inched closely to Ihantala, the last Finn defenses. When July arrived, Ihantala was threatened. The Finns were close to collapse-but would they?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dai Hasami Shogi is a variant of Hasami Shogi. It is played on a 9x9 grid, traditionally on a shogi board. The word dai mean large and the name is apt because this game uses twice as many pieces as Hasami Shogi, 18 per player placed initially on the two back rows nearest the player controlling those pieces. The two sides are called sente [&quot;black&quot;] and gote [&quot;white&quot;], as in shogi, with sente moving first. Traditionally, Go-stones are used for the pieces.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture all of an opponents' pieces or to have captured more pieces than one's opponent if a situation arises in which additional captures are no longer possible. All pieces move like rooks is chess, i.e., in any uninterrupted vertical or horizontal line in any obstructed direction without jumping. Pieces are taken by custodial capture, i.e., when an enemy piece becomes horizontally or vertically sandwiches between two of a player's own pieces. One of the two pieces bracketing the captured piece must be moved in order to capture but multiple simultaneous captured are allowed.&#10;&#10;The game is a member of the petteia or lantruculorum family of games. A similar game is played in Thailand and in , where respectively it is called Mak-yes and Apit-sodok; this game differs only in that the second row of pieces starts on the third rather than the second row.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Britain Stands Alone 2nd Edition simulates one of the greatest &quot;what ifs&quot; of all of history, the German invasion of Great Britain.  Historically, the RAF won the Battle, and Adolf Hitler called off the invasion, sending his forces east in a fateful decision to attack the Soviet Union in 1941. In Britain Stands Alone, players are under no compulsion to repeat this, and instead the decisive campaign of World War II will take place on the shores of the United Kingdom.&#10;&#10;Since the map covers all of England, and not just the historically-planned invasion beaches around Dover, the players have enormous freedom to explore other possibilities. Would East Anglia be a better landing site than Kent? Or the West Country? Maybe the Germans would want to make a direct attempt to seize the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth? All of these possibilities, and many more, are within the scope of Britain Stands Alone.&#10;&#10;In addition, Britain Stands Alone comes with a wealth of further variants. The Germans might have enhanced naval forces, such as the famed battleship Bismarck joining the Kriegsmarine a year early, or the Germans might have lost fewer torpedo boats and destroyers in the previous campaign for Norway.  Maybe instead of using nothing but jerry rigged river and canal boats for landing craft, Germany manages to develop purpose-built boats similar to the LCT's employed by the Allies in World War II. On the British side, there are variants for greater Free French involvement, including by elements of the French navy, more arms from the Americans, and more tanks.&#10;&#10;The original edition of Britain Stands Alone, published by GMT Games, remains popular, yet is now out of print.  The Lock 'n Load Publishing edition will not be a straight reprint, but a major upgrade of a title already held in high regard.  Players can look forward to incorporation of all errata to date, fresh development, additional validation of all systems, and even more variants.&#10;&#10;",
