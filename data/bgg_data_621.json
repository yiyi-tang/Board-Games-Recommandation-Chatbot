    "Description": "Olsen Banden: De 14 Kup (The Olsen Gang: The 14 Heists) is based on a series of comedy movies about a gang of robbers who always try to score the big coup and flee to Mallorca, Spain, but in the end they (almost) always fail.&#10;&#10;These films were from Denmark, and were a big success in Germany in the 70's and 80's as well.&#10;&#10;This game allows you to recreate any of their 14 heists, while following the plot from the movies, allowing you to capture the atmosphere and humor from these films.&#10;&#10;Players will move around the gameboard while visiting famous locations from the movie series, in an attempt to gather the tools to commit the heists, commit them, and ultimately escape to Mallorca with the loot.&#10;&#10;But, beware! The other players are able to move the villains &quot;B&oslash;ffen&quot; (The Beef) and &quot;Kommiss&aelig;ren&quot; (The Detective) around the map, in order to stop the other player's advancement in the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players have to guess where Mausi is hanging for the day, winning the card on which she's located if they do. Be the first to reveal cards with all five friends on them and you win.&#10;&#10;The short description: Each player has five cards depicting the animal friends, and these are shuffled and placed face-down before the player. On a turn, the player rolls the die, flips an animal card in front of her, and hopes it shows the animal on the die; if so, the card stays revealed; if not, the card is flipped face-down again. Roll an animal that's already revealed, and you can flip a card of your choice. Roll the moon, and one of the timing cards is flipped. The game ends when one player finds all five friends or time runs out, in which case no one wins.&#10;&#10;How to play Wo Ist Mausi?:&#10;&#10;- The six-Mausi cards with the page &quot;Mausi comes home&quot; to the top placed in the middle of the table. &#10;- Each player is dealt five cards with the same animal back color and places them with the back upwards before him. &#10;- Whoever's turn it is throws an animal that needs to turn one of his cards. If it is he animal rolles on the die, the card is exposed. &#10;- If there is a different animal, the card will once again be face down. &#10;-The dice shows the moon is one of the six cards on the side of Mausi, &quot;Mausi sleeps&quot; reversed. &#10;- The dice shows an animal that the player has already found, nothing happens. &#10;- Winner is the person who discovered the first five friends of Mausi on his maps. &#10;-When Erica is sleeping all six cards on the page &quot;Mausi&quot; lie, there is no winner.&#10;&#10;",

The magnets of each team are polarised in reverse, so you cannot move your opponents players with your rod. The rod is used to drag your players across the board, thus allowing you to push the ball around.&#10;&#10;The game board is a smooth hardboard surface, marked out with a football pitch, and a basic raised surround to stop the ball going out of play.&#10;&#10;Magnetic football is excellent fun - a splendid ice breaker at parties and games evenings - and requires a surprising amount of skill. If you move the players too fast, or use too much power, then it is very easy to leave either the player or the ball behind! Although you cannot control your opponent's players, your reversed magnet can be used to flip them over.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game from the Ahoy Series by Edmund Vale.  This is a game of Privateers vs. Spanish Galleons.  The Galleons, one carrying the Treasure, are attempting to deliver it to their home port while the Privateers are attempting to capture the gold.  All ships have equal speed, strength and vulnerability.&#10;&#10;The game is based around the map, which shows wind direction in each diamond as well as ports, forts (gray areas with letters and gold triangles), calm areas (diamonds containing blue sea serpents), sandbars(yellow diamonds), dry land (gray diamonds), ice flows (icebergs in the diamond) and coral reefs (orange diamonds).  The ships move around the map based on the wind direction and are really only limited to changes in wind direction and decisions to change ship direction.  Chance only comes into play when you move on to a calm area, the teetotum is then used to determine whether the wind comes up.&#10;&#10;A ship is given 6 wooden beads at the beginning of the game to represent its strength.  Loss of beads due to difficult maneuvers, combat or running aground can lead to &quot;disablement&quot; which takes away some of the ability to change directions during your turn.  A second disablement (loss of 4 beads) means the ship can only move 1 square a turn.&#10;&#10;In Combat Privateers shoot on the N/S/E/W lines (diagonals) and the Galleons shoot NE/NW/SE/SW down the rows.  Each ship can fire up to 2 space away and Combat includes the concept of Leeway, drifting on the tide as combat occurs, leading to some chance as a players ship may run aground or collide with another.  Ships can be boarded and even attacked by the forts shown on the map.&#10;&#10;This is a game of maneuver where advanced planning is key and the effects of tide and wind drive the game.&#10;&#10;An outstanding example of Naval Miniatures play from the 1930s.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players play from a hand of cards which have creatures with attributes that are based on the properties of the elements on the periodic table. Each player is trying to collect the largest army, there is no actual fighting in the base game but this is planed for adding into future expansions.&#10;The top card of the draw pile is turned over, and each player tried to win that card to their army by playing a card from their hand that can match to that card and also using their standard multiplier cards that they can keep and reuse in the game. The winning player, which is determined by the actually chemical reactivity printed on the card, adds wining pair of cards to his army, and the loser takes the card they played back into their hand. The winner then draws back their hand to starting number and reveals the next card off the draw deck to win.&#10;When the entire draw deck is emptied players can attempt to combine cards from their had and if that is possible can then add them to their army. The winner is the player with the largest army.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;The ELEMENTAURS were originally created as nanorobots but through a fortuitous accident in a bioreactor these synthesised beings took on a life of their own. They are living beings who have much to offer the human race. They can teach us many things, give us gifts, help us solve problems and defeat our enemies. Neither good nor bad, tame nor wild, they take on some of the personality of the human who releases them.&#10;&#10;ELEMENTAURS BOOT CAMP is an exciting new card game with adventures on a subatomic level. In this game you meet the first eighteen of the ELEMENTAURS. You learn which clans they belong to, how they might behave and, most importantly, how to recruit them to your team.&#10;&#10;ELEMENTAURS BOOT CAMP may be played at many different levels, depending on the age and ability of the players. From the simplest games through to the challenging COMBAT COMBOS there is something for everyone. And after the games are played, just looking at the cards is an enlightening experience. There is much to be learned and laughed about in the images and text on each of the cards as you decide which is your favourite ELEMENTAUR.&#10;&#10;This starter deck is just the beginning as there are 92 ELEMENTAUR creatures to meet. Soon the next series of 18 will be released along with enemy, challenge and rare cards in packs of 10. There is also a series of books that will be published telling about the creation of the ELEMENTAURS and the adventures of a group of children in their quest to release them.&#10;&#10;",

By having the most political influence in a country, a player controls its government and may use its economic, diplomatic, and military resources to crush his enemies. But alas, rival factions wait in the shadows, ready to seize power. Push your citizens too far, and you might find yourself in front of a firing squad.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player may either 1) play an event card or 2) activate a country. Each player has a fixed set of event cards, allowing him to manipulate the geo-political landscape throughout the game in a myriad of ways. When a country is activated, the governing party can improve the economy, call for diplomatic sanctions, raise an army, engage in political maneuvering, seek international influence, and more. Rival parties have a chance to oppose every action, so unpopular actions may come with a heavy price.&#10;&#10;After each country is activated once, the regions are scored. The game ends when every country has a representative in the League of Nations, a player reaches a certain number of victory points, or a party rules a certain number of countries.&#10;&#10;This luckless game was inspired by eggertspiele's &quot;not-quite-politically-correct game of tactics, agitation, and plenty of interaction,&quot; Global Powers.&#10;&#10;",

The other two local (but of nationwide fame) artists whose songs the musical is based on are Juice Leskinen, and the band Popeda.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is for each player to try and complete three random tasks around the city, collecting stuff needed to throw a bachelor party for Palle, who's getting married with Karoliina. The game is set in the city of Tampere in the year 1985, and is naturally full of references to the city, it's vibrant rock music scene, and the '80s culture in Finland in general. For example, the two special vehicles with their own playing pieces present in the game are a Datsun 100A compact car and a Solifer Suzuki moped, and one of the tasks is to get 10 kilos of black sausage (a local delicacy) while another is to obtain a portable VHS player for the party.&#10;&#10;There are six different characters, based on the characters of the musical, with unique starting points and their own little characteristics such as the ability to call a taxi anywhere with a Mobira Cityman mobile phone, or get on/off a bus at any point in a bus-line.&#10;&#10;The first player who succesfully completes three tasks and returns to the central market wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each tile also has three round spots; on such a spot a pawn can be placed, some of these spots are yellow, white, green or orange. Each player uses four wooden pawns to play on the board (a white or a black set). The condition to move one of the pawns to another spot is that it has to be free and a green or orange color. During a game turn a player can either exchaneg a tile on the board, move his pawn to a green or orange spot or move a tile with an opponent's pawn on, in that case that pawn has to start again in the back row.&#10;&#10;The objective to win is to reach the last row of the opponent's side with all four pawns.&#10;&#10;",

If they land on a different color they have to take a trivia card and if they answer the question correctly they may also take a puzzle piece. When they land with their pawn on an exchange space they have to exchange one of their puzzle pieces with an opponents piece. The player who finishes his puzzle first wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

This unique Sudoku can be played solitaire or as a family game for up to 4 people, each with his/her own gameboard. Due to the handicap system kids could beat their parents. Furthermore each game can be played with numbers aswell as colors.&#10;&#10;Additional info:&#10;&#10;In the normal game, each of the players get his/her own sudoku board. A card showing an initial setup is drawn. All players start with the same setup by placing tokens (numbers or colors) on their own boards as shown on the setup card. Next, each player tries to finish his own sudoku as quickly as possible. The fastest player of the first round has to play the next round with the highest handicap, the slowest player with the lowest handicap. The different handicap levels are shown on the setup cards. Winner is the player that manages to be the first to complete his/her own sudoku board.&#10;&#10;Then there's the Sudoku Sandokan type of play. In this variant, all players play on the same board. The goal is to get the board as full as possible. At first an initial setup is made based on what's shown on a setup card that is randomly drawn. The remaining tokens are then divided between the players. Each turn has to timed, so that each players has to place one or two of his tokens on a correct position on the board within half a minute. Failing to place a token correctly within the allotted time means that the player has to discard one of his tokens. A player scores a single point upon completing a single row, column or block. Completing two items (row+column, row+block or column+block) with a single token gives 2 points. Completing all three (row+column+block) with a single tile scores 3 points. The player with the most points wins the game&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;4 boards&#10;324 double-sided pieces with colors and numbers&#10;50 cards with 100 startup situations (at 4 different levels)&#10;Rules (in 6 languages)&#10;&#10;",

Here's more about the characters in this game from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;He'll huff and puff 'till he gets his way...and if that doesn't work, maybe his great big teeth will! The Big Bad Wolf has even convinced those boarish Little Pigs to join his malevolent side. She's and over-worked, over-stressed girl on the brink who's had it up to here, plus Cinderella has her Fairy Godmother looking over her shoulder. They're both crazy for power, but which has the strongest will and resources to rule the Land?&quot;&#10;&#10;The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom in which a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&#10;&#10;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy, comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.&#10;&#10;",

Now the children roll the die and they may remove a sheep every round but the sheep may only be removed if the number that the sheep is standing on is the same as the die roll. This way the game becomes a memory game. The child who obtains the most cheep wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game for 2 to 6 players on the now legendary 'Great Train Robbery'. On the 8th August, 1963 the travelling post office train was hijacked at Sears Crossing, Buckinghamshire, England. The train driver and co-driver were captured and the train driven a quarter of a mile to a bridge over the road. The mail vans were ransacked by the gang and the 110 mail bags were thrown down to a waiting lorry. The gang then went to Leatherslade Farm, their base for the share out. This was only 20 miles from the hold up.&#10;&#10;Based on the actual events of the Great Train Robbery in 1963, this game is a realistic re-enactment of the chase making use of skill, judgement, initative and like life itself, a measure of luck.&#10;&#10;",

If you complete a row, you get to draw a coin from the bag to see which treasure you&rsquo;ve won!

    "Description": "There are strange things going on in your basement laboratories. They keep calling up for more barrels of quicksilver, or bits of your hair. Well it's all in the name of progress. They're looking for a way to turn lead into gold, or at least into something better than lead. That lead had just been too good of a bargain to pass up; you didn't think, where will I put all this lead, what am I going to do with this lead anyway. Well that will all be sorted out. They're also looking for a universal solvent. If they manage that one, you will take whatever they use to hold it in and build a castle out of it. A castle that can't be dissolved! Now that's progress.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Alchemy is an expansion, and can't be played by itself; to play with it, you need Dominion a standalone expansion to Dominion (Dominion: Intrigue), or Dominion Base Cards . Those provide the Basic cards you need to play (Treasure, Victory, and Curse cards), as well as the full rules for setup and gameplay. Dominion: Alchemy can also be combined with any other Dominion expansions you have.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;",
