    "Description": "In each of the three rounds of Secret Squad, all players are secretly assigned a color squad, either red or yellow. To start the round, a card is revealed that has a yes/no question in red and a different yes/no question in yellow. All players answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the question corresponding to their secret color by placing a token on the &quot;Yup&quot; or &quot;Nope&quot; end of the card. Two other cards are then revealed, with players answering them in the same way.&#10;&#10;Using these clues, you want to identify someone &mdash; anyone! &mdash; who's on your squad. Everyone raises a finger, and on the count of three, you point at someone who seems like a good fit. (In a three-player game, you might be alone, and if you think you are, you point at yourself.) Everyone then reveals their squad affiliation, and if you guessed correctly, you score points; you also score if someone correctly identified you as being part of their squad.&#10;&#10;You then reshuffle the squad cards and play another round. Whoever has the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;This is an English-language update of the German game #no secrets.&#10;&#10;",

As this is made from solid wood with working wooden trains, it doesn't make for the most portable filler.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Have you ever smashed your best friend with a Full House? Crushed a foe with a Flush? Made your mate irate with a pair of 8s? The game you thought you knew has been reimagined as a game of combat, crafting killer hands, decisive moments, and non-stop fun with every turn of the cards!&#10;&#10;In Poker Assault, take control of the mysterious and maniacal Invaders, the ferocious and unrelenting Wolf Pack, the elegant and vicious Vampire Court, or the heroic aeronautical aces of the Rocket Patrol. Each team has its own custom suit theme and artwork. Play any deck versus any other deck, or even three- and four-player variants. While each deck is a legal 52-card poker deck, it's also so much more! Several cards in each deck have bonus abilities that can aid you while assaulting your opponent or defending against an assault. Additionally, if you can craft a Straight, Flush, Full House, or Four-of-a-Kind, you will earn an aptly named Power Card. These unique cards give you new strategies to pursue.&#10;&#10;Chances are with your initial hand of five cards, you aren't going to have much of a poker hand. But by playing only one card at a time, and drawing a new card from your deck after each play, you can slowly build up to something great. How great is up to how risky you want to get. Craft a hand of at least a pair, and your assault is underway! Now your opponent must block your cards using the cards in their hand. The defending player likewise plays only one card at a time and draws a card from their deck after each play. To block an assaulting card, match the value (2 to Ace) or play a card of the same suit (Heart, Diamond, Club, Spade), but with a higher value. Each assaulting card that gets through knocks your opponent's hit points down by one. Bring your opponent's health to zero and you win!&#10;&#10;",

It&acute;s goal is to form the most famous and rich group of Adventurers in the 4 Reigns. Characters can be of any 4 classes (warrior=Earth, Thief=Air, Cleric=Water and Mage=Fire), based on the 4 elements of Alchemy, or combinations of that classes. The game is a sandbox, so there are many types of actions that can be played at every turn: They can search for missions, rumours, adventures, slay wandering monsters, quest for artifacts, craft magical itens, upgrade their characters, travel through the Reigns, explore dungeons and other actions.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, the group will meet friends, acquire new artifacts, meet some of the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot and become more powerful, so they can face their Ultimate Nemesis.&#10;&#10;The game is based on Victory Points, so it can vary from 30 minutes to a whole afternoon or even more, if you choose the Campaing Mode.&#10;&#10;",

The special weapons and abilities of the contending races give this game a unique flavor.&#10;&#10;Rulebook Excerpts&#10;&#10;The conflict begins as players build armadas of Starships to conquer worlds. The player's purpose in Space Empires is the imposition of his form of government on other alien races and to gather new allies in the conquest of the known universe...&#10;&#10;A player wins the game by controlling seven or more races for two consecutive victory phases . . .

Any other result is a draw.&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;A relatively simple hex-and-counter game of space conquest in a galactic zone populated by twelve alien races. Players seek to expand their control over the star systems scattered across the map. This increases the player's production capabilities which allows more starships to be built.&#10;&#10;The interesting twist, sort of a Cosmic Encounters &quot;lite,&quot; is that each alien race has a special ability. When a player conquers the home world of an alien race, the player can then start building starships for that race. The special powers of the alien starships include the paralyzing ray of the Amoebas, the Gort repulsion field generator, Parasite energy absorption, and the cloaking device of the Slinkers.&#10;&#10;",

To do that, you will spend silver to bid against other rulers on worker cards which produce unique goods or services for your kingdom. You will need to balance your silver and grain economies, and take some risks. The primary risk-reward comes in the form of FAMINE cards, which show up with increasing regularity as the game progresses. You can store as much of your grain as you wish to safety for a single silver coin. This makes it economically beneficial to leave your grain growing as long as possible. But beware! When FAMINE strikes, you will lose half of it!&#10;&#10;Variable player powers are built in with six rulers. Each ruler gives a unique power to their kingdom. Rulers can be distributed randomly at the start or chosen by each player for the cost of less starting silver.&#10;&#10;If all else fails and you think an opposing ruler is running away with the game, you may be able to slow them with judiciously played evil wizard cards, although each wizard will cost a precious spot in your kingdom!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

(Toire o Yogoshita nowa Dareda) in English means 'Who Soiled the Toilet?'&#10;&#10;Who Soiled the Toilet? is a deduction game with hidden identities. The game box is 15cm round, not square. The game is published in Japanese with rules available in English, German and French.&#10;&#10;At beginning of the game, each player is dealt one secret identity card, which is either a clean keeper or a soiler. They play five rounds. The soilers win the game if the toilet is soiled three times out of these five rounds. Otherwise the clean keepers win.&#10;&#10;A round is either a regular round or an action round. In a regular round, a leader sends a certain number of players to the toilet in order. The toilet is initially clean (clean side of the toilet card is up), but when a soiler enters the toilet, that player may soil the toilet, secretly flipping the toilet card to dirty-side-up. After all designated players are done, The toilet card is revealed to all players. Soilers win the round if the toilet is dirty. Players should discuss and deduce who are the soilers.&#10;&#10;In an action round, place the toilet bowl (the game box) on the table, and players take turns trying to throw a poo chip into the toilet bowl from two-card length away. The clean keepers win the round if a certain number of poo chips are in the toilet bowl. Otherwise the soilers win that round. Players should discuss who missed the throw intentionally.&#10;&#10;It is recommended the toilet card be placed on an actual toilet because it adds more reality and laughter to players' conversation. To do so, keep the toilet clean, of course!&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#182;&#186;&#233;&#186;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#229;&#129;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#177;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#229;&#129;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#229;&#140;&#191;&#231;&#179;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#154;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#232;&#170;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#177;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#173;&#176;&#232;&#171;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;ACTION&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#190;&#191;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#177;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#229;&#164;&#177;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#170;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#173;&#176;&#232;&#171;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#174;&#159;&#233;&#154;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#155;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#172;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bloody Sands Dice Game is a game where you are a gladiator attempting to finish off your opponents. By fighting and gaining the will of the tribune you will be able to get the right combination of moves to win the game.&#10;&#10;You will control 5 dice with different cards that represent your preparation, the love of the people and the tricks you've learned through your days in the arena. You have to get a special order of symbols to get the ultimate move to defeat your enemies. But beware! All other gladiators are trying to get that same combination and they will do their best to make you fail!&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is completing a certain order of symbols set by a &quot;combo card&quot; each dice has 6 different symbols and they have to both match the symbols and their order shown in the &quot;combi card&quot; to win the game.&#10;You begin the game by rolling your 5 dice and leaving them in the order you rolled them, then you draw 4 cards from the deck. Each turn, you play one card from your hand and draw another, cards affect your dice or your enemies'. Move them around, change them, or re-roll them to get the winning combination! You must be fast and finish before someone else completes it or changes the required combination seconds before you win the game!&#10;&#10;Bloody sands Dice es un juego basado en el universo de Cruentis que es el mismo de bloody sands arena, a diferencia de arena aqu&iacute; encontraremos dados, estos est&aacute;n personalizados con un s&iacute;mbolo en cada una de sus caras. Cada jugador tiene a su mando 5 dados, 4 de ellos en el juego son denominados &ldquo;tus dados&rdquo; y el quinto que funciona como una especie de comod&iacute;n es denominado &ldquo;el favor del p&uacute;blico&rdquo;; tambi&eacute;n en el juego existe un mazo de 98 cartas que son las que har&aacute;n cambiar a los dados de sitio, cara y orden, el orden es muy importante ya que existen 10 combinaciones en el juego y siempre habr&aacute; una y solo una en juego que es la meta a conseguir para ganarlo, es decir, el que logre completar la secuencia que esta puesta en juego (que es una carta m&aacute;s) gana, aunque hay una dificultad y es que en cualquier momento alguien podr&iacute;a cambiar esta combinaci&oacute;n si lo permites. Otra cosa interesante de este juego es la cantidad de jugadores que pueden entrar, con una caja pueden divertirse hasta 6 personas y lo mejor de todo es que si el cupo no est&aacute; lleno en cualquier momento de la partida puede entrar un nuevo jugador sin afectar el desarrollo del juego. En fin es un juego de astucia y mucha diversi&oacute;n que te har&aacute; pasar un gran rato con tu familia y amigos.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;98 beautifully illustrated cards&#10;30 personalized dice&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "X&#196;&#147;ko (pronounced &quot;zeeko&quot;) is a collectible card game which has four editions (referred to as &quot;Missions&quot;). These are Mission: Madagascar, Mission: Costa Rica, Mission: Indonesia, and Mission: China. Each Mission highlights common and endangered plants and animals from in the region, and cards from all Missions can be mixed together.&#10;&#10;In X&#196;&#147;ko, each player's objective is to create the strongest, most balanced environment. The game begins with a Hotspot card on to which players can link their &ldquo;Species&rdquo; cards. Players link Species cards with other Species cards and battle other players in &ldquo;Turf Wars&rdquo; in order to collect &ldquo;Eco-points&rdquo; before one of the player&rsquo;s decks runs out of cards. In addition, &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; cards aid the players in Turf Wars, and &quot;X&#196;&#147;ko&quot; cards may help or hurt players in acquiring additional Eco-points by permitting changes to the standard game rules. When a player&rsquo;s deck is depleted, each player counts the Eco-points on his or her cards and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Each Mission: Madagascar Starter Set includes 2 endangered Cards, 10 Rare Cards, 2 Hotspot Cards, 36 Common Cards, 1 Extra Large Play Mat, 2 Learn-to-Play Guides, and 1 Rule Book. X&#196;&#147;ko cards are made from 100 percent recycled materials and 4 percent of game net sales are donated to Conservation International.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that it is not necessary to purchase a starter set  (around $20 to $30) to play the game. Booster packs (around $4) are just fine for building a deck, and contain a greater variety of cards - including Hotspot cards.&#10;&#10;",

It is played solo and up to 6 players, from 9 years. The parts last 30 or 90 minutes depending on the desired duration. The optional web application can be used free of charge.&#10;&#10;In Operation Arch&eacute;o, teamwork is at the heart of the game. Each of the six archaeologists has unique abilities. Who will you choose to incarnate? S&eacute;verine the team leader and her motivation techniques? Franck the backpacker and his paternalistic advice? Raphael the resourceful? M&eacute;lanie the hard to cook? Youssef the perfectionist?

You earn Fame by claiming territories and missions.&#10;&#10;Each round is divided into two phases, the Greek and the Ottoman.&#10;&#10;Greek phase has three steps:&#10;&#10;     Strengthening: For every Ottoman you defeated in the previous round you win an infantryman.&#10;     Attack: Choose an area next to yours and attack one with ottomans, take as many dice as the miniatures with a maximum of 5 dice. Defenders take the dice with a maximum of four.&#10;&#10;&#10;The battle takes place as in the classic RISK you compare the dice and the bigger one wins, in the draws the defender wins.&#10;&#10;     Move: You can move as many troops as you want from one area to another.&#10;&#10;&#10;Ottoman Phase: It follows the steps as of the Greek Phase except that firstly it has an &quot;Event&quot; phase (Event: Pull and read the first card from the event deck and follow the instructions) and their armies move first and then attack.&#10;&#10;Pleasant play, easy rules.&#10;&#10;Very beautiful and quality iconography and very beautiful miniatures.&#10;&#10;",

They can look at the cards briefly when they draw them, but then must face the cards away from them. On a player's turn, they can either take the top card from the deck into their hand or play one of their cards onto the table, attempting to make as many pairs as possible from the card just played and those already face up on the table.

    "Description": "&gt; MISSION&#10;&#10;Gridopolis Games was founded to break the mold of traditional flat &lsquo;bored&rsquo; games and challenge you to think creatively in 3D. This original way of thinking makes Gridopolis not just a fun strategy game, but also a compelling tool for STEM &amp; learning.&#10;&#10;&gt; INTRO&#10;&#10;Gridopolis is a three-dimensional strategy game. If you have ever played checkers or chess, you get the idea. Only now, we are playing in 3D. This means you can move and jump and play in any direction! You can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally &ndash; plus across multiple levels. Using an innovative (yet amazingly simple) structural system, game play happens in a three-dimensional space called a grid-set. And, unlike other games, the grid-set is dynamic and changes during play.&#10;&#10;The Gridopolis game &mdash; and system &mdash; is also flexible, modular and expandable. Grid-sets can be re-configured at any time to expand the game, change the rules, or even invent your own brand new game from scratch. The only limit is your imagination!&#10;&#10;&gt; GOAL / OBJECTIVE&#10;&#10;The goal of Gridopolis is to capture your opponents until you are the last one left or time runs out. You capture others by jumping over them. &#10;Any marker that gets jumped is captured and comes out of the game. Use a multi-jump to capture more than one opponent on a single turn!&#10;&#10;&gt; GAME PLAY&#10;&#10;MOVING&#10;Starting markers are called pawns. These can only move one pad at a time and never go backwards.&#10;A pawn becomes a king when it reaches the opponent's home-row, marked by a kingerizer. Flip your pawn and you are now a king. A king gets to move two pads at a time AND can move in any direction. Wow.&#10;&#10;JUMPING in 3D&#10;Any jump-capture move must follow the &lsquo;straight-line&rsquo; rule. Think of three points (or pads) in a row: your starting point, the opponent you are jumping over, and your landing point.&#10;&#10;OTHER MOVES&#10;&#10;     Hyper-pad : these pads are like teleporters. Land on one to get &lsquo;beamed&rsquo; to any other hyper-pad on the grid-set. The ride is all part of the same move.&#10;     Kamikaze : play outside the grid-set! If you have nowhere to land when jumping, you can still capture an opponent with this sacrifice move. Both markers must be on the same level and both are removed.&#10;&#10;&#10;BUILD (or SHRINK!) the GRID-SET&#10;At the beginning of a game, each player gets ten extra grid-set parts. At any time, you can change the grid-set in the following two ways. (NOTE : This counts as your turn.)&#10;&#10;     Add-a-pad : grow the grid-set at any time! Connect one of your extra pads to expand the grid-set horizontally or vertically.&#10;     Blocker-box : shrink the grid-set! Use this part to block a pad, taking it out of order for the rest of the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;SO MUCH MORE!&#10;This is just the first game in the Gridopolis Game System. You can also change the layout of the grid-set, tweak the rules, add new parts, and even create your own original game from scratch. Double wow.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Every time you press a button, you put a thumb token on that button card to show it's been used. You can press as many buttons as you like, but you can remove tokens from at most four cards at the end of your turn. Every other card with a thumb token still on it is then discarded, so pick your buttons wisely!&#10;&#10;Aside from mashing buttons, you can play cards from your hand by paying the button cost of the card. Fighter cards are powerful and unique to your fighter. You can play multiple fighter cards on your turn as long as you have the buttons to pay for them, and if the last button on a fighter card matches the first button on the next card you play, you need to put a thumb token on that button only once! Pick the best cards to string together for a super-powered hit!&#10;&#10;Super Punch Fighter includes a 1-2 co-operative mode called &quot;Minion Rush&quot; in which waves of minions try to overwhelm the board. Total your stars at the end to determine your rank, from lowly amateur to grand champion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;Before October 1944, no large German city had been directly assaulted by any Allied army. German soldiers were continuing to fight stubbornly throughout Europe, even after Germany's defeat became a certainty; so US commanders had every reason to worry resistance on German soil would be tenacious. In the city of Aachen itself, the street fighting was expected to be severe, just as it had been in other hard-fought cities. The situation along the border itself was even worse; the infamous West Wall loomed in front of Aachen, enclosing the city with miles of concrete bunkers, casemates and &quot;dragon's teeth.&quot; The sense of foreboding among the GIs assigned to the attack, as well as their commanding generals, was evident and warranted.&#10;&#10;Aachen utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From mortars to fighter-bombers, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by anti-tank guns &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy regiment of engineers defending a road junction. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself strafed by enemy fighter-bombers. More support will be necessary to take the road junction, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Aachen, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting in Aachen. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of 6 rounds, each player tries to win a round by scoring points for different card combinations.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he chooses any one card in his hand and places it face up on the playing area trying to match it by suit (curtain colour) with one on the table and take both into his point pile. If he cannot match a card from his hand, he must discard a card face up to the table. After matching or discarding a card, he then draws one card from the deck and places it face up on the playing area. If this card matches any card now on the table, he must match that card and take both for his point pile; otherwise, it becomes part of the table. In the event that the drawn card matches more than one card on the table, the player gets to choose which card to match and keep in addition to the drawn card.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, a player uses the spinner to determine how many layers up the tower their character peg can climb, and how many blocks they have to remove from the tower and stack on top of it. Blocks are marked with symbols that may cause players to gain or lose coins. Coins can also be gained from climbing the tower or defeating Bowser, who begins at the top of the tower and has to be beaten by climbing past him.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone collapses the tower, at which point the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Echt Spitze, you want to fill the spaces on your player sheet &mdash; both sides of it! &mdash; to score more points than anyone else.&#10;&#10;To play, each player takes a sheet from the score pad of the same level (1-3). The sheet has a 5x5 grid of squares on each side, with the rows and columns being numbered 1-5. Many of the spaces feature an icon (fruit, flower, gem, etc.) surrounded by a soap bubble.&#10;&#10;The active player rolls 4-6 dice, two more than the player count, then all players in turn choose one of the dice and place it on the matching number in either the row or column of their sheet. (Dice show 1-5 and a ?, which is a joker.) The active player then either keeps the remaining two dice or re-rolls them. Each player can then use one of the two common dice to target a particular space on their score sheet, e.g., if you placed a 4 on the 4 column and the two dice show 1 and 3, you then mark off either the 1-4 space or the 3-4 space on your sheet.&#10;&#10;If this space has a soap bubble, you mark off this space, poke a hole in it with your pencil, then flip the sheet over and mark off the newly poked space. Now you'll continue play on the back of your sheet, flipping it over again only when you &quot;pop&quot; another soap bubble.&#10;&#10;When you mark off an icon, no matter which side of the paper, track this in your score column. The first player to mark off all icons of a type receives the large bonus, then everyone else can score only the small bonus for this icon.&#10;&#10;One or both of your chosen dice might have an X on them. If this is the case and you don't pop a bubble this turn, you can mark off one or two extra spaces adjacent to the originally marked space for that turn. With two Xs, if you marked 1-4, for example, then you could mark 1-5 and 2-5. If you mark all squares in a row or column, circle the star next to that line.&#10;&#10;When someone scores their third type of icon, the game ends. Players tally their icon bonuses, points for each star (which vary per level), and 1 point for each collected icon that didn't receive a bonus. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Level 2 sheets have beehives, and when you mark off a beehive, the bees attack everyone else and they can no longer mark off this space, which means they can't complete this row and column. Level 3 sheets challenge you to create polyominoes with marked-out spaces, in addition to collecting icons.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1 Stein + Co. is an abstract game with simple rules. Players take turns placing stones. The goal is to enclose empty squares on the board. Each square enclosed by a played block counts one point (Enclosed space must not be able to fit a block). The stones measure 2 x 3 x 4 squares and can be placed in any of the three alignments (i.e. covering 2 x 3, 3 x 4 or 2 x 4 squares). After the first stone is placed, subsequent stones must touch at least one previously placed stone - but cannot touch a stone with the same alignment (unless the player is able to score with the new stone). When the board is so full that no further stone can be placed, the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;The rules offer a variant scoring system for three or four players, in which not only the active player scores, but also the player preceeding him/her.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "THIS GAME HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.&#10;&#10;Flintlock is a company level American Revolution game at a scale of about 50 yards per hex and about 50 men per counter/unit.  The system emphasizes the limits of command, training, and discipline, all in the milieu of the very linear style of warfare in the pre-Napoleonic era. In addition, it uses a most unusual set of mechanisms for resolving shock combat. Will you have your troops go into close order, or spread out for better fire possibilities? What are the pros and cons of the rifle-armed American militia? Can your dragoon forces exert any influence?&#10;&#10;Flintlock is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, but they cover almost every aspect of battle at this micro level. Playing time is less than 2 hours.&#10;&#10;The battles chosen highlight small unit tactics in the grueling Southern Campaign, where both sides had ample opportunities to watch, learn and practice, with an emphasis on formation. Some of the great commanders of the war, from Nathanial Greene and Daniel Morgan to Lord Cornwallis and the infamous, but capable, Banastre Tarleton are in full action.&#10;&#10;The Scenarios/battles, all (well, most) with armies of one or two thousand men, include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Camden (17 August 1780)  where Lord Cornwallis stood and confronted a much larger force under Horatio Gates, but the rebel militia disintegrated and Gates&rsquo;s army was routed in a major British victory. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Cowpens (17 January 1781). Daniel Morgan conducted a masterful, tactical battle, defeating Banastre Tarleton and destroying the dreaded British Legion in one of the major victories of the war.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Guilford Courthouse (15 March 1781). Nathanial Greene outnumbered Lord Cornwallis by more than two to one. However, the British took the field but with such heavy losses that, in retrospect, Greene could claim a strategic success.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hobkirk&rsquo;s Hill (25 April 1781) in which Nathanial Greene&rsquo;s Marylanders failed to stand against a concerted charge from Lord Rawdon&rsquo;s smaller but better disciplined army. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

While navigating the labyrinth of passages and diving deeper into the heart of the pyramid they ecounter various traps and other dangers, but also find usefull items.&#10;&#10;Althought the game is usually full of suprise and mystery (and has a certain amount of luck present), there is also a fair amount of strategic thinking required. You will be able to influence the labyrinth, plan ahead and work together with other archeologists.&#10;&#10;Farao can accomodate different playstyles - with beginners you can go for pure theme or with the thinking heads you can opt for more strategy. For example the strength of individual items depends on the random board setup (you gradually reaveal the game board during the game), so players may want to take this into consideration.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in two ways:&#10;&#10;     The small pyramid is suitable for beginners, as it only contains half of the obstacles and the labyrinth is smaller. This game lasts around 30 minutes.&#10;     The large pyramid is suitable for a longer game, giving the players more freedom in combining items and using various tactics. The basic rules for the game are always the same, so even beginners and younger children can easily pick this longer version up after a few plays of the smaller pyramid.&#10;&#10;&#10;Farao is largely language independent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Following the army build rules, each side can customize their force to suit their own strategy. They also control how the forces are deployed at the start of the game. The balancing factor is a victory point time limit and a growing defensive force. The attackers must move fast!&#10;&#10;The 20&quot; X 30&quot; map depicts the United States and surrounding areas as it was around World War 2. Areas are broken up into Land Territories, City Zones, Nuclear Research Sites, and Naval Landing Zones. The Allies must defend their 20 major Cities from Axis occupation in order to continue fielding their defensive forces. However, they must also keep the enemy from capturing the 2 research facilities across the U.S. so atomic research can be harnessed and Victory Points earned. Axis forces are tasked with simultaneously cutting off Allied supplies and capturing nuclear technology for themselves to crush the last remaining opposition to Axis world domination. By attacking America from both sides at once, coordination and decisive action is a must!&#10;&#10;AMERIKA also introduces veteran wargame players to a variety of new units like jet fighters and self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, while keeping each unit type&rsquo;s rules easy enough for beginners to master. With just 8 unit types in the game, purchasing and combat move fast and are resolved simply using a battle board. All 8 unit-types are unique to this game and cannot be found elsewhere.&#10;&#10;",

A game lasts 20 to 60 minutes depending on the number of players. Every player turn is divided into two main phases:&#10;&#10;1. Herophase&#10;2. Monsterphase&#10;The active player plays both phases and then the player to their left becomes the active player.&#10;1. The Herophase:&#10;The player recruits his Heroes and uses spells to conquer his battlefield, defeat the monsters controlled by the opposing player and seal the portals where they emerge.&#10;&#10;2. The Monsterphase:&#10;The opposing player recruits and controls monsters on the active player&rsquo;s battlefield. The opposing player tries to stop the active player by overrunning Andoria with these evil creatures.&#10;This abstract strategy allows the player to win the game in two different ways; either by defeating the forces of darkness and sealing the portals, or by overrunning his opponent&rsquo;s battlefield with monsters.&#10;&#10;Achieving victory by controlling the battlefields will require both strategic and tactical skill. Players will need to recruit powerful units, such as warriors or dragons, and use their unique abilities. They can be strengthened by casting helpful spells and building protective barriers.&#10;&#10;Will your heroes have the strength to unite the kingdoms and close the portals? Or will you aid the monsters in their quest to plunge Andoria into darkness and silence its music forever?&#10;&#10;",

If you accomplish your goals, you score points.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of five straight lanes, each a sequence of rectangular areas, and each rectangular subdivision has four dots of the racer's path (ie, ten consecutive rectangles will require dice-rolls totaling 40 to advance through).  Players also have a hand of four cards which conveniently overlay these rectangles and which have differing numbers of dots (from 0 to 8).  On a player's turn, he or she may play one of these overlaying cards on the board so as to make any player's path longer or shorter.  Then the player rolls the dice and moves his racer.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;advanced&quot; game, each player also has a hand of four action cards, some of which can be played on others and some of which can only be played on oneself.  These actions alter player's options (e.g. &quot;play no cards,&quot; &quot;move 10 spaces rather than rolling&quot;, etc).&#10;&#10;",

Possessing tiles of your maiko&rsquo;s color increases  your points. Conversely, possessing tiles of other colors decreases your points. Indeed Maiko is a game of memory but also elegance!During your training, you can also get kamon tokens, marks of prestige, that let you call upon four tutors  to  help  you  on  your  quest.  Each  tutor  possesses  a  unique  talent  that  will  lead  the  brightest  maiko to the victory. The maiko with the most points wins and begins her geisha career.&#10;&#10;",

The rent for the Casino is pure luck, but sometimes the owner has to pay out to the visitor.  Parks don't garner much rent, and what rent they gather is based on the weather, which can change with every Chance or Community Chest event (the Park's main benefit is its worth in Fortune Tokens at game end:  A Park on Gentle Sands is the equivalent of four million dollars cash at the end of the game).  Piers' rent depends not only on the weather, but also the presence or absence of a cruise ship, which is also affected by the card events.  Finally, Restaurants' rent is dependent upon the neighboring property improvements.  There are very few of these developments, though, so the competition for them can be fierce!&#10;&#10;Although the basic board layout is the same as a standard Monopoly board, there are no Chance and Community Chest cards; when a player lands on one of those two spots, the DVD determines what happens.&#10;&#10;One of the dice has a TV symbol in place of the 1-pip; when the TV is rolled, a News Broadcast is played on the DVD, which triggers a random event (much like Chance or Community Chest).&#10;&#10;Players collect Fortune Tokens (and earn them at the end of the game through their cash and property holdings).  Play ends when one player goes bankrupt (or, alternately, whenever the players decide to stop).  The player with the most Fortune Tokens at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",
