    "Description": "Yet another Monopoly variant, but this is not the same as &quot;Monopoly-Utah&quot; by Hasbro, nor &quot;Utah on Board&quot; by Help on Board. Description from the back of the box:&#10;&#10;&quot; Utah  is a land of incomparable natural beauty. It's varied terrain, from the snow capped mountains of northern Utah to the stunning red-rock country in the south, surrounds it's residents with breathtaking views on a daily basis. A place of great contrasts, the majestic Wasatch range rises dramatically behind the sparkling skyscrapers of progressive Salt Lake City. With a history forged by pioneers, Utah now embraces the future while delighting the eye and rejuvenating the soul. Yes...this is the place!&#10;&#10;&quot;UTAH IN-A-BOX was created with the help of Utah natives. We asked Utahns what makes this place so great. While it's impossible to include everything, UTAH-IN-A-BOX includes many of the highlights. Advertising space was not for sale on this game. The board includes authentic landmarks only.&#10;&#10;&quot;The game is full of mountains, parades, dinosaur footprints, salt, basketball, symphonies, ballet, a little more salt and lots of things Utahn! This is a game about a unique place, so roll the dice and take a hike! Who knows? You may win big in the Winter Games or become the proud owner of Skull Valley! Are you looking for a fun way to experience Utah? VOILA! -- behold; here it is!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Here's a quick idea of how to play: Buy property, build a skyline, trade the skyline for a key to the city. It sounds easy enough -- but add a traffic jam, property taxes, car fines and the IRS and it becomes a little more difficult and a lot more fun!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game with the strategy of chess and the simplicity of checkers.&#10;&#10;Players have 3 colors to choose from: blue, red &amp; yellow (BRY).  Each player controls 9 pieces of their color: 3 square pieces, 3 hex pieces and 3 round pieces. Printed on each piece is the shape of the kind of opponents&rsquo; piece it can capture: square, hex or round.&#10;&#10;Each player has one square piece that can capture opposing square pieces, one square piece that can capture opposing hex pieces and one square piece that can capture opposing round pieces. The same is true for hex pieces and round pieces.&#10;&#10;The playing board is triangular shaped with 3 types of sections: 3 Nests (where pieces start the game), 3 Pens (where captured pieces go) and the Ring (a center section where the action takes place).&#10;&#10;Pieces start the game in their nest and move directly to any empty space in the ring. They capture opponents&rsquo; pieces by moving straight-line to, and replacing, the captured piece in its space. The captured piece is sent to the Pen.&#10;&#10;When a piece moves into capture position on an opponent&rsquo;s piece, prior to capturing it, it can &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; the opposing piece by flipping it over. The flipped piece is frozen (cannot move) for one turn.&#10;&#10;There a 3 types of normal moves: Nest-to-Ring (described above), swapping a piece from the Pen with a piece in the Ring and moving a piece inside the Ring.&#10;&#10;There is one special moved called a &ldquo;release&rdquo;, which can occur in a 3-player game if a player is getting &ldquo;ganged up on&rdquo; or it can be considered a handicap move for beginning players. It is made by moving a previously captured piece from the Pen back to its nest to return to play.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the last player to have at least one un-captured piece remaining, after all opponents&rsquo; pieces have been captured and placed in their Pen.&#10;&#10;The symmetry of the game board combines with a simple game-play routine, creating several layers of strategy with respect to piece positioning and piece selection.&#10;&#10;",

This is a game conceived by Kreeda, and follows the footsteps of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita through the forest. Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. In the forest they have many adventures and face many hardships. Vanavaas - The Adventures in the Forest lets you understand their experiences and brings you face to face with the demons they meet in the forest.&#10;&#10;In the game, the footsteps are pictured as sandals or padukas - the old and traditional footwear worn by forest dwellers and rishis. The game is played with long dice which are the traditional dice in India.&#10;&#10;This game begins with Rama and Lakshmana leaving Ayodhya and follows their adventures in the forest. The game takes you through the stay at Chitrakoot, Bharata&rsquo;s encounter with Rama, the meeting with Shoorpanaka and the incident of the golden deer.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is to introduce the characters of the epic to children in a fun package which is easily absorbed and retained. It is suitable for children over five with some adult guidance. Now available with paduka shaped coins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player rolls two dice during their turn and flips over one, two or three (Shut the Box only allows one or two numbers to be flipped) chequers which add up to the total rolled on the dice. The player keeps going until he/she is unable to flip over chequers, when play passes to the next player. Each player is supposed to have their own set of chequers and before taking a turn, a player has to ante a chip into the centre of the table. When the turn comes round again, a player continues to try to flip over any remaining chequers that still show spots. The first player to go &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; (i.e. flip over all their chequers) gets all the chips from the centre as well as a chip for each spot still showing on other player's checquers. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Object of the game&#10;To earn the most points by creating line segments, boxes, and attempting to capture your opponent.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;1. Cut out the four square tiles and reassemble them to create a larger square.&#10;2. Player one begins by selecting a corner, circling the dot in that location with a colored pen or pencil, and placing his token on that dot. Player two then does the same thing in the opposite corner using a different color pen or pencil (Fig a).&#10;&#10;Fig a&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;1. At the start of each turn, a player has the option of (1) moving to an open adjacent dot (a dot is considered to be &ldquo;open&rdquo; if it has not already been circled by an opponent), or (2) turning one of the four squares one quarter turn, either clockwise or counterclockwise.&#10;2. If a player chooses to moves his token to an adjacent dot, the player then circles that dot, and draws a line segment of his/her color between the two dots. Tokens may only be moved vertically or horizontally, never diagonally.&#10;If a line segment created by a player&rsquo;s move creates a closed box, the player places his initial in that box to claim it. If a box is unclaimed at the start of the next player&rsquo;s turn, that player may initial it, thereby stealing it.&#10;Players may choose to hop between adjacent cards, but lines are never drawn between dots of adjacent cards. Players are simply hopping to the other card without creating a line&#10;&#10;Players may move to a dot that they have already claimed, but they may never move back along a line segment that has already been created. A line segment of any color represents a blocked path&#10;&#10;3. If a player chooses to rotate a card, the player does so and the player&rsquo;s turn ends. A card may never be rotated in one direction by one player and then back in the opposite direction by his opponent on the following turn.&#10;&#10;4. The game ends when both players agree that it is impossible for either player to create any additional legal line segments. If only one player is unable to move or create a legal line segment, his/her opponent is allowed to continue if he/she can move/rotate squares in such a way that additional line segments can be made. When no more line segments can be created, players tally their points to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;5. The game is also brought to an end if one player either moves or hops onto another player&rsquo;s token, thereby capturing his opponent. If a capture occurs, players still tally their points to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;Part of the 4 Tile Contest:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&#10;&#10;Freely available: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3169070#3169070&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Repent or Die! is a set of miniatures rules for wargaming Renaissance period battles (the game is subtitled &quot;Rules for the Wars of Power &amp; Religion 1492-1660).&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 25mm scale figures, though rules for basing 15mm and 6mm are given.  No figures are removed, so it is not critical how figures are based.  Suggested basing is 2 figures for infantry skirmishers and cavalry, and 4 figures (in two ranks) for non-skirmish infantry.  The typical units are 3 stands of cavalry (regiment) or a mixture of pike and shot stands for infantry (1 pike and 2 shot for a Swedish/Dutch regiment and up to 36 figures for a Tercio).  The scale is 1 figure = 50 men and 1&quot; = 50 yards.&#10;&#10;Significant features of the rules:&#10;&#10;- Each command group of units is given a standing order which it must follow.  Units continue to follow these orders until a new order is sent from the overall commander.  If the overall commander is too far away from the command, there will be delays in adopting the new order.&#10;&#10;- No figures are removed when damage occurs--units simply receive Disorder Markers (DM).  When ordinary units have accumulated 2 or more DM's (Tercios 4 or more DM), the unit becomes &quot;unformed&quot; and is unable to move at full speed and is less effective in fighting (e.g., unformed pikes are no longer at an advantage vs. cavalry).  Units automatically rally off disorder markers at a rate given by their morale and other attributes, and additional DM's can be rallied off if the unit remains stationary or has an attached commander.&#10;&#10;- Melees are resolved in multi-round battles until one side routs or is eliminated.  Losers of a round will accumulate Disorder Markers and be pushed back.  At some point, one side or other will rout and begin to retreat off the board.&#10;&#10;- Once a player loses a certain percentage of its units (depending on the army), units begin to retreat towards their board edge.&#10;&#10;No army lists are included, but scenarios are included which may give examples of typical units.  Scenarios included are: Seminara (French vs. Spanish, 1495), Barletta (French vs. Spanish, 1502), Otumba (Spanish vs. Aztecs, 1520), Pavia (French vs. Imperial, 1525), Breitenfeld (Sweden vs. Catholic League, 1631), and Rocroi (French vs. Spanish, 1643).&#10;&#10;",

On the&#10;map is that it has a grid of hexagons ('hexes'). There&#10;are railroads in some hexes. One hex (Konigsberg) also has a fort.&#10;On the map tile is also printed the Combat Results Table&#10;(CRT) used to resolve combat (see below) and a turn track.&#10;&#10;Army Tiles&#10;&#10;One player (the &quot;Russian Player&quot;) plays the attacker, controlling the two tiles representing the Russian 1st and 2nd armies. The other (&quot;German&quot;) player plays the defender, controlling the third tile, representing the German 8th army. Each army tile has two numbers printed on it. The one to the left is the combat power of that army. The one to the right is the movement allowance of the unit,&#10;which is 1 (one) for all armies. In the rest of these rules, the army tiles are refered to simply as &quot;units&quot;. A unit, as long as it is in the game, is always in (only) one hex on the map. Two units are adjacent to&#10;each other if they occupy hexes that are adjacent (that is if they share a common border). Two units may never occupy the same hex. The Russian units are enemy units to the German unit and vice versa.&#10;&#10;Victory&#10;If only one player has (an) unit(s) remaining on the map, then that player wins immediately. Otherwise, after 10 turns the Russian player wins if there is a Russian army in the fort (Konigsberg). If the Russian player did not win the German player wins (there can be no draw).&#10;&#10;Part of the 4 Tile Contest:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&#10;&#10;Freely available: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3170712#3170712&#10;&#10;Added under a Creative Commons Attribution licence.&#10;&#10;",

Each&#10;Fighter Card is not only used to keep track of which abilities a fighter has, it also tracks where in the&#10;Arena the fighter is and which moves the fighter is planning to perform in the upcoming turn. Each&#10;player has Ten health at the beginning of the game and two energy, each of which should be noted on&#10;the player's Fighter Card. The winner is the player that wins two out of three rounds.

It works like many other quiz games, as you can keep a card if you can answer a question on it (there are different categories, such as animals, technology, history etc.). However, there is a special movement mechanism that determines how far you can move on the game board: There is a pawn on an outer section of the game board which you can move forward by one or two squares. The number printed on the square you reach is the number of squares you can move, so you need to keep an eye on your own movement and of the possibilities you open for the next player(s). You can also challenge an opponent if you reach the same square as he or she, and if you are successful, you can take a card from him or her.&#10;&#10;",

Published in the Bulletin of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 1977.&#10;&#10;Includes two maps: one for the students to base their exploration program on, including leasing, shooting seismic, and drilling wells; and the other being the &quot;solution map&quot;, which shows the depth to a key horizon, structures such as anticlines and stratigraphic traps, and where the oil and gas fields are located. Also includes a &quot;stratigraphic column&quot; of rock formations from surface to the deepest depths.&#10;&#10;The base map includes lease blocks such as a National Forest, a Navajo Reservation, a State Park, other federal lands, and private (&quot;fee&quot;) land blocks such as farms or ranch property. The rules, included in the journal article, for drilling costs, leasing, drilling results. The rules list the oil price as $3 per barrel, with no mechanism for price fluctuation, indicating how long ago the game was designed, and how it would need to be updated for today's world. Nevertheless, this game was/is effective at teaching the principles of oil exploration in a fun setting that students really enjoy.&#10;&#10;",

Rommel&rsquo;s panzers were no more effective and it was only when Rommel ordered his 88mm AA guns to be used at antitank weapons was the British attack halted. However, the British two tank battalions and two infantry battalions, along with several French tank companies proved quite dangerous for several hours as nothing seemed to halt them. Rommel, himself, lost his cool and told his superiors he was under attack by division. The British armor continue to advance as shells bounced off their thick armor and it was in a desperation that Rommel ordered his four 88mm AA guns to level their barrels and fire in anti-tank mode. By the time this had occurred, the damage was done and the German High Command instructed its panzer spearhead to halt.&#10;&#10;Each turn is 30-45 min. Units are mostly company size. Each hex is 400-500 yards. Each game has 11x17&quot; map and has 280 counters.

First one out in a round gets 5 points; second, 4; et cetera, with last place getting 0.&#10;&#10;The bluffing variant allows players to keep their color a secret until the end of the round.&#10;&#10;In the gambling variant, the players have no colors.  Instead, each turn, the player also takes a bar in the color they think will do best.  For each color the player gets the color's score multiplied by the number of bars in that color she took.&#10;&#10;There are a handful of other minor variations, as well.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you simply place yourself or a follower, or eliminate an opponent's follower - or discard any number of cards.  In any event, you replenish your hand at the end of the turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends one round after either the deck is exhausted, the outer ring is full, or a player plays her last follower.  Each player scores 1 point for each follower (and deity) she has on the board, plus the scores for her clans.  Highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

There are limited written orders to enable the command structure, radio links, call of fire etc to be reproduced without slowing the game down.&#10;Limited ammunition is also a feature of the rules, which means players make their shots count, and don't waste time and effort firing at everything in sight like in an arcade game. Coupled with the command structure, artillery and air strikes are called where they are needed most, and not used every turn just because you have them.&#10;Vehicle damage can be cumulative as well as a straight KO, for example a Sherman tank cannot KO a Tiger tank through it's frontal armour at all. The Sherman must get around the side or rear. However there is a remote chance of a lucky hit causing track damage, or a turret jam. The chances are slim, and with limited ammunition are you going to take the chance?&#10;&#10;Aircraft, anti-aircraft and air to air combat are covered but extremely simplified to get a quick result as this is a ground battle.&#10;&#10;There is an easy to use variable ground scale, so a game can be quickly adapted for a small or large gaming area, or the use of different scale figures.&#10;&#10;These rules use a scale where 1 figure represents 1 man and 1 model represents 1 vehicle. Typical 15mm and 20mm scale battles require 50 to 120 figures, and 10 to 20 vehicles with no upper limit. Numbers can be in the 100's if 6mm scale is used.&#10;&#10;There is a points system for those who need one.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of a series of children's card games published by International Games in 1983.&#10;&#10;There is a deck of 34 cards, done in domino fashion with 7 animals: Bear, Camel, Fox, Mountain Goat, Leopard, Lion, Zebra. There is 1 of each pairing and 2 for each double -- except Fox, perhaps to make room for 2 rules cards out of the 36.&#10;&#10;Deal 4 each; the player with the alphabetically lowest double plays it.  In a turn a player plays a card that matches one end of the line, drawing a card if necessary.  He may play cards as long as he can; when he runs out of plays, he discards to end his turn.  The first player out of cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

Briefly, Malta is an island (17x9 miles) located in the Mediterranean Sea south of Italy. Its strategic position was taken advantage of by the British as a base for aircraft and naval units. These forces were in the perfect position to raid German freighters and air transports heading south to supply Rommel and the Afrika Korps in North Africa. Malta first came under attack by the Italians in 1940, and later by the Germans and Italians in 1941-42. Although severely battered, the island never fell.&#10;&#10;&#10;An expansion for Rise of the Luftwaffe found in RBM/GMT's C3i Magazine Nr3.

    "Description": "An abstract boardgame for two players. Each player has twelve pieces, shaped as externally identical little bells. One of the player has bells with clapper, the other has mute bells, and the only way to tell your pieces from your opponent's is to actually move and play them. The goal is to reach the opponent's end of the hourglass-shaped board with six of your own bells, but you're not allowed to move your opponent's pieces, or else you lose a turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gameplay is the same as the original Monopoly except:&#10;1.You have either one or two branches instead of houses and motels.&#10;2.Any three businesses in a row improves rent by 3x even if improved with a branch.&#10;&#10;Origin:&#10;David A. Colbert is a board game designer and puzzle and game manufacturer. An advertising executive, he came up with the idea of marketing a real estate trading game called Hometown Monopoly in which the properties on the board that are purchased and rented would be actual businesses in the hometown of the person purchasing the game. He produced his first game in 1980 for the city of Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He and a good friend, Arnold Miller of La Crescent, Minnesota held the copyrights and trademarks for the Hometown Monopoly series of boardgames through their holding company, Milco, Inc. Colbert incorporated Citigames of America, Inc. in 1982, and with that company and Hometown Productions, both Milco licensees,  went on to produce localized monopoly games for over 500 cities and towns in the United States and Canada. In 1985, Colbert developed Hometown Trivia and began to market that series of board games through Colbert Productions and Butler Games, Ltd. In 1986, Colbert marketed Puzzlement, a localized jigsaw puzzle that was sold only in Oshkosh and is a rare find today.&#10;   In 1988, Colbert sold the Trademark rights to the name Hometown Monopoly to Parker Brothers, Inc., producer of the famous MONOPOLY board game, licensing back from them the right to continue to produce his games in the cities and towns where he had developed versions of that game. In 1996, Colbert produced his last Hometown Monopoly game, fittingly an updated version of his original Oshkosh Monopoly.&#10;   Also in 1996, Colbert shifted his publishing focus from board games to magazines, building a second successful business with The Apartment Directory and The Builders Guide, both magazines serving the Fox Valley region of Wisconsin.&#10;   Colbert's Hometown Monopoly games for Baltimore and Washington DC led to his involvement with the nation-wide unification event, Hands Across America, which earned him an invitation to President Ronald Reagan's Second Inaugural Ball.&#10;    Today, David A. Colbert is retired and lives in West Palm Beach,&#10;&#10;",
