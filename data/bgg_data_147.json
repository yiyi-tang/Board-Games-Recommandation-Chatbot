Players each have a set of colored strips, with each strip containing a couple black bars across them, with the goal of solving puzzles by aligning the black bars on those strips.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, each player takes a board which limits the placement of strips.  The board also shows eight groupings of strips that may be used for the round (3 strips for a beginner game, and 4 strips for the advanced game).  A player then rolls an 8 sided die which dictates which grouping must be used for the round, and then players race to fit the strips onto their boards in a way that creates a continuous black bar across all of them by ordering and lining the strips up properly.&#10;&#10;The first player to finish gets to roll 4 dice, the results of which allow the player to advance down a scoring track.  The second player to finish gets to roll 3 dice, and all other players who complete the puzzle in the time limit get to roll 2 dice.  So, finishing early means a better chance to advance further on the score track, but does not guarantee victory due to the luck element.&#10;&#10;Once a player advances to the end of the score track, the game is complete and that player wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object is to win the game by ridding yourself of all cards in your hand before your opponent[s].&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;&#10;Decide on a scorekeeper. Once the cards have been shuffled, the scorekeeper deals 3 cards face down to each player, along with an equal number of white dice, called a stash. The scorekeeper places the remaining cards face down off to one side of the table to form a deck.&#10;&#10;The scorekeeper begins the game by rolling two dice (1 black &amp; 1 white) in the center of the table. If no one scores, play rotates clockwise to the next player who rolls two dice. Any two die, including the black die can be rolled (see below). Before each roll players examine their cards to see what dice combinations will be needed to match a card in their hand.&#10;&#10;Two white dice from your stash, or. &#10;One die from your stash, and one (previously rolled) die from the table, or&#10;Two (previously rolled) dice from the table.&#10;&#10;Player&rsquo;s take turns rolling until someone shouts STRUT! indicating a player believes they have won the round. A round is won when you match a card in your hand with a dice combination on the table. Let&rsquo;s say you have a 4 of a Kind (card) in your hand. There are 8 dice on the table 1,3,4,6 and four 5&rsquo;s: 5, 5, 5. You quickly shout Strut! believing your dice combination (four 5&rsquo;s) matches the card (4 of a Kind) in your hand, thus winning the round. But have you? You have if one of your 5&rsquo;s is the black die. The black die must always be part of the score.&#10;&#10;Keeping score is very simple. All dice on the table are scored. The black die counts face value [1]=1 point, [2]= 2 points [3]=3 points, etc. White dice count 1 point each. In the example above, you scored a total of 12 points (5 points for the black die and 7 points for the white dice.)&#10;&#10;After each round the winner&rsquo;s points are totaled by the scorekeeper. After the scorekeeper has recorded the points, the winner discards his/her winning card, placing it &ldquo;face up&rdquo; under the deck. If the winner&rsquo;s accumulated score totals less than 30 points then he/she must draw one new card from the deck. If the winner has accumulated 30 or more points, no card is drawn allowing that player to begin ridding his/her hand of cards in an attempt to win the game. (Re-Action cards are an exception to the &ldquo;30 points&rdquo; rule.) All other players keep their cards. Dice on the table are evenly redistributed. Note: As you will see as the game progresses, tactics and strategies become a big part of each round.&#10;&#10;The winner begins the next round by rolling 1 black and 1 white die. Play continues until someone shouts Strut! The first player to accumulate 30 or more points with no cards remaining in their hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Black Rooster&#10;&#10;If an opponent throws the Black Rooster card down on your winning card, it spells disaster! You must turn in all the cards in your hand, and draw 3 replacements. Plus, you lose all your accumulated points.&#10;&#10;",

Or play solo/cooperatively as a team to fight enemies, complete objectives, and survive!&#10;&#10;Every character is represented by a detailed 32mm-scale miniature, possessing their own rich history and personality, as well as powerful cybernetic abilities! Play the competitive or solo/cooperative modes through various narrative scenarios to survive the crisis! With innovative game mechanics like the Action Store and Luck Tokens, every game is thrilling and exciting. Enjoy a deeply tactical game in under an hour and introduce your gaming friends to skirmish games with Omicron Protocol!&#10;&#10;&#10;In the game, you play with a squad of 1-4 characters, either competitively against another player/team, solo, or cooperatively with friends. Each round consists of spending a shared pool of action points on your characters, activating them one-by-one, and using movement and tactics to survive the onslaught of the Cyber-Memetic Sociopaths (CyMS). All games are based on scenarios derived from the lore of the world (120K+ word collection of stories), and the game can be linked together into a light campaign in both competitive and cooperative modes.&#10;&#10;In competitive scenarios, the team that scores the most victory points wins. In solo/cooperative scenarios, the players win if they reach the VP goal within a specified number of rounds.&#10;&#10;&#10;Background:&#10;&#10;Everything can change in a month. The cutting edge West Coast city of San Lazaro had been the epicenter of a cybernetics tech revolution in 2044, ushering all of humanity into the future...but in the year 2050, a mysterious viral menace the likes of which the world had never seen toppled the utopian city in a sea of infection and death. The disease could not be stopped; it evolved to surpass any countermeasure, mutated to answer any cure. In mere days San Lazaro was overwhelmed by the infected.&#10;&#10;Martial law descended on the city immediately. Barricades and armed soldiers divided its streets into isolated sectors. Efforts to contain the outbreak were as useless as the attempts to control the surging numbers of mysteriously insane and violent residents, a second catastrophe on the heels of the first.. Dubbed &lsquo;Cyber-Memetic Sociopaths&rsquo; by the media, with their actions being blamed on an over-immersion in virtual reality, these &lsquo;CyMS&rsquo; were spreading across the city in a wave of mindless, indiscriminate violence. With the infection spreading and the murderous CyMS rampaging, the government abandoned San Lazaro and its people after a mere two weeks.&#10;&#10;All that remains of the city now is a twisted hellscape. The few survivors have banded together in hopes of escaping, while gangs once suppressed by the government have seized control. The CyMS have grown into a constant threat on the streets, sowing fear and terror in their path. In this waking nightmare, your only chance of salvation is to join a faction powerful enough to dominate the foes that stand in your way.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

When this happens, a mystical flower appears. However, it will not appear to just anyone &mdash; only to the most knowledgeable mage on the island at that time. Will you be that mage?&#10;&#10;Spellbloom is a tableau-building, open-drafting game during which players roll dice that are used to determine both which spells they can learn and the resources to pay for those spells.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has six colored dice that at the start of play they roll and place on their spell book. Six random spell cards are placed on the six colored locations on the island board. On a turn, you choose a die that matches the location from which you want to learn a spell, then pay for that spell with other dice that sum to the value of the first die. If you use two dice to claim a spell, you gain two mana, which you can use on future turns to adjust a die's value or claim an unowned die on the island board; if you use three dice, you gain 3 knowledge points.&#10;&#10;Each spell has a unique ability that helps players learn new spells or score additional knowledge points. You gain other bonuses by placing spells in matching locations in your spell book or by placing spells adjacent to one another to complete sigils. You start the game with two task cards that can grant endgame points if you meet their conditions, and you gain two more tasks when you complete a row of your spell book. When someone completes their tenth spell, you finish the round, then tally points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The First World War is coming to an end. It had a devastating impact on Habsburg Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire, which over 120 years earlier partitioned and wiped the Polish&ndash;Lithuanian Commonwealth from the maps. But this global conflict that exhausted the partitioners of Poland gives the opportunity to restore Poland and regain independence. Now, go back to the time of the First World War and join the key statesmen of the era. Responsibility for the existence and the future shape of Poland lies on your shoulders. Only through cooperation may you revive your homeland and protect it from its enemies. Are you brave enough to undertake the mission?&#10;&#10;Niepodleg&#197;&#130;a, which is Polish for &quot;independent&quot;, is a board game published by Poland's Institute of National Remembrance to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the rebirth of Poland. The game illustrates the events that led to the restoration of Poland's sovereignty. This co-operative game played with dice and cards is for 2&ndash;4 players aged 12 or over and has two variants: basic, mostly aimed at education (30 minutes) and advanced for intermediate or experienced players (90 minutes).&#10;&#10;The scope of the gameplay are the events of the years 1910&ndash;1920 with an emphasis on the period between the outbreak of the First World War and the restoration of Poland's sovereignty in 1918. The board represents the former and &mdash; eventually &mdash; future territory of Poland. The players immerse themselves in the operations undertaken by the key characters of the battle for the independence; they try to spread the ideas of independence, seek a national consensus, and strengthen Poland's position in the world. If they fulfill certain conditions, Poland will regain sovereignty in the grand finale in 1918.&#10;&#10;However, despite regaining independence, if the players fail to meet decisive challenges &mdash; the Peace Conference in Paris, the development of a new state administration, the struggle over Poland's borders as well as the uprisings in Greater Poland and Silesia and the Poland-Bolshevik war &mdash; Poland may well cease to exist.&#10;&#10;Niepodleg&#197;&#130;a has 50 wooden pieces (including 19 special dice), 110 beautifully illustrated large playing cards and 24 smaller ones, as well as 88 cardboard pieces, 2 instruction leaflets (for both variants) and a richly illustrated booklet with a historical essay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Game play is the same as the classic board game except for a few interesting twists:&#10;&#10;&middot; When you attack an opponent&rsquo;s piece, the computer tells you whether you have won, lost, or tied.  So you do not know the exact strength of the opposing piece, only its strength relative to your own piece (and so too your opponent does not know the exact strength of the piece you used to attack with).  This feature makes the game quite a bit more interesting than standard Stratego.&#10;&#10;&middot; Instead of moving one of your pieces on your turn, you can &ldquo;probe&rdquo; an opposing piece to find its strength.  You will not be given its exact strength, but instead what &ldquo;class&rdquo; it is in (8-9, 5-7, or all else)&#10;&#10;&middot; Bombs are no longer playing pieces but are hidden features on your side of the board that are programmed into the game.  You secretly select six spaces in which to place the bombs.  Your own pieces can move through these spaces unharmed, but any enemy pieces (except a Miner) landing on these spaces will be destroyed!&#10;&#10;&middot; Scouts can move and strike diagonally, and can strike from a distance.&#10;&#10;The player who finds and captures his opponent's flag first wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mini Christmas is a set collection card game where you cleverly collect different types of Christmas items and trade them for victory points (VP) at the right time. The more items of the same type you have, the more VP you score, but you might risk losing them if someone trades cards of the same type before you do!&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;The cards are shuffled and laid down in a pyramid containing 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 cards in each row.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one of the two actions:&#10;&#10;1. Take one row of cards into your hand, and refill the cards in the row.&#10;&#10;(1) You can take the card(s) in the first row for free.&#10;(2) If you want to take cards from the lower row, you must put one card from your hand into each row you skipped.&#10;Example: You want the cards from the third row, you have to put one card each in the first and second rows. (Put down a total of two cards from your hand).&#10;(3) After taking the cards (and putting down cards if necessary), refill the row back to its initial number of cards (1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 cards).&#10;&#10;2. Play cards from your hand to score victory points (VP)&#10;&#10;(1) Play cards to score:&#10;- If you play 3/5/6 cards of the same type, you score 1, 2, or 3 VP, respectively.&#10;- You keep a number of played cards facedown in front of you as your VP and discard the others to the discard pile.&#10;- You may play as many sets of different types of cards as you want and score VP individually.&#10;Note: Santa cards are wild and can be used as any type of item card.&#10;&#10;Example: Wendy played 3 Snowman cards for 1 VP and 5 Chrismas Tree cards for 2 VP, respectively. She kept 3 cards as her VP and discarded the other 5 cards.&#10;&#10;(2) Force others to discard cards:&#10;- If any players have 2 or more cards the same type as what you have played, they have to discard half of the cards from their hand (rounded down).&#10;- For each card the other players have been forced to discard, you can draw one card from the draw pile as a reward.&#10;&#10;Example (continued): Bob had 3 Snowman cards in hand and he discarded 1 of them. Poki had 4 Christmas Tree cards in hand and discarded 2 of them. Then, Wendy drew 3 cards from the draw pile as her reward.&#10;&#10;When someone reaches a certain amount of VP, the game ends after all the other players take a final turn. Whoever has the most VP wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MixUp - The Game Where Color Takes on Shape!&#10;&#10;In this two-player abstract, players try to place tiles in an arrangement of 4-in-a-row or a 2x2 square &mdash; one player goes for shapes, the other is using colors. There are three shapes in three colors, 54 tiles total, one shape per tile. The board is a tilted easel; you slide your tile down one of the 7 grooves till it reaches the lowest available spot. After that it can't be moved. The four-in-a-row may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. The trick is to concentrate on your objective (color or shape) while keeping an eye on what your move does for your opponent. The first player to complete a row or square of a common color or shape is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Harvest of Death: The Second Day at Gettysburg is an excellent Tactical level &quot;mini-wargame&rdquo; released in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #129. Depicts the often designed fighting in, on and around &quot;Little Round Top&quot; during the Rebel assault in the late afternoon of the 2nd day of Gettysburg. Players receive points for destroying enemy brigades as well as several geographical features of the battlefield such as Little Round Top, Devil's Den, the Peach Orchard, the infamous Wheat Field and the Angle. Silhouette style counters depicting Union and Rebel troops in the traditional Blue and Gray colors add to the feel of the ebb and flow of the fighting. The map is quite small but is more than useful and never seems to get crowded.&#10;&#10;One huge bonus... the game can be played solitaire, as rules have been added so a solo player can take control of the advancing Confederates, whilst the game mechanics take care of the defending Union brigades.&#10;&#10;One wishes that more &quot;smaller&rdquo; scale and sized wargames had been produced over the years, I recommend this game to all ACW wargamers and anyone who likes solo wargaming.&#10;&#10;Nominee for the 1989 Charles S.

Unable to launch the invasion of France in 1943, and needing to keep the pressure up in order to prevent German troops being sent to the East Front, the Allies opt to invade Sicily as a stepping stone to Italy. Operation Husky is the code name of the Allied Invasion of Sicily.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame.

No CRTs.&#10;&#10;The game also uses opportunity cards for each player, whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player to enhance the game. Resource points are used acquire opportunity cards or refit units. Players are limited in their resource points. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&#10;&#10;Playing time for MedWar Sicily 2 to 3 hours. The rules have a section on Solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Game comes with a 34&quot; x 22&quot; mapsheet, full color counters, rules, dice, player aid charts, and box.&#10;&#10;This is an excellent 1 to 4 player game.

    "Description": "Spirits are high at the studio, coming off the success of your first major release. But as you run out of awards to win and crew members to toast, there's one question on everyone's mind: can you pull it off a second time?&#10;&#10;The director says she wants the next film to be bolder, riskier, and more challenging to the audience. You're skeptical, but she assures you there's no reason to worry: if it doesn't test well, we can fix it with a secret weapon she likes to call &quot;reshoots.&quot;&#10;&#10;The cameras are rolling on our newest blockbuster: Moving Pictures: Dinosaur Outbreak! This cooperative game for 2 players was designed by Chris Klimowski and is sure to be a big hit.&#10;&#10;In Moving Pictures: Dinosaur Outbreak! players take turns placing numbered scene cards from their hand into the shared Timeline row in hopes of getting all 6 cards in order. The catch? They can't speak or signal to each other, so they'll have to watch each other's play closely for clues. Each card also has an effect listed which can impact placement, swap cards around, or even allow players a rare opportunity to share information.&#10;&#10;Getting it right once is a feat in itself but a full game of Moving Pictures: Dinosaur Outbreak! is played over 3 Acts. The Timeline grows with each Act, making each round harder than the one before. Thankfully you also have access to 2 Deleted Scenes: if the round would end with scenes out of order, you can spend a Deleted Scene to hide one card. These Deleted Scenes don&rsquo;t refresh, meaning that you only get 2 mistakes before the credits roll.&#10;&#10;COMBINING GAMES&#10;Dinosaur Outbreak! can be  combined with another Moving Pictures game. If combining, choose one scene card each numbered 1-16 to play with, and any two Deleted Scene cards.&#10;&#10;",

Covering the period 450AD to 600AD the rule book combine all you need to fight tabletop games and to run a virtually paper-free campaign.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed to be played with relatively small forces. A Saxon starter Army is just 38 figures, a British starter army is only 44 figures, both of which can be purchased from our web site in 28mm although the rules play just as well with larger or smaller figures. Forces are grouped into six figures for most warriors and four figures for skirmish and missile troops or cavalry. The tabletop rules are D6 based and simple to use, with the single page playsheet on the rear cover of the rules covering 99% of situations. Activation is determined by a speedy card driven system where all units get to act in any single turn.&#10;&#10;Included with the rules is an A3 pull out map of Britian in around 450AD which provides the background setting to the Dux Britanniarum campaign. Your characters start their campaign as a Saxon Lord or a Romano-British Tribune and will attempt to gain fortune and reputation on the battlefield as you fight to defend or conquer a Romano-British kingdom. Included with the rules are four detailed maps which together cover moderd Britain, Wales and lowland Scotland along with an historical background to each kingdom.&#10;&#10;A character generation system will add colour to your campaign as your Nobles assume their own personalities. The terrain and scenario generator allows games to be set up quickly and to result in an almost infinite variety of games to keep you challenged and enjoying the action. The tabletop rules provide for a fast play system with a fun and exciting narrative as your Nobles lead their men into battle. The unique three phase battle system and force morale mechanism allows you to fight your battles with a minimum of preparation and tie those results into the campaign system for a really exciting and fun gaming experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "World War 2 veteran Kurt Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano, was published in 1954. While it was critically well received and reprinted in 1955, it was not a financial success. As he worked on his next novel (which would eventually become Cat's Cradle), he needed to supplement his income with other endeavors.&#10;&#10;One of those efforts was an original board game called GHQ (General Headquarters). He designed it throughout 1956 and attempted to sell it to game companies, an effort that was ultimately unsuccessful. His notes on the game were filed away and Vonnegut's GHQ was lost to us.&#10;&#10;Until now.&#10;&#10;GHQ is a fast and strategic two-player battle game. Played on a standard 8x8 checkerboard, players command infantry, armored vehicles, artillery, and the powerful airborne regiment, maneuvering to capture the opposing headquarters. Can you skillfully use real-world combined arms tactics and call on reinforcements at the right time to turn the tide of battle?&#10;&#10;This first edition of GHQ features deluxe wooden pieces and a 24-page commentary booklet showing Kurt Vonnegut's design notes to give insight into his creative process.&#10;&#10;",

Each unit represents either one vehicle or one &quot;fireteam&quot; (four infantrymen).&#10;&#10;The game scale is 50 meters per hex and 40 seconds per Game-Turn. Each Game-Turn is comprised of a Fire Phase, followed by a Movement Phase, during which the players alternate moving units (those that have not fired), and terminating with an Indirect Fire Phase, during which the players employ and assess fire from off-map artillery and mortar units.&#10;&#10;Firefight makes extensive use of tables to express the strength of a firing unit against a particular target at a given distance. This strength (or firepower rating) is then referred to a Combat Results Table. This procedure allows us to rate different weapon systems versus different target types with much greater accuracy than heretofore. Another innovation is the integration of the terrain effects directly onto the CRT's. Results are colour-coded to graphically display the protection offered by woods, building and defilade (hull-down) positions. The whole effect is a much simpler, but more accurate system of combat.&#10;&#10;Firefight is presented in three stages. Firefight I, II and III. Firefight I introduces the player to the fundamental game system. Firefight II introduces more complex rules, which add realistic effects yo play. Firefight III explores the effects of weapons systems presently under development.&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the SPI soap box cover:)&#10;&#10;Modern US and Soviet Small Unit Tactics&#10;&#10;A Fascinating Future-History Simulation Game&#10;the time is: The First Battle of the Next War&#10;&#10;What if the US and USSR were to meet in a conventional war? Firefight highlights the dynamics of today's battlefield and includes an intensive survey of battlefield tactics and doctrine. The range and lethality of weapons in each country's service are contrasted as players use the tactical deployment of their combined arms system to test the capabilities of their small tactical units. Firefight simulates this possible conflict on a map based on US Army specifications of probable terrain conditions. Colorful cardboard playing pieces move, position, and engage for battle through a superimposed hexagonal grid, which functions like a chessboard's squares. Simple probability charts determine each combat's outcome.&#10;&#10;Contains: comprehensive historical situation briefing; 20 page rules booklet; 400 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; two different 22&quot; x 34&quot; soft map sections; and various playing aids.&#10;&#10;Level of Complexity: Moderate&#10;Average Playing Time: 2 hours&#10;Suitability for Solitaire Play: Moderate&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Old Contemptibles: The Battle of Mons, 1914 is an operational-level simulation of the first major clash between the Germans and British in 1914.  The German Player is on the offensive, attempting to win the game by eliminating or isolating British units and seizing key terrain on the map.  The British Player is on the defensive, first attempting to prevent the German player from achieving that side's objectives, then escaping off the map with the bulk of the BEF still intact.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately one mile from side to opposite side.  Each game turn equals about two hours.  The units of maneuver in the game are mostly regiments for the Germans and battalions for the British.  Each full-strength German infantry regiment contained some 4,000 men and three-dozen cannon; each full-strength British battalion had some 2,000 men and 18 cannon.&#10;&#10;Since this battle was fought over only two days, and both sides' forces entered pretty much fully supplied, there are no supply rules.  Similarly, there are no replacements.  And finally, there are no concentric assault rules, since the British were too proud to become scared when they were surrounded, and the Germans wer too inexperienced to know they should be scared when they were surrounded.&#10;&#10;(from section 1.0 of Rules)&#10;&#10;",

Watch out, though, as other players can sabotage your habitat with the menacing bull shark &mdash; oh, the hu-manatee...&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with one manatee on a starting tile that can hold up to four manatees.

When you place two half-symbols next to one another, you can get bonuses or score points. Next, take the action of the column from which you took a tile:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Add a manatee to your starting tile (if you have room); for each completed breeding symbol in your habitat, add an additional manatee.&#10;     Move a manatee in your habitat from one tile to another. Manatees can't pass through one another (or through the bull shark), and each tile other than the starting tile can have only one manatee on it. For each completed swim symbol, you can move an additional manatee.&#10;     Take a photo card from the four on display: an orange card gives you points at game's end depending on how well you match the condition on it (e.g., a completed fish symbol), and a green card gives you points immediately...but you must match the condition on it to claim the card.&#10;     Engage in shark sabotage, first moving the bull shark to an empty tile in another player's habitat, then taking the action on the shark die, either stealing a manatee from another player or placing an extra tile in your habitat.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player takes their fifth photo card or the last manatee is removed from the supply, each player takes one more turn, then the game ends.

    "Description": "In a world where steam and gears reign supreme, the tranquility of the cities is threatened by the arrival of a Mechanical Giant. Its origin and motivations are a mystery, but driven by an inexhaustible energy, this colossus of metal sows chaos in its wake, leaving behind ruins and hearts filled with fear. Faced with this unprecedented challenge, three brave heroes of diverse skills and origins unite with a common goal: to stop the unstoppable machine of destruction. Together, they must face unimaginable dangers, test their wits, and risk everything to protect humanity and restore hope. The fate of all now depends on the courage and determination of these three heroes.&#10;&#10;Game Development:&#10;The game consists of resolving: 1) the Giant cards, 2) the Heroes' rondels, and 3) the City cards. These mechanics are explained in detail later, but it is most important to understand this sequence.&#10;If the Giant cards run out, it is considered that the Giant has reached the City. From then on, the sequence is: 1) The City receives 2 points of damage, 2) The rondels are resolved, and 3) The City mechanics are resolved. This continues until the Giant is defeated or destroys the City.&#10;&#10;&#10;Introducci&oacute;n:&#10;En un mundo donde el vapor y los engranajes dominan, la tranquilidad de las urbes se ve amenazada por la llegada de un Gigante Mec&aacute;nico. Su origen y sus motivaciones son un misterio pero, movido por una energ&iacute;a inextinguible, este coloso de metal siembra el caos a su paso, dejando a su estela ruinas y corazones llenos de temor. Ante este desaf&iacute;o sin precedentes, tres valientes h&eacute;roes de diversas habilidades y or&iacute;genes se unen con un objetivo com&uacute;n: detener la imparable m&aacute;quina de destrucci&oacute;n. Unidos, deben enfrentar peligros inimaginables, poner a prueba su ingenio y arriesgarlo todo para proteger a la humanidad y restaurar la esperanza. El destino de todos depende ahora de la valent&iacute;a y determinaci&oacute;n de estos tres h&eacute;roes.&#10;&#10;Desarrollo del Juego:&#10;El juego consiste en ir resolviendo: 1) las cartas de Gigante, 2) los rondeles de H&eacute;roes y 3) las cartas de Ciudad. M&aacute;s adelante se explica en detalle estas mec&aacute;nicas pero lo m&aacute;s importante es entender esta secuencia.&#10;Si se acaban las cartas de Gigante, se considera que este lleg&oacute; a la Ciudad. A partir de entonces la secuencia es: 1) La Ciudad recibe 2 puntos de da&ntilde;o, 2) Se resuelven los rondeles y 3) Se resuelven las mec&aacute;nicas de la Ciudad. Esto contin&uacute;a hasta que el Gigante sea derrotado o destruya la Ciudad.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mia is an ancient bluffing dice game using two dice and a cup to conceal the dice. There are affinities with Perudo (and the card game Cheat), but also some interesting differences. Mia is often purported to have been played by the Vikings.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling the dice beneath a cup and announcing a higher roll than the previous roll.  This announcement can be challenged, with the roller losing a life if caught lying, and the challenger losing a life if the roller was truthful (players typically start with three lives).  There is also the option (instead of rolling the dice oneself or challenging the previous roller) of  passing your turn (without viewing the roll under the cup) to the next player.  In this case the passer assumes responsibility for the roll as if he or she had rolled it him- or herself.  (Thus, if the next player challenges the announced value, it is the passer who stands to lose a life if the value under the cup is not that which was announced.)&#10;&#10;One interesting feature of Mia is the non-standard ordering of rolls. &quot;21&quot; is &quot;Mia&quot;, the highest roll.  Next come the doubles in ascending order: 11 is the second best roll, then 22, 33, 44, 55, 66.  From there the numbers descend, with the higher die always naming the tens value and the lower die naming the ones value:  65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 54, 53, 52, 51, 43, 42, 41, 32, and 31 as the lowest value.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There were three emperors at Austerlitz.  Two of those emperors were the product of hidebound tradition and court intrigue; the other was the product of an insatiable ambition for glory coupled with a limitless appetite for hard work.  Two saw their armies in terms of being a regal adornment of colour, martial airs, and ceremonial drill; the other knew his army down to the last pot of axle grease and the face of every soldier aspiring to win a marshal&rsquo;s baton.  Two dallied with war; for the other, war was his stock-in-trade.&#10;&#10;On December 2nd 1805, in a very ordinary part of Moravia, the mettle of all of them was put to the test.&#10;&#10;Trafalgar Editions&rsquo; Austerlitz is a miniatures-orientated rendering of Napoleon Bonaparte&rsquo;s greatest triumph.  Using an adaptation of the system first seen in Waterloo 1815: Napoleon&rsquo;s Last Battle, Austerlitz offers a larger battlefield for manoeuvre, the early morning effects of fog (hidden movement and the chance that forces will blunder into each other), and opposing armies of contrasting strengths and abilities.&#10;&#10;The battle is played out on a beautiful and entirely grid-less rendering of the historical terrain, upon which players will deploy and move their forces.  Those forces are represented by tokens of various size, depicting infantry in all the key Napoleonic formations, as well as cavalry in both column and line, and foot and horse artillery.  Combining modern design sophistication with the practice and look of traditional kriegspiel, this is Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory rendered the way the emperor himself would appreciate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The other new kind of piece are the Champions, which are located in the corners of the 10x10 square, with a Pawn in front of them (there are ten in total) and a Tower to their side. The remaining pieces - that are also found on a traditional 8x8 square - are between the Champions and their Pawn, arranged as usual.&#10;&#10;Similarly to the Knight, the new pieces are classified as leapers, which allows them to jump over pieces. A Champion can jump two squares in all eight directions. The Wizard can either jump three squares straight and then one square to either side, or move one square diagonally. Except for Pawns, standard pieces move as usual. Pawns are also allowed to move three squares from their initial position. As with moving two squares at once, they can be captured en passant when doing so.&#10;&#10;",

The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.&#10;&#10;Ingenious Extreme features the same gameplay as Ingenious, but with the domino-style tiles consisting of two conjoined octagons instead of two conjoined hexes. Since the pieces in Ingenious had six colors on them, 'Ingenious Extreme features eight colors, giving players more to juggle as they try to score well across the board while shutting out opponents.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two empty octagon spaces of the game board. For each octagon on this tile, they score one point in that color for each octagon of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each octagon in a straight line from it. (In all you must check for scoring in seven directions from each half of the tile; you never look back from one half of the tile through the other half.) If a player brings the score of a color to 13, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 13 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&#10;&#10;",

As the crowd watches the very entertaining spectacle of people trying to feel a shape without looking in, pulling the bag back and forth, and trying not to pull out the wrong shape, or a black shape, or to grab the camel piece and slam it down shouting &quot;I'm the camel!&quot;, they get to decide if players have cheated or failed the task. It's a very aggressive but fun game. First player to seven pieces win.&#10;&#10;The rules are suprisingly complex though, with several What If variants that you have to run through to understand all the possible outcomes. The other three games in the rules offer variants on what to do with the pieces, such as build a tower, but it's essentially still a duel. Along with Bausack and Bamboleo, Zoch seem to have cornered the market in oddly shaped wooden pieces. Dscahamal is nicely made and fun, but you may tire of it quickly, both physically and mentally.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker developed Laska (a.k.a. Lasca), a variant of the Checkers Family, in 1911. The game board and play resembles that of Checkers, but captured pieces remain on the board and can possibly be freed later in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game on the 7x7 board with eleven soldiers. On a turn, a player moves one soldier diagonally forward one space. If a capture is available, then the player must make that capture, trapping the captured piece underneath the capturing one; if the newly captured piece had previously had one or more pieces underneath it, then those pieces are now free to move in future turns. If a soldier reaches the opponent's back row, it's flipped and promoted to an officer, which can move diagonally in all directions. The game continues until either a player can't move or a player has no pieces remaining on the board. In both cases, this player loses the game.&#10;&#10;Laska was influenced by Bashni.&#10;&#10;",

The aim of the witch hunter is to capture 5 witches, while the towns want to form a coven of three witches of the same suit in one player's hand to win.&#10;&#10;The game plays through four main phases.&#10;&#10;Census, where all the towns&rsquo; cards are revealed. These will be a mix of witches, innocent villagers, rituals or a fake witch (scarecrow). Players win if they have 3 cards of 1 witch suit in 1 player&rsquo;s hand, or may cast a spell on the witch hunter if they have 2 witches in hand. Then they discuss their plans for the round, but with the witch hunter listening!&#10;&#10;Arrival, where the witch hunter observes then deals 1 new card to each town player. The witch hunter now knows what everyone has in hand, but the players get new information which they cannot communicate to their team.&#10;&#10;Travel, where town players consider the new card they&rsquo;ve received, then each give or request a hidden card to or from other town players. They may also protect or later access a key card by swapping it into the woods, safe from the witch hunter. The witch hunter observes the cards moving, but not exactly what goes where.&#10;&#10;Hunt, where the witch hunter picks 2 cards in total from the towns, trying to capture witches while avoiding innocent villagers, dangerous ritual cards, or the fake witch which frees previously captured witches.&#10;&#10;These repeat until one side has won.&#10;&#10;The town players need to communicate carefully to consider their options, how to manage risks and protect key cards, and understand when to make decisive moves, all while the witch hunter listens. Both roles require players to weigh up probabilities and consider previously discussed plans against new imperatives that might signal necessary changes in strategy as the round progresses.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

To win, players must knock out their opponent by reducing their opponent&rsquo;s health meter to zero. Each time a player is shot, they lose a health point; when a player has zero health points remaining, they are knocked out and the game ends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Doublehead Kids is a card game for four (or more persons), which depicts the &ldquo;Doppelkopf&rdquo; normal game with cards suitable for children. The game is suitable for players from about 6 years (the numbers from 1 to 20 must be read and recognized independently) and lasts about 30-45 minutes or 60-90 minutes, depending on the chosen winning score.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Doppelkopf&rdquo;-Game is one of the most popular German card games, which finds more and more enthusiastic fans and supporters, who organize themselves in clubs and even in a German umbrella organization (DDV). Doppelkopf even manages to replace the extremely popular game Skat as the favourite card game of the Germans. Doppelkopf probably originated from the game &ldquo;Schafkopf&rdquo;, which already had a set of rules since 1895. Doppelkopf got its name from the fact that all cards in the game are doubled. DOUBLEHEAD KIDS for 4 players consists of 48 playing cards. The playing cards have differently displayed strengths (shield symbol at the top left), which determine the ranking of the card and silver winning coins, which represent the winning value of a card. Furthermore the cards are assigned to four different family coats of arms (colours): the royal family with the red crown sign (26 cards), the black princely families with cross and spades signs (8 cards each) and the red princely family with the heart sign (6 cards). The royal family&rsquo;s cards are trumps.&#10;&#10;The four players form two teams: the players with the princesses/prince pair and the players without the princesses/prince pair. As a game goal, each team tries to bag more silver winning coins than the opposing team. A total of 240 silver winning coins can be collected in a game round with 12 duels (tricks). The team with at least 121 silver winning coins wins the round and receives victory points in the form of gold coins. Furthermore, additional victory points can be gained through special points.&#10;&#10;The special attraction of the double-headed game is that at the beginning of a new round the players do not know with whom they are playing. Only when the princess and the prince are laid out bit by bit, the picture becomes clearer for the players and the other players recognize in which team they are playing. Each game round is different and takes place in different player combinations. It is forbidden to signal to other players whether you are playing together in a team by verbal utterances or sign language. It is very well allowed to send playful signals to your fellow players by tactically laying out cards (e.g. deliberately re-buttering silver winning points into a duel or not). Bluffing is also allowed here, of course, to create confusion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There are nine public trolley car companies and one government controlled company.  The game also includes eight private companies that are auctioned off at the beginning of the game.  Players struggle to keep their trolley car companies from falling into the government controlled railroad.  The game ends when the $12,000 bank runs out of funds.  The player with the most personal money plus stock share value wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game has eight phases. The first permanent trolley car is the '8'.  Phases 4 and 5 represent the Great Depression and revenue declines during this period of the game in which brown tiles are available.  Brown tiles only contain one station space.  Upgrading a two station space green tile to a single station space brown tile removes a station marker from the board, which simulates trolley companies shrinking during these two phases.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that a board of directors (3 players) controls the government railroad, which is determined by the player that controls the priority deal card from the previous stock round.  This will change at the end of each stock round assuming a different player holds the priority deal card.&#10;&#10;",
