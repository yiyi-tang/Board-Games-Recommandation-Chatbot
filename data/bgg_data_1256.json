    "Description": "In this game two players compete to deduce each other's scoring criteria, and the one who is able to do so first, wins.&#10;&#10;More specifically, each player has a set of nine strips of paper; three each in three colors, with each color having one strip of A's, B's, and C's (or dots, lines, and waves in the second edition). Each player takes three scoring chips at random from a selection of twelve and assigns them point values of +2, +1, or -1.  These criteria will look at the number of intersections of certain combinations, such as A strips crossing B strips, or red strips crossing other red strips.&#10;&#10;The first player begins by playing one of their strips.  The second player continues, placing a strip such that it intersects the first strip.  Each player will then place one additional strip in turn, which must cross at least one strip, and may not make an intersection of more than 2 strips.&#10;&#10;Once this is complete, each player calculates their sore.  They then communicate to their opponent how many times in total their three criteria were triggered, and how many total points were earned.  They only report these 2 numbers in total, and not broken down by each of the three criteria.&#10;&#10;A three-minute deduction phase of the game then begins, as the players try to deduce which three scoring criteria the other player has in which slot.  If a player attempts a guess and is wrong, their opponent secretly looks at one of the unused criteria.&#10;&#10;If neither player guesses correctly, the crossing pattern and scoring results remain, and the players play additional rounds as necessary (up to 4 total rounds) with the same scoring criteria and their remaining strips, until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.&#10;&#10;",

Each one of them is eager to industrialize the planet and generate as much profit as possible before the planet self-destructs.&#10;&#10;To do so, you'll have to explore the planet to grow the map. You'll manage your team to extract resources with factory buildings you've built, and trade resources at the stock market to make money. And above anything else, you'll have to handle cataclysms generated by the planet. But cataclysms don't happen randomly, players trigger them through their actions, using their card set. Confrontation between players will take place through the planet.&#10;&#10;Players will alternately take the leader role for each turn. Each turn follows a specific game turn sequence. Every player will have some actions to accomplish at a turn, in the order the Leader chooses, resolving the sequence : Resources production - Action (Explore, Move, Construct, Trade&hellip;) - Cataclysms.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game each player will earn victory points based on how much money they have and how many buildings and vehicles they control.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For almost a year, General Eisenhower balanced Allied resources and clashing subordinates as he slowly drove back Field Marshal Karl von Rundstedt&rsquo;s forces, who struggled with Hitler to command his theater forces. In late January 1945 the Rhine was breached and the end of the Third Reich drew nearer.&#10;&#10;D-Day and Beyond is a tense, two-player operational board game covering the European theater from the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts to the dense German forests, the Siegfried line, and the Rhine River.  The Allied player faces the tough decision about where and when to land troops, what scarce air and naval resources to employ on offense or defense, and struggles to keep a coherent supply line to his forward troops.  The German player has to throw the landing(s) off the beach, if able, and failing that, fight a retrograde war that requires balancing holding key terrain, slowing the Allied advance, and preserving units.  Additional rules showcase the Resistance, rail movement, airborne operations, carpet bombing, the release of German reserves, and the infamous Wacht Am Rhein offensive known as Autumn Mist.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A fast paced, squad level miniatures wargame rich in tactical decision making. Take control of either the highly trained human forces, United Nations of Earth Commandos or the fearless machine forces comprised of G12 Nightmare robots and the dreaded Mark VII Assault Fiend. Various scenarios are included in the boxed set which you win by completing the mission objectives.&#10;&#10;Legions of Steel is played over a series of rounds each comprised of an Initiative Segment, 2 player turns and an end segment. At the beginning of each Round the players roll a d6, higher roller winning initiative. The player with the initiative decides who will have the first turn this round, themselves or their opponent. The person whose turn it is, is considered the active player.&#10;&#10;The active player activates each of their figures moving and attacking. Once a figure has been activated and its actions are finished, a marker is place next to that figure to indicate its state. If the figure attacked, a fired counter is placed next to it. If it did not fire, it is considered Covering which means that it is holding its attack for future use, including during the opponent's turn. Attacking at an opponent is accomplished through rolling a 6 sided die (sometimes more depending on the weapon and your tactical decision). There are various options for attacks including auto-firing, spreading your attack to multiple targets, hand to hand engagement and more that add to the tactical decision process. In addition, some figures have special abilities like Leadership or Extra Lives. With leadership a Sergeant figure can influence die results, allow troopers to move farther or command them to attack out of turn. The Mark VII Assault fiend has an extra life as it takes 2 hits to eliminate it from the game.&#10;&#10;The tactical decisions in this game are many with plenty of player interaction. You will be jockeying your forces for tactical advantage, trying to get the upper hand from round to round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this horror/dark fantasy solitaire card game with a philosophical/mystical story, a player represents a soul trying to break free from the cycle of nightmarish incarnations by enduring the right sequence of them, building an octave from cosmic tones, and getting to the higher, more peaceful level of being. He or she chooses from different cards with letters from A to G, depending on how much hostile each card is and if it fits the sequence he or she has already built. Every card represents an incarnation of the soul into a nightmarish life and the soul must endure them.&#10;&#10;Each card harms the player in a different way and works with the pile or his hand in a different way depending on simple symbols with numbers on the cards (resources are: willpower, represented by a counter card to be covered by another card; and a number of the cards in the pile). There are also &quot;keepers&quot; in the game, tough bosses that prevent you from achieving your goal. The game is balanced in such a way, that usually loss lies very close to winning, and winning is quite hard (easy to play, hard to win). The game setting is just a few seconds  (setting only four &quot;desperate cry&quot; cards that can help you in desperate situations during the game; 1 willpower counter card; and shuffling the pile) and each game is only 10-30 minutes.&#10;&#10;The game mechanism is based on using cards with the same letters or symbols (besides a letter, each card has a symbol or set of symbols too) to recycle them if you do not need the particular card at the moment or if you even need to get rid of it (in case of the keepers).&#10;&#10;It consists of 40 full-colored cards, with a focus on dark art. No other components needed. The game has its own soundtrack in the Dungeon Synth genre.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Crownfall is a 2-4 player game where players take turns flicking their army of Blinks at their opponent&rsquo;s Blinks to try to knock them out of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;CHOOSE YOUR BATTLEFIELD&#10;First, choose a smooth surface such as a floor or tabletop to be your battlefield, and set the boundaries of your arena (the edges of the table, or lines on the ground). Then create a real or imaginary line to divide the battlefield in half and choose a side. This determines where you can place your army during&#10;the game.&#10;&#10;ASSEMBLE YOUR ARMY&#10;Next, take an even number of Blinks and divide them in half between the players. If playing with more than 2 people, players will need to group up into 2 teams.&#10;&#10;Each team clusters their Blinks together and then single-clicks any Blink to swap between the two team colors.&#10;To muster an army, triple-click any Blink in the cluster to turn it into a Crown. All other Blinks will become the army. Blinks will assign themselves one of 9 roles depending on how many Blinks they are away from the Crown Blink. As you play, try to find a unique setup formation that creates your &#10;perfect strategic army.&#10;&#10;Finally, each team distributes their army throughout their side of the battlefield, making sure that no two Blinks are touching. The game then begins with the starting player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;The goal of Crownfall is to reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Crown to 0 health. Each turn, a player can perform up to 2 actions. A player can use one or both of their actions to flick one of their Blinks, generally with the goal of knocking enemy Blinks off the table, but sometimes to accomplish other strategic ends. Unless otherwise specified, a player cannot flick or activate the ability of the same Blink more than once in the same turn.&#10;&#10;Players can also choose to activate the power of one of their army Blinks as an action. Many roles have a power that can be activated with an action, but several have passive powers which do not require an action. All powers are detailed at the end of the rules. If, during play, a Blink connects to another Blink, you must separate the two by 1 inch and rotate them so that they are no longer aligned to each other. Some powers may affect this rule.&#10;&#10;If a Blink falls off the table or out of the bounds of the battlefield as the result of a flick, whether intentional or by accident, that Blink is dead - unless it&rsquo;s a Crown or affected by a special ability. Set your dead Blinks to the side, out of the battlefield&rsquo;s boundary but within reach of the players.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION&#10;The first player to lower their opponent&rsquo;s Crown to 0 health wins!&#10;&#10;To reset your army and start a new game - cluster your Blinks together and triple-click one of them to reset the cluster back to setup.&#10;&#10;VARIANT RULES&#10;Crownfall has multiple rule variations and alternative modes of play. For all variations and a more in-depth explanation of the rules, see the full instructions document online at blinks.games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bang! Bang! is a two player strategy skirmish game where you go head to head as commanders leading your squad of soldiers onto a battlefield in an attempt to eliminate each other. The only tools at your disposal are the Combat Card, your wits, and the roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;The game is split into three phases. You begin in the Spawn Phase, placing your squad onto the map, choosing carefully where to set them along the orange spawn clicks. Clicks are the spots on the board used to determine movement. Once both players finish the Spawn Phase, you then enter the first Move Phase. Start by taking your units using a limited number of moves out of their spawn while attempting to establish line of sight so you can take shots at the enemy. Both players go through one Move phase without firing shots. After your second Move Phase is finished, you enter the Kill Phase and get to take any shots you have available by rolling the dice. Once your Kill phase is over, the turn goes to your opponent, and he gets to do the same by Moving then Killing.&#10;&#10;Each class of soldier is unique and has an ideal range for engagement. The Sniper and Light Machine Gun are best from a distance, the Shotgun and Sub-Machine Gun are great up close, and the Assault Rifle has a sweet spot in the middle.&#10;&#10;The Combat Card details every soldier's stats, and will show you what you need to roll to land a killshot. After you've taken your shots, any soldiers you hit get the chance to roll for cover, and if they make it, will stay alive and get to keep fighting!&#10;&#10;Bang! Bang! uses a classic Deathmatch win condition, so the first person to fully eliminate the enemy squad wins. It comes with three maps of varying difficulty, giving players a fresh battle experience as they improve.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The German invasion of Demark and Norway, Operation Weser&#197;&#177;bung, was a bold gamble by the invaders. The greatest risk for the Germans was at the northern most all weather port of Narvik. Here the Germans landed troops that quickly overwhelmed the local Norwegian garrison but left them entirely dependent upon supplies and reinforcements that would arrive by ship or air transport. The Allies recognized the German&rsquo;s vulnerability and sent the Royal Navy into the Narvik fjord where their warships quickly sank all of the German vessels. With winter weather persisting, air transport would never be able to provide sufficient levels of men and material to sustain the now trapped German invaders. The Allies sent a mixed nationality force of British, French and Poles to support the Norwegian defense forces that were laying siege to the Germans. What resulted was an epic contest that threatened to unravel the Nazi blitzkrieg. Perhaps you can do as well or better?&#10;&#10;Each copy of A Cold and Resolute Fight is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch map sheets&#10;&bull;    One sheet of 120 double-sided counters&#10;&bull;    This set of rules.&#10;&#10;Players will also need a standard deck of cards, one six-sided die (D6) and an opaque container (mug, envelope or anything similar) to play the game.&#10;&#10;Most units are battalions of 700 to 800 men and their equipment (German KG are slightly smaller). Tank units represent 6-10 vehicles. A turn represents one week of time and a hex is slightly more than 2.5 miles across.&#10;&#10;A Cold and Resolute Fight is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Nils Johansson.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

This gives Triathlon 9 unique sets of cards. Each set has eight cards, 7 numbered cards, and a Pro Card. Pro Cards are wild in number but cannot change their color or suit.&#10;&#10;In addition to the cards mentioned above, the deck also contains three Super Pro Cards that are wild in number and color, but cannot change their suit.&#10; -description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Any other player with a greed card on top of their pile scores the same amount as the active player.&#10;&#10;After a player has played a greed card they must play on their own pile next turn to cover it.&#10;&#10;",

As well as summarising the history, this book also details a number of scenarios inspired by the engagements within the Normandy campaign, and the special rules required to play them.&#10;&#10;This book tells the story of the British and Canadian contribution to this monumental task, and the stoic German resistance they faced. It guides Bolt Action players from the latter stages of D-Day, beginning with the fierce fighting in the coastal towns off the beaches at Gold, Juno and Sword, through the violent clashes around the strategically vital city of Caen, and to the march against Germany itself.&#10;&#10;Inside, you&rsquo;ll find thirteen diverse scenarios, covering the action from the first pushes inland, to the dramatic climax of the campaign in the British &amp; Canadian sectors during Operation&#226;&#128;&#175;Tractable.&#226;&#128;&#175; We&rsquo;ve also included army lists for four of the campaign&rsquo;s most important forces &ndash; the Canadian Army, the battle-hardened Commandos, the fanatical 12th SS Panzer Division &lsquo;Hitlerjugend&rsquo;, and the Luftwaffe Field Division. These new army lists add a whole new dimension of play, allowing you to create themed forces for your campaigns in Normandy!&#10;&#10;Also included is a whole stable of new special characters, including the VC-winning medic Corporal Frederick Topham, who put life and limb on the line to rescue wounded men, and the fanatical Kurt &lsquo;Panzer&rsquo; Meyer, who earned his Iron Cross leading the &#226;&#128;&#175;Liebstandarte&#226;&#128;&#175;division&rsquo;s reconnaissance battalion in Russia. These special characters are the perfect opportunity to theme your force further and make for amazing conversion opportunities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Medieval Mayhem, a co-op game for 2-4 players, play the role of 4 heroes: Rogre, Emera, Gallandor, and Kijam as they attempt to rescue all 24 villagers from the dragon Malevol. Actions include moving, rescuing, transferring, and dropping off villagers. Work together and utilize cards from the deck as well as hero effects!&#10;&#10;Contents include 24 Meeples, 8 Player Tokens, 4 Hero Cards, 16 Location Cards, 16 Action Cards, and 1 Rulebook.&#10;&#10;INTRODUCTION&#10;Malevol, the fabled wicked dragon, has emerged and has his eyes set on villagers. Four brave heroes: Rogre, Emera, Kijam, and Gallandor, must rescue the villagers and drop them off in Farlorn Village. However, if Malevol emerges, and the heroes aren&rsquo;t on Safe Haven spaces while rescuing villagers, the villagers will die! An orc, a mage, a knight, and an elf must team up to save the villagers from Malevol&rsquo;s wrath!&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;Your team must rescue 16 of the 24 villagers. Use action cards and hero effects to help make the objective easier!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Select a player to go first, then play proceeds to the left. A player may perform (3) actions in any order of their choosing. Actions:&#10;&#10;Move: Move your token one space vertically or horizontally (diagonal is not allowed).  Your piece must move onto a Location Card your first turn and may never leave the game area again.&#10;&#10;Transfer: When two players&rsquo; tokens occupy the same Location Card, a transfer may occur.  You may give one Villager that has been rescued to the other player.  Each transfer costs one Action.&#10;&#10;Rescue: A player&rsquo;s token must occupy the same space as the villager being rescued. When moving, be sure to move the villager next to your token.&#10;&#10;Drop-Off: When you get to the Village, perform a Drop-Off action to ensure the villager is same from harm.&#10;&#10;Each player has one turn each round. After the round ends, reveal a card from the Action Deck. If it is an Action Card, any player may add it to their hand and play it on any of their next turns at no extra action cost. Action cards are discarded after use. However, if it is Malevol, anyone who does not occupy a Safe Haven Location Card will lose 1 villager, then shuffle Malevol back into the Action Card deck. Lost villagers are removed from the game. Each player has an effect that may be used during the game; this does not cost an action to use and can be used any time when applicable. NOTE: Unless otherwise stated, only 1 villager can be rescued per Hero card before drop-off.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;The game ends when 16 villagers have been rescued and dropped off at the village; in this case, your team wins! The game will also end if 9 villagers die from Malevol; in this case, your team loses.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Some always tell the truth, some always lie, some always do what they're told, and some always do the opposite of what they're told.&#10;&#10;16 of each of four colors of pieces are placed on the 64 spaces of the board, which has the property that any two spaces have a unique shortest path between them. Each round someone decides which color of piece represents which type of person and also picks one of the liars to be Quigley. The other players have to find Quigley.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player may move their piece up to three spaces and then asks the person there how to reach Quigley. A die is rolled to determine if they are told to lie or not, but how they actually answer of course also depends on what type of person they are. The controller for the round places an arrow pointing along the shortest path to Quigley - or not. The arrow is white if the die said to tell the truth and black otherwise.&#10;&#10;Alternatively a player may ask a person if they are Quigley, in which case they always receive a truthful answer. The player finding Quigley scores 20 points. An incorrect accusation costs 5 points. The controller scores a point every time a player takes a turn.&#10;&#10;",

It is going to take the Federal government to restore a city's ability to govern itself. Newly elected President Herbert Hoover wants to clean up the city and that means bringing down the most notorious gangster of the time, Al Capone. It would take two years, but Hoover got his wish. In June 1931, federal prosecutors indicted Capone on 22 counts of income-tax evasion.&#10;&#10;Scarface: The Al Capone Trial, puts you in the hands of the prosecution or defense to bring this gangster to justice or remind the justice system that a kind word and a gun...is still king.&#10;&#10;As the defense, your efforts are asymmetrical focused on using cards and dice drafting to bribe and intimidate, jury tamper and cut deals to keep Capone from being convicted.&#10;&#10;As the prosecution, you maintain the straight and narrow using cards and dice drafting to argue that Capone is guilty of a majority of tax evasion counts.&#10;&#10;To win, the defense must build up enough corruption to make it to the end of trial simulating winning over public opinion, whereas the prosecution must win the game before the trial comes to a close by stringing together key evidence, convincing a majority of the jurors or prove witness tampering.&#10;&#10;This is a standalone game. It is volume 3 in the Trial Series by Green Feet Games (previous Volumes includes Unforgiven: The Lincoln Assassination Trial and Prophet Without Honor: The Billy Mitchell Court-martial).&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Medium A Mind-Reading Party Game&#10;DESTINY REVEALED PROMO&#10;If a team senses that their minds are in tune, they can tempt fate by playing the new ESP card Destiny Revealed. At the start of a team's turn, instead of playing word cards from their hands, one partner may play the top two cards of the deck and use those two cards as their starting words for the turn.  If they can't match on the first try, they proceed with their turn as normal, using the words they just said.  But, if they are so in tune that they Mind Meld on the first attempt, they'll get two First Attempt Mind Meld tokens instead of one!&#10;&#10;",

All other cards are shuffled and each player gets a hand (of 12, 10, or 8 depending on player count). Each player also gets one counter of each color.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player may trade, meaning they may turn in any number of counters and then take counters equal in value; the values are determined by the cards on the table. A player also must play a card, which will change the value of the associated color; this can be done before or after trading.&#10;&#10;When all cards have been played the game is over. Players score a point for each counter and four more points for each set of all four colors.&#10;&#10;",
