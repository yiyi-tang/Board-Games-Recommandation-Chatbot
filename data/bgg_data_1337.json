First the player with the action marker performs up to 2 actions (Authorize, Riot, Swap or Escort). These typically involve selecting villagers to be admitted to the city and moving them forward. Following this, the reset player is responsible for maintaining the flow of villagers towards the city, but may also choose to abandon the rescue efforts by retreating the defending knights instead.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either all villagers have been saved or too many knights have retreated from the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Scores are a total of villagers rescued, hidden objectives, end game bonuses and rating. The player with the most influence points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A kingdom on the crossroads gets invaded by its greedy neighbours. On the brink of defeat, its wizards launch the final retaliation - they open a rift to the realms of chaos. Mighty demons with their servants swarm the land, turning it into waste. The invading kingdoms face an opponent they are not ready for. Regular armies are helpless against horrors of wraiths, turning people into possessed who fight against their own kind. Only elite units, heroes and battle mages dare to face the dark forces. The goal is to buy time for the archmages to prepare a spell that would close the rift. The help might come too late - if the destruction of the lands is too severe, people will abandon hope and wait defenceless for the doom.&#10;&#10;Players - alone or in 2-player teams - take the role of chaos forces and the defending kingdoms. The chaos has the upper hand - they decide which kingdom will be invaded and with which forces. The defenders have to predict the attack directions and send their forces there. They are not completely blind - their scouts and clairvoyants can detect enemy&rsquo;s movements. Chaos forces crave resources that are spread across the land - this also gives hints where they would like to strike. Some kingdoms are more vulnerable - or resistant - against some types of attacks, but the best strike is often the most obvious one. Both sides have to raise new armies - their starting forces need reinforcements as the units need rest after every battle. Both sides have also to deal with casualties that come with every war.&#10;&#10;Chaos forces need resources taken from the lands to raise new armies and launch the attacks. As their domain gets bigger, the conquered sources of resources get depleted. Chaos armies can pillage the lands for additional resources but this comes at the cost of precious time.&#10;&#10;This is where the game starts - chaos leaders have seven rounds of time to destroy the most vital parts of the kingdoms, so that any help from the archmages comes too late. They have to find a way to plan successful attacks deceiving the defenders. Defending players have to deduct chaos assaults and counter them. Wrong guess of direction gives an opportunity to fortify the borders against future attack. Wrong choice of the defending unit still slows the opponent down. Right unit at the right border will stop the invasion - at least once.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed for funraising in the Netherlands for a local Kiwanis group. The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case a geographic region in the Netherlands around the city Axel.&#10;&#10;Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.&#10;&#10;Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.&#10;&#10;Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.&#10;&#10;The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:&#10;- After a set time.&#10;- When the first player becomes bankrupt.&#10;- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, the bloodied dead body suggests there are one too many guests. Was it a jealous lover? Or filthy blackmail? Or plain old fashioned Envy? This is the bloody 1920's at its worst.&#10;&#10;Envy is a printable escape room game that transforms any space into a 1920's Gatsby style murder mystery escape room experience. What's it like? Well, imagine what would happen if you mixed an escape room and a house party in a cocktail shaker. That's Envy.&#10;&#10;This printable escape room kit combines the teamwork, tension, and puzzle-solving of escape rooms with the laidback ease of group party games. Players will work together to solve the mystery of Lord Carnegie&rsquo;s murder, before time runs out. Gameplay is centered on a series of puzzle sheets hidden around the room. Each puzzle solved puts you one step closer to cuffing the killer red-handed (literally&hellip; there&rsquo;s blood everywhere!).&#10;&#10;Game setup is quick and spoiler-free, and hints are handled by an online hint system that players access on their smartphones. This means that no game master is required to supervise the experience, so you can join the game alongside your players.&#10;&#10;The game can expand to accommodate any number of players by dividing your group into teams of 2-4, and then pitting them against each other to see who finishes the game first. In addition, you can edit the game file before printing to customize your own escape room experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Cheese Royale you will become a little mouse in the middle of the field, where you will fight against hunger, traps and the rest of mice, to be able to get hold of the central cheese.&#10;&#10;The game map consists of 37 tiles:  All the tiles, except the starter and the central cheese, are placed face down on the map so that they cannot be seen. Each mouse at the beginning of the game has a starting life and food and its corresponding attack and defense values. Each mouse has also a different ability.&#10;&#10;The main objective of the game is to be the last surviving mouse. The game is divided into rounds, in which each player has 2 actions to perform in his turn. At the beginning of each round an event card is revealed and it can affect the whole round, such as reduction of the map at the end of the round. In this case, the last layer of tiles is removed from the map making it smaller.&#10;&#10;Actions that can be performed in your turn:&#10;&#10;     Sniff: View the content of a tile without executing its content. &#10;     Move: Move to adjacent tile, if it is face down, the tile is turned over and its content is executed. &#10;     Attacking: When  attacking, the attacker's values and the defender's values are compared, that is, base characteristics of mouse, its equipment and the fight cards used in combat. If the attacker wins, he gets a fight card reward and the opponent loses a life. In case if the defender wins, he gets a reward from fighting cards and has the possibility to counterattack.&#10;     Rest: if you have excess actions you can rest to get fight cards or food.&#10;&#10;&#10;After taking your 2 actions, your turn ends and you consume 1 food from your supply. If you don't have food, you lose one life.&#10;If a mouse reaches 0 life, it's eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "No one knows when or whence it came. Or what the first symptoms were. Some say that it is an ancient curse laid upon the land. That it goes back to the earliest settlements. That you can still hear it in the screams of every newborn babe.&#10;&#10;In Pesta players take on the roles of the last remaining residents in a village plagued by evil omens portending a terrible disease. They must dispel the omens to prevent the disease from reaching the well that sustains the village. Each turn the disease infects a new space, and if players are not careful to keep down the mounting piles of corpses, it spreads even faster. To make matters worse, villagers quickly lose hope against the impossible odds, turning once capable hands into little more than shivering appendages.&#10;&#10;Players take turns inflicting random doom upon the village and trying to counter it by claiming and activating villagers. Activated villagers can move a variable number of spaces and perform any number of tasks in them as long as they can pay the cost. If a villager ever finds themselves on an infected space, they immediately become hopeless and lose access to their special ability. They also become susceptible to succumbing to their inevitable fate, ending up as just another corpse on the street.&#10;&#10;The only source of light in this very long and narrow tunnel is the omen cards that players can claim as prizes after dispelling them. The cards can be used to take additional actions or decide the fate of the hopeless. Will they return hopeful from the abyss, sacrifice themselves on the pyre, or venture into the wilderness and leave the damned village behind?&#10;&#10;Pesta is the third and final installment in the Trilogy of Lost Hope. The two previous installments are Tower of Silence and Iron Mountain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The AI takeover is upon us. It's as bad as we feared.&#10;&#10;Robot Rising is a solo deck-building game where you must program the bots (cards) in your hand to quell the AI takeover. Each turn, new bots may join the uprising, making it more difficult to regain control. Use Config Settings to maintain your bot population, keep your Code clean to avoid compromising CPUs, and Install USBs with data patches to regain control of mutinous bots. Can you find a way to keep the robots from rising to power? Humankind depends on it...&#10;&#10;Your objective is to regain control of all the bot cards in the Uprising deck to quell the rebellion before the bots compromise ten CPU chips and take control of the world.&#10;&#10;Each bot card in Robot Rising has a helpful ability when you control the bot, and a separately harmful effect when the bot instead joins the uprising.  The game is played in rounds until you've either defeated all bots in the uprising or the bots have hacked all your CPU control.&#10;&#10;Each round, you start by rolling a die - the Bot Roll - any card in the population with a matching value will join the uprising, and is another bot you will have to regain control of in order to win.  Next, the active bots in the uprising take actions based on the bottom of the card. After the uprising bots have finished their turn, you may use the bots in your control to fight back.  You can Code lines (improve your health), Install patches in uprising bots (each bot requires a certain amount of USBs before falling), gain Configuration Settings (the game's currency), and lots more!  At the conclusion of each turn, you may acquire bots from the population if you have adequate Config to do so.&#10;&#10;Robot Rising was designed for the 2021 54-Card Game Design Contest on BGG&#10;&#10;",

So it's up to you if you want to risk playing your &quot;leftover pizza&quot; card when the category is &quot;Stuff that you can fix with glue&quot;. On the count of 3 everyone places their chosen cards face down. Whoever has played the most must reveal their selection and justify why each card fits the category. The other players all vote whether the selection is acceptable or not. If the majority vote yes, that player gets a point for each card as normal, but if the majority is no, they get no points for that round.&#10;&#10;All used cards are discarded and everyone redraws to 7 for the next round.

Solaris heroes will want the influence type to be Sol at the end of the game, while Lunaris heroes will want it to be the Luna type. Neutralis heroes will want to keep the influence level low, no matter the type.&#10;&#10;Then, each player will draft 9 Prestations cards, pick one of them and pass the rest of the pack to the next player. Players will again have to pick a card from that now 8 cards pack, and pass the rest to the next player, and so on until there is no cards to pass.&#10;&#10;Finally, players will play 1 card at their turn. Most cards will help raise or lower the influence level, but some of them can make a player skip a turn, cancel another card effect or power up another one.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no card to play, or if the influence level reach 20 (or more). Then, the winners are decided depending on the type and level of the influence.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Dans ce jeu &eacute;pique de cartes pixelis&eacute;es, les joueurs utiliseront des cartes pour augmenter ou diminuer le niveau d'influence du village, en essayant de s'emparer d'une puissante pierre mythique, l'Atris Lucidum. Mais avant cela, les joueurs choisiront secr&egrave;tement une carte H&eacute;ros des l&eacute;gendes, qui modifie l'objectif en fonction du h&eacute;ros choisi. Les h&eacute;ros Solaris voudront que le type d'influence soit Sol &agrave; la fin de la partie, tandis que les h&eacute;ros Lunaris voudront que ce soit le type Luna. Les h&eacute;ros Neutralis voudront que le niveau d'influence reste bas, quel que soit le type.&#10;&#10;Ensuite, chaque joueur va tirer 9 cartes Prestations, en choisir une et passer le reste du paquet au joueur suivant. Les joueurs devront &agrave; nouveau choisir une carte dans ce paquet de 8 cartes, et passer le reste au joueur suivant, et ainsi de suite jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'il n'y ait plus de cartes &agrave; passer.&#10;&#10;Enfin, les joueurs joueront une carte &agrave; leur tour. La plupart des cartes permettent d'augmenter ou de diminuer le niveau d'influence, mais certaines d'entre elles peuvent faire sauter un tour &agrave; un joueur, annuler un effet de carte ou en renforcer un autre.&#10;&#10;Le jeu se termine lorsqu'un joueur n'a plus de carte &agrave; jouer, ou si le niveau d'influence atteint 20 (ou plus). Ensuite, les gagnants sont d&eacute;sign&eacute;s en fonction du type et du niveau d'influence.&#10;&#10;",

Created in partnership with the NBA and NBPA, FLEX NBA lets fans play as their favorite NBA players, using their FLEX 'superpowers' to take down opponents!&#10;&#10;The game comes with 10 NBA player tiles, from which each of the 2 players drafts a team of 5 tiles. Players also have the option to purchase expansion sets that include additional NBA player tiles so that they can build their collections. Players don't need to watch actual NBA games in order to play the game. The game mechanic itself is similar to many other TCG's out there (although because of our NBA license we can't call ourselves a TCG - hence why we refer to ourselves as a BTG - battle tile game).&#10;&#10;Once players have assembled their lineups, they then take turns rolling the play action die and taking actions based upon the results of the roll. There are additional status FX tiles that enhance the player's move set and give them various competitive advantages. With many of the moves that a player makes (aka Flexes), they will whittle down the other player's confidence points (health) until the opponent's team is depleted of CP.&#10;&#10;The mobile companion app integration serves 2 primary purposes - 1) it is necessary to view the player tiles' AR animations, and 2) it is necessary if players wish to register the unique bar codes on their player tiles to our database and thereby claim ownership (per our NBA license, we cannot use the words NFT or blockchain, but that's what it actually is).&#10;&#10;",

A player will start by choosing a Hero card, deciding what Play Style (class) they want, and a fill-in story card. Each fill-in story card has fill-in the blank lines that you will choose a word for based off of what cards you draw each turn. The games lasts for 6 chapters (rounds).&#10;&#10;Depending on their Play Style, the player will draw different cards. They then decide if they want to trade cards, and if they have any cards they can match to be able to unlock the letter for that chapter's story. If they don't unlock a letter, they can spend a mimo (action point) at the end of their turn to buy one. You get 4 mimos each turn, and if you don't use any or all of them, they carry over to the next chapter.&#10;&#10;Then, every player draws a monster card, Magicians will try to befriend the monster, Collectors will try to collect them and Warriors will try to fight them.&#10;&#10;You win by succeeding in as many monster encounters as possible, the monsters add to your Hero's overall strength. Whatever mimos you have left over by the 6th chapter also add to your Hero's strength. The 6th chapter card is a Boss Monster, you defeat it with your accumulated strength.&#10;&#10;",

Wait until the time is right to make the cards go poof...make your move...get the upper hand.&#10;&#10;Short-script gameplay: Players play cards equal to or lower than the player before them in clockwise rotation until they run out of cards. All the cards left in a player's hand at the end of a round get added up to their total score and the person with the lowest score at the end of 7 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong! There are hidden cards in a player's hand that aren't revealed until the card on top of them has been played. There is also the magic of the &quot;POOF!&quot; Whether it's a Poof card or playing a 4 of a kind, players have the opportunity to re-set the cards in the playing area and start over with any number they'd like!&#10;&#10;",
