This large gap allowed Dumenko&rsquo;s three cavalry brigades and a few armor cars to advance unopposed by any White forces. It was only 40 miles from Tsaritsyn. The steppe was perfect for such an advance, flat as hell, providing no cover but fast transit for the cavalry. While White forces did occupy some of Tsaritsyn, there were none in the White rear areas. The closest forces were the 2nd Kuban Cavalry Corps (6000 men) but over a day away. The British B Flight of the 47th RAF led by Lt.

    "Description": "If you are interested in short filler card or board games, or portable boardgames to bring along on travel trips, then the Rainbow Deck is for you! It is basically a 100-games-in-1 cardgame system. &#10; The Rainbow Deck (RD) 4.0 is a cardgame system that has a total of 162 cards. There are 12 suits with each suit having 13 ranks, and total 6 Joker cards. The suits are represented by colour and digit. The ranks are from 0 to 9, J to K. The cards are also numbered at one corner from 0 to 119, and another corner having alphabet letters. At the center of the card, there is a picture and word for playing picture or word related games. Surrounding the picture are 4 triangles for playing path-laying games.&#10;&#10;The RD can be adapted to play a variety of modern designer games, like what a deck of playing cards does for traditional cardgames. The difference is that the RD has 8 more suits, numbers from 0 to 119 as well as alphabet letters, thus it is most suitable for playing abstract games that require numbers, colours or letters. It can also be used by game designers as components in their own prototype games. Players can also combine the RD with other boardgames with components having colours, numbers or letters to form new games!&#10;&#10;The RD can be complemented by 6 colours x 27 chips, 6 coloured dice and 6 coloured pawns/meeples. This allows playing of cardgames that require chips, dice or pawns. The chips can be marked using permanent markers with the corresponding values on one side. Also, the cardbacks have a 2x2 checkerboard pattern and they can be used to form boards which, together with the chips and pawns, can be used to play a variety of abstract games.&#10;&#10;Decks that the RD can be mapped into&#10;&#10;     Sequence of numbers of 0 to 119&#10;     Letters with values similar to Letter Head&#10;     12 suits (colour/number) x 1-13 values&#10;     6 suits (icon) x 1-23 values (2x10+3)&#10;     6 suits (icon) x 2 copies of 1-13 values&#10;     12 suits (colour/number) x 2 copies of 1-6 dice values&#10;     6 suits (icon) x 4 copies of 1-6 dice values &#10;     6 suits (icon) x 26 letter cards&#10;     n * 26 letter cards + rare letter cards&#10;     1 copy x value 1,..., 12 copies x value 12(Q), 13 copies x value 13(K+joker)&#10;     Double-Nine domino set x 2 copies&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Rainbow Deck - A Deck for Infinite Games!&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Interesting idea. Could spawn ideas for several new card games.&quot; -monteselu&#10;&#10;&quot;An excellent accessory. While the deck's hybrid design often makes it not quite the perfect tool for the job, it's a good tool for so *many* jobs that it's got a permanent place in my traveling game box. I especially like the Rainbow Deck Deluxe, which greatly expands the number of available games.&quot; -timstellmach&#10;&#10;&quot;What intrigues me about the Rainbow Deck is that it's the first project of its kind that I've seen the boardgaming community show much enthusiasm for. Thus, there is some hope that people may use it and it will stick around long enough to become some kind of standard.&quot; -rwhe&#10;&#10;&quot;The amount of thought that has gone into the design of this deck is amazing.&quot; -ryanker&#10;&#10;&quot;I just ordered mine, this is an awesome idea...It's like a Swiss Army Knife of card game systems.&quot; -chad78&#10;&#10;&quot;I love this deck, such a novel idea!&quot; -Rutibex&#10;&#10;&quot;Love this deck. It gets my creative juices flowing just interacting with them.&quot; - Drivethrucards customer&#10;&#10;&quot;Has a lot of potential for playing a large variety of games.&quot; -HarryPouncer&#10;&#10;&ldquo;...the shear ambition of the design is what makes it special. What makes it stand out is that it is pushing the limit of how much a playing card can accomplish.&rdquo; -mtross&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Really cool idea! I've used it a few times now and am really enjoying being able to get some out of print card games played.&rdquo; - Drivethrucards customer&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Amazing work ! I've printed the 4th edition which bring great design and useful abilities (path and word game based like Saboteur and Code Name for instance). Perfect to bring with you in hollydays for a small package. It should replace classic 54 card game in supermarket...&rdquo; - Ic3monkey&#10;&#10;",

Each team takes turns using three pennies to work their way across the board to score in the opponents goal. The goal is created by the defending team placing two fingers (both index/ index pinky) against the side of the table creating a goal for the offense to score in. The offense moves across the table by setting the coins in a tight triangle position and flicks the rear most coin through the other two coins. The flicked coin must pass through the other two and play continues by flicking a coin in play between the other two continually without disturbing either one until a goal is scored (by getting a penny in the goal), a coin goes off the table, the coin fails to make it through the other two, or the coin contacts one of the other two. At this point roles are reversed. Play continues to a predetermined score (suggest 5 or 10).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game consists of tile which either show a docked space ship or  a flying one. The active player flips open a tile. If it is a docked ship, he/she places a pilot's chip on it and asks another player to place a copilot's chip as well. Then everyone closes their eyes and the active player hides the ship in the room (some rules to make this easier apply). When the tile shows a flying ship, the player has to find that ship in the room within a certain time - if successful, he/she gets the chips inside (and a bonus chip if his/her own pilot/copilot was flying). Whoever gets most chips is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

One player starts an attack by secretly choosing two chips which have a result (there are different sets for addition, subtraction etc.) that is on one of the fields in the first row of the board. The opponent does the same. If they reach the same result, the attack is stopped, the other player attacks and both players take back their chips. If not, the attack proceeds to the second row, etc. If the attack isn't stopped by the fourth row, the attacking player can try to flip the ball chip into the defending player's goal, thus scoring a goal. Whoever has scored more goals at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
