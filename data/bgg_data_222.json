Hex control and unit loyalties are the primary components to winning. Militia, regular Russian army and Ministry of the Interior units start the game without having any particular identification, indicative of the confusion and fluidity inherent in the opening phases of the conflict, while the Elite units are more crucial to determining the course of any new civil war in Russia and bear the specific I.D.s of their real-world counterparts. A player can bid with VPs to change the loyalties of elite units. Militia is converted by occupation of a city through advance after combat.&#10;&#10;There are 240 counters, most of which represent combat units of the Russian army and Ministry of the Interior heavy and airborne divisions, along with their elite air assault, special forces and naval infantry brigades, and ad hoc revolutionary militia formations. The map is scaled to 20 miles per hex side to side. Each game turn represents three days.&#10;&#10;",

Instead of donating this to museums, they decide to organize unusual auctions amongst themselves to distribute the spoils.&#10;&#10;The innovative bid mechanism is that players cannot bid a number whose &quot;ones&quot; digit matches the number on any card they have previously won. Thus, if you have cards showing &quot;2&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, you cannot bid 2, 4, 12, 14, 22, etc. What's more, when someone wins an auction, the money is paid out to those owning a card whose number matches the &quot;ones&quot; digit of the winning bid. Thus, while you need to acquire cards in order to win the game, you don't want to enrich your opponents too much.&#10;&#10;Templari differs from the earlier releases Don and Serengeti in that the game has a maximum count of five players, all players start with twelve coins, and in each round players bid on lots of exactly two cards (whereas in earlier versions, the lots would have one, then two, then three cards, then back to one).&#10;&#10;",

During a player's turn they will roll 5 dice with unique symbols on each side, after rolling they have the option of re-rolling 3 more times.  If the &quot;Monster&quot; symbol is rolled on a die it is locked and cannot be re-rolled.  If 3 Monster symbols appear a new gate opens and a monster appears in Arkham.  The other sides of the dice include movement points, clue tokens (used to close gates), healing, and combat symbols (used when fighting the monsters guarding the gates).  Each player must carefully choose how to use their symbols to move around and try to close and collect six gates.  If six gates are open on the board the players automatically lose..  However if the players manage to close six gates Cthulhu awakens and players must try to defeat him with their remaining items and abilities.&#10;&#10;This game is in no small part inspired by Felbrigg Herriot's (FNH1) wonderful Dune Express game.&#10;&#10;",

Cards are worth various amounts of awesomeness, and you want to be the most awesome hero at the end of the third day.&#10;&#10;Awesome Kingdom: Mines &amp; Labyrinths is both a standalone game and an expansion for Awesome Kingdom: The Tower of Hateskull, with two new dungeons for heroes to explore: Cretin's Labyrinth and the Mines of Murray.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts the game with the same drawing deck of tiles (with the only difference being the color of the astronauts on the tiles) of which they draw one, then play one until everyone has only two tiles left.&#10;&#10;When you place a tile, you may connect same-colored areas freely &mdash; there are three tile colors &mdash; but different-colored areas must be separated by laser &quot;walls&quot;, some of which have green &quot;doors&quot; on them. When such a same-colored area is completely enclosed by laser walls, it is evaluated. The player with the most astronauts in the area gets the points; in case of a tie, the points are divided between the players. An area is worth 1 point for each tile and 3 points for each alien there, but what makes the game tricky is that you get these points also for those neighboring areas (not only the closed ones) that are connected by doors to the evaluated area.&#10;&#10;At game end, score 2 points for each astronaut and alien on the tiles you have left. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Union Army is fighting on its own ground and is much more powerful than the Confederate forces, but has difficulty bringing that might to bear. If they can, the war might end sooner. If the Confederates succeed, they might swing Maryland to the Southern side.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Scriba is yet another Scrabble clone. Quite popular on Polish market due to much lower price.&#10;&#10;Scriba is an extended version of Scriba Travel, because it provides two variants of gameplay. The first variant is exactly the same, but the second is quite insane.&#10;&#10;The first variant is similar to Scrabble (but there are some differences). Players use their 6/7/8 (this is up to the players) drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. The differences between Scriba (1st variant) and Scrabble are:&#10;- If you play all but one letter from your rack you get 20 points bonus.&#10;- You can stack the letters on top of the already played (like in Upwords), but only two levels of letters are allowed&#10;- There are negative bonuses on the board.&#10;- The player that ends the game receive 50 points bonus (because he played all his letters, we don't mind if he had one or two).&#10;- If a player passes, he receives minus 5 points.&#10;- The are tiles with no letter but with a black spot. This can be placed anywhere adjacent to already played tiles and is usually used to prevent from extending a particular word.&#10;- The are tiles with a curved arrow (wich looks like 'enter key') which allows to play a word half vertically and half horizontally.&#10;&#10;The second variant uses every rule from first variant with some additional rules:&#10;- The players use chips in four colors to place all the bonuses on the board wherever they want.&#10;- Whenever a player uses the bonus, he takes the chip from the board and places it in front of him. Every chip is worth 1 point during the final scoring.&#10;- The start player does not have to place his first word in the middle of the board.&#10;- After every move the player roll a d6 and draws that number of letter-tiles.&#10;- There are 12 big yellow chips which at the start of the game are distributed to the players in equal shares. Every chip is worth 10 points at the end of the game. Whenever a player plays exactly four letter-tiles from is rack, he can take one big chip from a chosen opponent.&#10;&#10;",

The game ends after 5 rounds. Each player rolls the unidice during their turn. The top and sides of the digital die turn into their own D6 which means you roll a total of 5 dice in one unidice. The dice results range from numbers to senators and revolt. During their turn, a player can reroll and lock and unlock die faces up to 3 times. Since final dice results can give a senator an advantage, they can choose to aim for a certain dice result to overthrow the other players.&#10;&#10;Caesar is a brand new turn-based game you can play with the unidice - a gaming console in the shape of a die. A player can roll/reroll 3 times until the final result is confirmed. The game proceeds automatically to the next player's turn. Automating the roles with the app and unidice makes reading rules becomes almost redundant as you learn the game on the fly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A course constructed in a savage area of turbulent space studded with rotating black holes, fluctuating intense radiation zones, space-time disruption fields and randomly moving hunter-killer mines that will test your piloting skill and courage to the fullest.  Set within this field are a series of Buoys that must be recovered to score victory points.  Some of the Buoys are in fixed positions, others move randomly.  The most valuable of all are the Astaroth, Belial and Lucifer Buoys which are locked in tight orbit in the intense radiation zones surrounding the monstrous Hell2 and Hell3 black holes.  Players must design their ships' maximum function levels in each category of ship operation and must pilot the ship through the treacherous course in the quest of Buoys.  Players must always be aware of the course obstacles, the positions of the other racers, and the remaining fuel supply of their ship.  Demon's Run is a game that is played in a delicate balance between success and disaster.  It is not some simple couple hundred laps around an oval track.  Demon's Run is a wide eyed, full power leap into the mouth of Hell!&#10;&#10;You design your ship before each race by distributing points between Fuel, Structural Integrity, Pilot Integration, Main Engines, Manoeuvre Engines, Tractor (used to recover buoys), Laser (used to attack buoys, mines and other players' ships), Scrambler (used to disorient an opposing player), Screens and Velocity.  Campaign rules are provided so pilots and ships can improve between races.  It is relatively easy to make the game playable by more than four --you need only make up more ship set up sheets and a few counters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The gameplay in Abtei der R&auml;tsel is inspired by &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, but plays much like a variant of Hangman. One card is chosen with a word - either a 10 character word (with the easy cards) or a 5-9 character word with blank spaces distributed throughout (with the difficult cards). The card is placed in a plastic bookshelf, which allows each of the letters (or spaces) in the word to be viewed individually.&#10;&#10;Players then send their monks and novices to collect clues; six clues may be easily obtained from books found around the monastery, but the other four can only be viewed within the locked laboratory. The first player to correctly determine the word wins.&#10;&#10;This game is a redevelopment of Abtei der wandernden B&#195;&#188;cher in a more affordable edition.&#10;&#10;",

Like Mousetrap, the gameboard is dominated (in fact, consists of) a large Rube Goldberg-ish contraption.  Players use a plastic &quot;putter&quot; to flick a small (about 1cm in diameter) ball around a nine-hole miniature golf course.  Some holes require the ball to roll into an elevator which carries it up and dumps it into a spiral track leading to the hole.  Others require the ball to be hit up a ramp into a basketball hoop or rebounded off bumpers.  One hole even consists of a dangling plastic chicken that swings back and forth pendulum-style (a little oil might be useful for this one as there's too much friction as-is for the chicken to swing freely.)  Players have three chances to play each hole.  Whoever sinks their putt in the fewest shots is awarded a token--no tokens awarded for ties.  The ninth hole has two holes, one harder to reach than the other.  Players are awarded one token for sinking their putt into the easy hole, or two for the hard one.  The player with the most tokens wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Foe Hunters is an exciting co-operative, multiplayer deckbuilding/adventure game set in the realm of high fantasy! Players take the role of heroes that are working together to thwart the evil Foe. On their adventure the heroes will work together in an effort to bolster their party and fend off this powerful enemy. The players will harness mighty abilities and powerful equipment while they work as a team to rid the world of this wretched evil!&#10;&#10;Each round starts with the Foe, who is autonomous. The Foe has a set action it takes each turn, and then plays cards from its deck. The cards in the Foe deck include Vassals under its employ that also fight the Heroes, as well as powerful abilities that the Foe will use to damage and weaken the Heroes. At the end of the Foe phase, the party of Heroes may collectively choose a card in the city to refresh, making other options available for the next turn.&#10;&#10;After the Foe phase is complete, the party of Heroes begin their turns. Turn order starts with whoever the party selects. Each Hero turn plays out very simply, they can play a card from their hand, buy a card from the city (using their experience), and use one of their heroic Feats. Each Hero has a completely unique starting deck and plays totally different from each other Hero!&#10;&#10;Play continues until the Foe is defeated or the party is destroyed, whichever happens first. In Foe Hunters, players don't use cards to buy cards like most deck building games. Each Hero has their own experience pool that they draw upon to purchase cards, and when these cards are purchased they go directly to hand instead of to your discard pile. This allows you to get answers for problems when you need them.&#10;&#10;The deck building element in Foe Hunters revolves around the City Deck. This deck has several cards that are available for purchase. Many of these cards have a class affinity, which allows the Hero that matches the class to purchase the card for a discount.&#10;&#10;Foe Hunters is a new take on co-op that mixes a lightweight system with the complexity of an in-depth deck building game or card game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Skittykitts is a card game that uses a unique deck of 21 cards. &#10;A Skittykitt is an enlightened space raccoon.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;     Each character chooses a unique character:&#10;         The Princess - Always goes first; takes an extra turn after the Skittykitts round is played before the game ends.&#10;         The Wizard - Can add or subtract 5 points from his final score; once per game he can fire a &quot;Magic Missle&quot; to knock 1 card from any player's hand and into the boneyard instead of playing a card.&#10;         The Bat - Starts with an extra card; takes 2 cards per turn; takes turn after The Wizard but before the Fool.&#10;         The Fool - Always goes last and only starts with 1 card; always draws 2 cards at the end of his turn.&#10;    &#10;     Each turn players can play ONE card (although The Bat has the superpower to play TWO, each character has special traits). You can also play as many cards as you want per turn if you control the card called Super Speed. Cards are played into different areas:&#10;         The Boneyard - This is a discard pile of sorts. &#10;         The Abyss - The 3 most powerful cards go here when played, they are essentially removed from the game.&#10;         The Zones - Each player has a zone, this is where you put stuff like Super Speed to enhance your powers and abilities, you can also use zone cards to hinder your opponents.&#10;    &#10;     Every card has two sides. One side has the action/event and the other side can be played for points.  Most cards are worth 4 points, although there are also the 0 point cards, and the 10 point cards.  EVERY card was designed to be OVERLY powerful, which then re-balanced into them all being even, but still every turn a massive shift can happen.&#10;     The object of the game is to get the most points, but in Skittykitts even this can change. If the game ends with Reverse Gravity played in any zone lowest points win. And there are the dreaded 0 cards that can eliminate players entirely if they don't take care of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;     21 card deck&#10;     4 special character cards&#10;     Detailed instruction manual&#10;     A pouch for portability&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A traditional Hawaiian game.&#10;&#10;From Katie Harris's review:&#10;&#10;The gameboard is made up of rows and columns, like a checkerboard. However, you can have as many rows and columns as you would like (and your board accommodates). To set-up the game, fill each square with a playing piece, alternating between black and white pieces.&#10;&#10;Black moves first, by taking off one of his pieces. He may only remove a piece from the middle of the board or from one of the corners. White removes one of his pieces that is adjacent orthogonally to the empty square created by Black. There should now be two empty squares next to each other.&#10;&#10;From there on, players take turns jumping their opponents&rsquo; pieces. A jump may only be made orthogonally, never diagonally. A player may make multiple jumps with the same piece in a turn, provided that he does not change direction. Making a multiple jump is optional. Pieces that are jumped are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;When one player is unable to jump during his turn, his opponent wins the game.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.iggamecenter.com/  - igGameCenter (real-time, bot)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Most cards have a number on them from 2-11, which corresponds to each position on the soccer pitch - for example, 9 is a center forward.&#10;&#10;You have to place the cards you get to make attacks on your opponents goal.  3 cards are needed to make up a defensive or attacking formation.  Goalkeeper cards and free kick cards can help to upset the balance of your opponent's plays.&#10;&#10;The possible formations are set out on player aid cards - for instance:&#10;4,2,3 or 5,2,3 make saving(defensive moves)&#10;&#10;and 5,7,9 or 6,10,11 make attacking moves.&#10;&#10;The game is played over two halves and the player with the most goals wins.&#10;&#10;There are separate rules for play with 3 or 4 players.&#10;&#10;All the English teams in the First Edition set were in the First or Second Divisions at the end of the 1958/59 season, and never after that (Grimsby and Barnsley being relegated from the Second Division in that year).&#10;&#10;&#10;",
