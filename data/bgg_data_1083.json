Players are dealt an equal number of the 86 cards showing multiplication problems. Like in war, each player then turns over a card. They must then solve the multiplication problem displayed on the card. The player with the highest answer wins and takes all the cards. If a player's answer is wrong, he or she gives her card to the player to the right. A wild card automatically gains all the cards in that round for the player who plays it. Like in wars, equal answers result in a &quot;war&quot; where players play two face-down cards and the an face-up card, and the winner wins all the cards. Players play a predetermined number of times through the deck or until one player has all the cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game consists of 5 little games which can be played as a tournament one after each other, where the player with the most points wins or each game as a single game.&#10;&#10;Didi Hallervorder is a famous German comedian, actor in funny films and moderator e.g. from &quot;Hidden Camera&quot;. This game is a party game. Didi is known to participate for each joke and this is the reason written in the rules why his name is in the title and his image is in all games.&#10;&#10;The games:&#10;1. Pinch the Didi (Zwick' den Didi). A spinning circle is in the middle and a path for a kind of race. The players pinch their little clothes peg at the edge of the spinning circle.&#10;At all positions there is an action e.g. move 3 fields, suspend 2 turns.&#10;These actions are executed, normally moving forward your figure on the path.&#10;After the round 1 or more players reach the finish line this game ends. The points each player gets are written on the path.&#10;&#10;2. Didi listen (Didi horch einmal):&#10;5 little balls: 4 empty and 1 with stones in it.&#10;1 4 part puzzle showing Didis face for each player. &#10;The active player takes all the balls in his hands and tries to hear which is the stone filled. Each player who is right gets 1 piece of his 4 piece puzzle. Who has finished first gets 5 points all others 1 point for each piece.&#10;&#10;3. Didi eats chinese (Didi i&szlig;t chinesisch):&#10;Feet a Didi figure with your chips using chopsticks like in China. Game ends when 1 player has feet all his chips. He gets 1 bonus point. Each player gets 1 point for each of his chips Didi has eaten.&#10;&#10;4. Jiggle Didi (Wackel-Didi)&#10;There is a jiggling figure of Didi in the middle of the table. Each player tries to get rid of his chips by placing them on the hat of the Didi figure. If chips fall down, the player gets them.

    "Description": "Landpower: GAAT (the Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey scenario) is a wargame designed by LTC Patrick Schoof at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College and used for instruction in academic year 2018.&#10;&#10;Landpower is designed to drive both sides to plan and conduct sequential operations in a large scale combat environment. Many parts of shaping and combat are intentionally abstracted to allow the intended training audience to focus on appropriate decisions at the division echelon as a division commander and staff. The mechanics of the game are intentionally minimized above and below the echelon of decision. A well-planned operation with its events synchronized usually works most of the time. A poorly planned large scale operation will likely result in failure. Friction is intentionally built in! Landpower was designed to meet educational learning objectives while still being able to stand alone as a wargame. Because of this, most of the instructions ask the reader to treat the conduct of it as an exercise. In the classroom, Landpower is not about the game, but rather the discussion the wargame elicits.&#10;&#10;The exercise is conducted over a series of days. Each day is broken down into four, six-hour turns. During the turns each side will have opportunities to conduct operations to achieve their side&rsquo;s objectives.&#10;&#10;The scenario in Landpower is conducted mostly in Azerbaijan based on the GAAT (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey) terrain. Each hex is roughly 6.5km across. The terrain has been abstracted for the division echelon of decision with consideration given to possible second order effects of a particular feature&rsquo;s inclusion or exclusion from the exercise. For example, the terrain at 39&deg;56'42.3&quot;N 48&deg;21'00.4&quot;E was treated as urban, and the northwest-southeast road was omitted because it would not change operations, though the bridge was retained.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players undertake certain actions to build a railtrack from space S to space Z, while connecting 4 cities in between. The Players draw Action cards. If a player completes an action keeps the card. The game ends when all action cards have been played. The player with the most action cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;Additionally to laying tracks (round yellow tokens), the players have to develop the 4 cities by building houses, delivering resources and building bridges over the river.&#10;&#10;The materials are transported with one cube, that functions as a helicopter (H), a truck (L) or a ship (S), depending which symbol shows on top. All players use the same cube. If a player can't complete his action in one turn, the next player may use his collected materials as he takes control of the cube. The transport capacity of the cube and it's ability to move over the terrain depends on which vehicle the cube represents at the time. Movement of the cube is like a queen at Chess. Each player has 3 movements per turn. Before each movement the player may change direction and/or the mode of transport.&#10;&#10;The tracks are stored at the factory at the middle of the game board. The resources (blue square tokens) are placed on the 3 terrain markers with the neutral side up. They have to be transported to the factory, where they get stored their symbol side up (house, resources, bridge). From three they have to be transported to the 4 cities according to the actions appointed by the action cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tempus is a retro style card game that's fun for everyone! Inspired by the greats, like UNO, Skip-bo, Phase 10, and Rack-O.&#10;&#10;Players control time to play all of their cards before their opponents!&#10;&#10;Components: 1 travel case/game board, 1 instruction sheet, 168 cards, consisting of 12 each #1-#12 (clock cards), 18 n (wild) cards, and 6 Reverse time cards.&#10;&#10;Reverse time cards: These cards dictate the counting order of the game. The first time they are played, they are played face up to change the direction to counterclockwise (backward) counting direction. The second time they are played face down to indicate clockwise direction. They are played to the side of the time zones, separate from the counting piles.&#10;&#10;Objective: Play all of the cards in your countdown deck before your opponent! The game ends when a player has accumulated 365 points, and then the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&#10;     Deal 12 cards face down to each player, each player flips their top card over and places it on top of their cards to create the countdown pile.&#10;     Reveal 4 cards face up in the 4 time zones in the center. If any n (wild) cards are revealed, cover them up with another card until 4 clock cards.&#10;     If any reverse time cards are revealed, they are played to the side of the time zones.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play: The player to the left of the dealer draws cards until they have 5 in their hand. They may use cards from their countdown pile, hand, or discards to count the hours of the clock in the time zone, according to the direction (forwards or backwards) in the directional area.&#10;&#10;Counting in Tempus is cyclical, like a clock. Players will count 11-12-1 in forwards direction, and 1-12-11 in backwards direction.&#10;&#10;If a player can play all 5 cards from their hand in a single turn, they can draw 5 more cards and continue playing&#10;&#10;All n cards must be covered by the next clock card in the sequence before that players turn is over. If it cannot be covered, it is removed from the time zone and placed at the bottom of their countdown deck.&#10;&#10;A player MUST count at least one card in the Time Zone from their countdown pile, hand, or discard per turn. They must draw cards into their hands until they can. If a player has more than 5 cards after discarding, they must place the excess cards at the bottom of their countdown pile.&#10;&#10;A player ends their turn by discarding 1 card into one of their four discard piles. Cards may be stacked, but only the current top card of each discard pile is playable. Any remaining cards in a players hand carries over to their next turn, where they will draw until they have 5 again.&#10;&#10;Play continues to the left until one player has used all of the cards in their countdown pile. All other players add up their cards remaining in their countdown piles and add it to their score. (1-4: 5 pts, 5-8: 10 pts, 9-12: 15 pts, n: 20, RT: 25)&#10;&#10;Once a player has reached 365 points, the game is over, and the player with the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players draw and roll six dice a turn from their bag, meaning that controlling bag composition is key to victory.&#10;&#10;Quarriors! is a fast-paced game in which players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do you use your Quiddity to summon creatures in the hopes of scoring glory, or should you spend it all to capture more powerful quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponents through strategic spell use, the acquisition of powerful quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opposing creatures in combat. If your creatures survive until your next turn, you will score glory points and move closer to victory!&#10;&#10;Quarriors!

These are victory points points you get when the game is over. However if you play them you wont get victory point total&#10;&#10;Another use of spies is to capture territory on the world map. If an area is undefended (Meaning there is no spy there) it only requires you to put one spy there. If there was 1 defending spy there you would have too expend 2 spies to capture it, if 2 are defending you would need 3 spies to capture, and so forth.&#10;&#10;When controlling an area that area gives you certain perks. For example as long as you control north america you gain one extra worker. However once you lose influence over that area you lose the extra spy.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game you will look and see who has influence over the seven continents.

    "Description": "This turn of the century German game stands out for its magnificent artwork and very unusual board. The box cover shows a pre-dreadnought battleship slicing through the sea, from off its starboard bow, while the board initially unfolds to show a side-on view of the ship with no apparent game features.&#10;&#10;However, the board image then unfolds further from the ship's main deckline to reveal a schematic of the ship's compartments, a 46-space roll-and-move track from a bunkroom in the bow to the engine room. The artwork in the gameboard portion is highly detailed, with images of furniture, seamen at work and varied ship's stores, but in a plain red ink against a white background.&#10;&#10;There are six playing pieces, highly detailed human figures in different uniforms and dress, printed on cardboard and standing in coloured wooden disks.&#10;&#10;Both the cover illustration and the board take considerable artistic liberties with technical details. The ship on the cover looks very much like the 1898-commissioned pre-dreadnought battleship Kaiser Wilhelm III, but has an extra funnel and is missing a side turret. The ship on the board has the correct two funnels, but is missing the barbette gun beside the main forward turret as well as one of the three side turrets, and has no rear turret. The ships fly non-existent and therefore neutral flags of horizontal stripes, but are red-yellow-blue on the cover and red-blue-yellow on the board.&#10;&#10;The cover art is signed with the initials SR, while the board art is unsigned, which may explain the differences in detail. The lack of any publisher information is unusual for a German game of such high quality.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "RPGQuest Dungeons is a RPG (Role Playing Game) and Modern Board game that takes place inside Stone Labyrinths, dungeons and secret passages called &quot;Dungeons&quot; or &quot;Seth's Tunnels&quot; in the Kingdom of Arcadia.&#10;Legends say that the ancient Egyptian god of death built these living labyrinths in the Underworld and that these labyrinths could change and change their position over time, making the task of mapping them impossible.&#10;Portals and passages sometimes pop up in the Arcadia Mountain Chains, often accompanied by reports of attacks by monsters and other creatures in nearby villages. Seth's Tunnels serve as shelters for Orcs, Goblins, Cultists, Necromancers, the Living Dead and the terrible Svartalfenheim (The Black Elves), as well as the Scorpion People and other even more terrifying creatures.&#10;Dungeons can be ancient abandoned mausoleums, ancient crypts of lost dynasties, subterranean labyrinths built by already extinct races, dens or orches and caches of orcs, gnolls or goblins, serving as the basis for powerful necromantics or even demonic portals for other dimensions. All of these sites have legends about lost treasures and valuable artifacts and attract the attention of Kingdom Adventurers groups.&#10;Our game begins when a group of Four Brave Heroes decides to investigate these locations in their quest during Hero's Journey.&#10;The RPGQuest can be played from 2 to 5 people (or up to 6 people if one of them takes the role of Narrator). Each of them will take on the role of one or more Heroes (out of 12 initials) within a team of 4 Adventurers and together they must face the challenges within the Dungeons.&#10;&#10;RPGQuest is played in stages, called ADVENTURES. During an Adventure, a Hero can find or gain treasures and valuable artifacts. Weapons, Armor, and Magic Items that can be used in the following Adventures of a Campaign. You can also improve the powers and attributes of your Characters by making them stronger and more powerful on your Journey.&#10;Heroes must act together to win the Adventures. RPGQuest is a Cooperative game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All you have to do is make one movie a year, simple right?  By the end of the contract, only the director with the most of the prestigious Oskie awards will get an extension, so watch out for your competition.&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s a Wrap is played over four rounds, each one represented the cycle of a movie&rsquo;s production.  As directors, the players build the movie from scratch, first choosing a genre after seeing the list of actors and scripts available for purchase.  Each genre, actor, and script have different values that reflect their ability to make money and win awards, with some cards being more specialized in either field.  After players choose their genres, they purchase scripts and hire actors via bidding.  Before any movies can be released, they have to go through a bit of studio meddling; each player plays a card that may help their movie or hinder others&rsquo;.  If a certain movie is a passion project, a player may elect to keep their film from being meddled with once per game.  After movies are shot and finished, they go to market, where each movie makes some amount of profit.  However, the season isn&rsquo;t over until the Oskies are awarded.  The highest box office film takes home the Audience Choice award, and the more artistically inclined ones can vie for three different awards, including for screenplay, performance, and director.  Each director will go through this cycle four times, making a different film each time, and progressively getting access to more impressive genres, higher quality scripts, and A-List actors.  At the end of the game, the director with the most Oskies wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player choses three cards that they will have access to each turn; at the start of each turn they also draw four random ones so that they have a hand of seven. Accordingly, what an army can do will be strongly influenced by the initial plan as indicated by the chosen cards: if you chose a &quot;attack on left&quot; card, you'll always be able to do so, if not any such ambitions are at the mercy of card draw.&#10;&#10;Combat resolution is more traditional: a unit in combat rolls one die per stand it consists of, needing a certain number to hit depending depending on weapons. Hits cause disorder unless negated by resolve saves, and a unit that takes more disorder than it has stands routs off the battlefield.&#10;&#10;",

Move next to the disease to eliminate it, but with another physician close by to protect you. If you are not prepared to sacrifice some of the physicians lives, you cannot eliminate much of the disease. If the physician jumps over a disease, it is eliminated from the board and the game. Physicians may continue jumping as long as&#10;they can eliminate disease.&#10;&#10;The Angel of Death places more disease at the end of each physician player&rsquo;s turn. A physician, surrounded by diseases, four in the middle of the board, two on the side of the board, or one in a corner, is killed and removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The game is over when either:&#10;&#10;&bull; When there is no disease left to place.&#10;&bull; All the physicians have been killed.&#10;&bull; There is no disease on the board.&#10;&#10;Total the numbers on the physicians, that is their score.

    "Description": "Tybor the Builder: At the King's Behest consists of twenty-four new cards (four of them are rule / deck cards) comprising three modules that can be added to the Tybor the Builder base game, individually or in any combination. The three modules are:&#10;&#10;1) Royal Decrees&#10;&#10;This module offers ten cards which show a royal decree. These decrees can be fulfilled in a similar manner as the Public Objectives from the base game. The difference is that the decrees are fulfilled in game and can only be fulfilled by one player.&#10;&#10;2) The Councilmen&#10;&#10;This module adds a new kind of character who is offering a new symbol and bonus accordingly. If a Councilman becomes a citizen of your tableau, each Legal Text symbol is worth 1 point for every set of discounts of all four colors.&#10;&#10;3) The Mystery&#10;&#10;This module adds four new buildings to the game. These buildings not only offer the usual victory points, but also serve as one symbol of your choice for game end scoring.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Due to the stalemate at Brunete the Republicans launched a new offensive further east in Aragon Province. The new offensive would again be spearheaded by the International Brigades by the Army of the East. The goal was to break through the Nationalist lines and take the key city of Zaragosa. Success here would compel the Nationalists to withdraw, bringing relief to the city of Madrid and demonstrating the Republican cause could still win the civil war. The Nationalists had stripped this portion of the front of troops, with only three divisions holding the line. Despite their superiority in men and tanks, as well as the commitment of nearly all of the Republican air force to the offensive, the Nationalists grimly held to their positions and were able to disrupt the Republican attack. The fighting was particularly hard at Belchite, where fighting degenerated into a house-to-house slugfest that left the city in ruins. By the start of September the Nationalists had brought up reinforcements and gained air superiority.

The card set replaces the standard deck of playing cards called for in the rules, features graphics by Ilya Kudriashov, and has rules reminders on pertinent cards.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The Pirate Syndicate is a business-driven corporation that vies to gain as much power by exploiting the &quot;honest&quot; merchants. Their Queen Pirate loves to use the fastest vessel in all of Materia, The Dreadnought, to dominate the sea of clouds. The Great British Empire is a monarch regime that controls most of the known city-islands. The king's hand, the Governor of the seven seas, is the most dominant person who loves to enforce his laws by lashing out his fearsome Flying Fortress after contraband dealing pirates.&#10;&#10;In Steam Pirates, each player builds their own trading network of piracy by dealing in four types of goods: coal, rum, firearms, and automatons. Your goal is to capitalize the &quot;open&quot; market by selling your goods while maneuvering your frigate to explore new markets and new resourceful allies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each elemental path gives you the power to stop your opponent or it can help to follow the right path to the Ancient Dragon.&#10;&#10;The legend has it that the Ancient Dragon reveals himself only to those who complete the Dragon's Path, rewarding them with power and wisdom. Many wizards attempted, only a few of them succeeded.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect five different path cards or four cards of the same element in your play area. Each of the five different path cards has two powerful effects. On their turn players:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Draw a card. &#10;&bull;    Play a card declaring which effect to use. &#10;&bull;    Wait for the opponent to play a card in response (some effects allow you to play cards during opponent&rsquo;s turn).&#10;&bull;    Eventually apply the effect and collect the card.&#10;&#10;In the Advanced Mode you can use unique powerful spell to twist the game! Before starting the game, players take two spell cards. Each spell card can be played by discarding two specific path cards.

Players construct a racing machine from components found in the junk pile and battle down the track to the finish line.&#10;&#10;There are four components every racer needs to race: chassis, wheels, steering, and propulsion. There are over 250 racer combinations, so players may customize a racer that fits their style. Each component has its own attributes; some are quick and flimsy, others slow and sturdy. Junk cards may be combined to build contraptions and upgrades. Contraptions are single-use items that affect may damage another racer, speed up a racer, or repair racers quickly. Upgrades are permanent add-ons to a racer which improve its stats.&#10;&#10;Once built, the cart moves along the track according to its speed rating. There are five hazard spaces on the board. When players hit a hazard, they interact with it by rolling dice and adding the relevant modifier from their custom racer. Hazards can slow down a racer, stop it temporarily, or damage it.&#10;&#10;Each damage dealt to a racer is represented by a token which covers a beneficial stat on the racer. While covered by a damage token, that stat isn't added to the racer. As long as you have a positive net speed, players may move with damage on their carts. Players may repair damage by skipping a move step and removing two damage tokens, then continuing to race on the next round. The first player to pass the finish line wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The French &amp; More! is the first expansion for the Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution  game. The kit adds ten new battles, adding the French army to the mix and expanding your existing forces.  Of course, the two major land battles involving the French Army are included in the scenarios: Savannah and Yorktown. The expansion also takes a detailed look at the Battle of Brandywine, along with the battles of Springfield, Kings Mountain and Pell&rsquo;s Point.  New terrain tiles, additional blocks, stickers and larger, molded dice, are all included so you can play these new American Revolution War engagements.&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the box:&#10;&#10;3    Terrain and Accessories punchboards containing (these are the thick tiles that have been so well received by players), totaling 45 Double-sided Terrain Tiles and 18 Double-sided Victory Banner counters&#10;8    Battle Dice &ndash; Bigger and now molded dice&hellip;!&#10;3    Block Label sheets&#10;4    Summary Cards&#10;2    Unit Reference Charts&#10;2    Terrain Effects Charts&#10;1    Rule and Scenario Booklet&#10;Over 100 wooden blocks&#10;&#10;You must own a copy of Commands &amp; Colors: Tricorne base game to use this Expansion Kit.&#10;&#10;By design, Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution is not overly complex. The game is based on the highly successful Commands &amp; Colors game system, where the Command cards drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; and the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution, however, introduces many new game concepts, which will add historical depth and provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors player many new play experiences and challenges.&#10;&#10;The scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger American Revolution battles, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. In some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent an entire brigade, while in others a unit may only represent a few companies of soldiers. Still the linear tactics of the period, that you will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various American Revolution Armies of the day, and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought. To further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the British and Continental forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards.&#10;&#10;Players, that are familiar with other Commands &amp; Colors games, will soon note that unit combat losses in a Tricorne game are typically not as great as other games covered in the Commands &amp; Colors series. This is a direct result of the linear tactic fighting style of the armies that fought during the American Revolution. Unit morale is the main thematic focus in a Tricorne battle as it was historically. Knowing that an entire unit, that has only taken minimal losses when forced to retreat, may actually break and rout from the battlefield, will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Due to the rising tide of witchcraft that is threatening to overtake the burgeoning town of New Salem, the founders have elected a Constable to help mediate the situation. Because it is feared witches may have infiltrated the founding group, the Constable will rotate among them to avoid any witch getting too much power.&#10;&#10;The 2nd Edition includes The Constable expansion. The Constable will be in charge of triggering the plentiful array of new events that have become available, such as Seance, Purge, and Hysteria. There will be a random assortment of 7 events (from a pool of 25+ events) in each game to create a different witch hunt each time.&#10;&#10;The Gloom and Law buildings have been replaced with new sets that add or remove Despair with each building, but have an end game effect of adding or removing a lot more if you collect the set of 3.&#10;&#10;",
