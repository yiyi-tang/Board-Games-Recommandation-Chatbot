Players are guests who have been invited by the owner of a grand manor on a snowy winter night. While the guests have never met each other before this night, they share one thing in common: they all have their own reasons for hating the owner of the manor and have designs on his death. When the owner turns up dead, everyone realizes that a formal police investigation might end of leading back to their own person&hellip;so they decide to resolve it among themselves by collecting evidence to find the murderer concealed amidst their numbers.&#10;&#10;If the players can expose the true identity of the murderer and reveal the tricks and weapon he or she used within the time constraints, they win. Oppositely, if the guilty party is able to deceive everyone and go undetected, that person wins the game.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can chose to either investigate, accuse, or make a final accusation.

Aspects of the components/box have also been improved based on feedback from the previous game.&#10;&#10;",

In the past two thousand years, 158 bloody battles have been recorded in history.&#10;&#10;In November 1948, a decisive battle of unprecedented scale was about to break out. The number of troops participating in the war exceeded that at any time in the past. The total number of troops invested by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached 1.4 million. Compared with other wars in history, it is really not worth it.&#10;&#10;With regard to this decisive battle, the strategic objectives of the two sides are different, and they also have two different names. The Kuomintang's expectation of the campaign was that the whole army would guarantee the lifeline of the railway from Xuzhou to Bengbu on the Jinpu line, so it was named &quot;Xubeng battle&quot;. Su Yu's plan is to attack Haizhou first and then win the two criteria. Therefore, our side is called &quot;Huaihai Campaign&quot;.&#10;&#10;In this decisive battle to determine the fate of a country and a nation, the Kuomintang army invested more than 800000 people and the people's Liberation Army invested 600000 people. In the end, 600 thousand destroyed the 800 thousand. Over the years, the war history textbooks of military academies in various countries have called this campaign a &quot;classic war example&quot; and studied it as a major topic. Generation after generation of professional soldiers of different nationalities, different skin colors and different political beliefs are no strangers to this war case. What makes people deeply interested is its process. How did the 600000 people with inferior military strength and equipment defeat the 800000 people with superior military strength and equipment.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the distant future, humanity mastered the science of creating antimatter and this enabled a huge leap in prosperity and evolution for the race. Now, in possession of powerful engines powered by this new and virtually inexhaustible fuel, Earth factions seek to claim new homes for themselves in the depths of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Antimateria is a civ/euro game, with a scifi theme and medium interaction in which conflicts occur indirectly between players - disputes over actions, locations and resources.&#10;&#10;In Antimateria, each player represents a faction of a future humanity, which has been given a mission to explore the universe to discover new habitable planets. Everyone cooperates for the good of the humanity, but the game is competitive. Resources are public, meaning if you produce, any player can use the resources at the table. The objective is to gain points with the Federation government being the faction with the best performance in 4 categories (technologies, production, colonization and influence).&#10;&#10;The mechanic is card driven where players, instead of playing an action for themselves, play an action that can be done by everyone, at the cost of placing their emissaries on the card. Players reveal the cards simultaneously, so each turn the player chooses which one he wants to activate. If the card the player played is activated by another player, he earns Solaris credits. Credits can be used in a variety of ways, from buying resources to activating certain actions. At the end of the game they serve as a wild resource for scoring if not used. Solaris is a management game with a lot of planning.&#10;&#10;Colonies are represented by dice and the die value indicates the level of development of the colony. The more developed it is, the more it will generate credits and also colonization points. Tech cards give you unique abilities and also tech points, while building buildings allows you to earn production points and, of course, generate resources. Finally, there are public goals that when achieved allow the player to gain more emissaries to use and give points of influence. At the end of the game, your score is the sum of your 2 lowest tracks, which forces players to invest in all tracks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "La Guerre &agrave; Outrance is a traditional miniatures game for recreating the larger actions of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Players maneuver brigades -- whole armies can be fielded to re-play entire battles over the course of a normal gaming session. It is designed to be a fast-play alternative to other grand-tactical systems, and uses a common basing system for figures. Time, figure, and ground scales are higher, making for shorter, more decisive actions.&#10;&#10;The emphasis is on army and corps-level command: the functions of lower-level generals and officers are handled by the system. This speeds play, and lets players focus on commanding armies instead of regiments or brigades. The game does not use dice, and allows one or more players to use a device to moderate play. The interface is simple and easy to use.&#10;&#10;The system is built on a large body of research into the weapons, formations, and doctrine of the period, hiding this complexity to let players experience a more detailed level of simulation in a fast-play format. So go ahead and discover what it is like to fight war to the uttermost, in the most decisive European conflict of the later 19th century!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.&#10;&#10;To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.&#10;&#10;Jungle Speed Electronique keeps the familiar game play elements from Jungle Speed: Players reveal cards from their individual stacks one at a time, and whenever two players have identical cards face-up in front of themselves, they race to grab the totem first. Whoever does so gives his cards to the slowpoke. The first player to rid himself of cards wins.&#10;&#10;What's new in the electronic version of this game is the totem will give you directions from time to time that change the nature of game play &ndash; some of which might lead you into doing the wrong thing! Jungle Speed Electronique includes three levels of game play with a dozen special actions programmed into the totem.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Suursaari, also known as H&ouml;gland, Gogland, or &lsquo;the Great Island&rsquo;, is a large island in the Gulf of Finland. In 1942 and again in 1944 it was the focal point of a battle. The island is centrally located, perfect for dominating sea lanes leading to Leningrad or those crossing between Finland and Estonia. Float planes, or ski planes in winter, could use it as a base; strings of minefields could be monitored from it; coastal guns placed on it could engage passing ships. Immediately before World War II the island belonged to the Finns. It was a rustic vacation destination, complete with casino. The Russians acquired the island without a fight during the Winter War of 1939/40. In the winter of 1942, the Finns took it back from the Russians. In September 1944 the Germans tried and failed to take it from the Finns. This game comprises two scenarios covering these battles, using a common set of rules.&#10;&#10;Scale is 300 meters across a given hex. Contour lines are 20 meter intervals. Since the 1942 battle took place in winter and the 1944 battle took place in summer, each scenario uses its own map. The military units are sections (squads), platoons, and companies. Other counters represent batteries of artillery and mortars, naval craft, individual commanders, and bunkers. Each player&rsquo;s military forces must manoeuvre across the game board, attacking the opposing force with direct and indirect fire, airstrikes, naval gunnery, and fighting hand-to-hand. One player is the Defender and the other is the Attacker. The Attacker must achieve his objectives before time runs out. The longer the game goes on, the more objectives he must achieve to win. Turns are one hour. Special rules include snow storms, the Finns attacking across the ice in winter, German naval landings using barges and assault boats, naval gunfire by flak barges and a destroyer squadron, airstrikes, variable visibility due to terrain, weather, and time of day, antitank guns that can fire HE in an indirect role, and much more.&#10;&#10;In the 1942 scenario, the Finns attack across the ice in a blinding snowstorm against a reinforced Soviet battalion of half-frozen men, some of whom nevertheless resisted for 3 days. In the 1944 scenario the Germans fail in their attempt to bluff the Finns into handing over the island peacefully, land a motley force including worn-out infantry, coastal artillery personnel, 88mm flak guns with no ammunition, and 580 men of Marine-Artillerie-Abteilug 531. The 531st was no sedentary coastal garrison, but a special commando unit whose men took part in the very first battle of the war, the assault on the Westerplatte at Danzig on 1 September 1939. The Finns defeat them all, just in time to hand the island over to the Soviets as part of the Armistice agreement.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Army of the Rhine is the fourteenth volume in Red Sash Games&rsquo; Lace Wars series. This game is the last in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years' War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV.&#10;&#10;As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France&rsquo;s borders. That was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King&rsquo;s ultimate aim, that was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis&rsquo; war of middle age &ndash; a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men. There was not even supposed to be a war, only a demonstration of France&rsquo;s power. France was engaged in a long process of securing her eastern and northeastern frontiers. Louis felt his prestige was on the line when some of his German neighbours &ndash; specifically the Elector Palatine and the good burghers of Cologne &ndash;&nbsp;refused to give him what he wanted. A strong message needed to be sent. Also, by taking military action the French would put heart into the Turks, who were fighting a losing battle against the forces of the Holy League; keeping the Ottoman Empire in the game would ensure the Holy Roman Emperor could not support the minor powers who were the real object of King Louis&rsquo; wrath. But, things did not go as planned. &#10;  &#10;In Army of the Rhine, you will have a chance to change history &ndash; and perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books. As the Allied commander you lead a motley collection of troops. They are nearly all German, but that means very little. In the Empire, a prince only contributes greatly to the Cause if he expects to be greatly rewarded; otherwise, he will contribute as little as he thinks he can get away with. And, because the princes have the option to aid either Emperor Leopold or King William of England, they can play the one off against the other without being accused of letting the side down. Vienna may tell you to expect 30,000 men from Brandenburg, only to learn their Elector has chosen to fight in Brabant this year, because King William paid him in advance. And as for expecting help from the Emperor himself, forget it. French passivity in the face of your outstanding defense of the frontier last year has given him the excuse to siphon away yet more resources to his never-ending Hungarian war.&#10;&#10;",

The game ends when one player gets all the Candombe letters, and the players with less errors win.&#10;&#10;Promotes communication, attention and coordination are put into play in A Clave de Candombe.&#10;&#10;&#10;A KEY TO CANDOMBE&#10;&#10;On Sundays, in the R&iacute;o de la Plata, slaves were allowed to rest and meet their relatives and friends, they &ldquo;called&rdquo; from one patio to another through the powerful sound of the drums. Thus they were in music, song and dance, to enjoy the meeting. In the rhythmic base of this musical species, the whole game is developed, that is to say that during a game everyone must repeat this sequence to accompany the game.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: Create a sequence of calls and audible responses (with onomatopoeia) without losing the rhythm that all the players do (key of candombe).&#10;&#10;A card is dealt to each player in full view of all, which will have a gesture with a sound that will represent it. Once everyone has gotten into the rhythm of candombe, the game begins.&#10;&#10;The rhythm must never stop!&#10;&#10;",

Players battle to have the most influence points over several rounds of gameplay by maintaining the strongest loyalties to the four warring Houses in the North.&#10;&#10;In Old North, you have no armies of your own. Instead, you maintain a court (or open hand) of five nobles belonging to the four Houses to manipulate and use their armies for your benefit.&#10;&#10;Gameplay revolves around a central board containing six important regions in the realm. Occupying these regions are the armies of the four Houses, vying for control of each one. Over the course of the game, players score points for each noble in their court based on it's House's presence and control of the six regions. Controlling nobles in your court that belong to the most dominant Houses on the board will score you the most points - but comes at a cost.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you will play a noble from your hand and perform one of over 30 unique actions and events. Playing a noble improves its House&rsquo;s numbers and advantage on the board, but in turn removes its presence from your court &ndash; eliminating its ability to score points. On one hand, maintaining a court of nobles belonging to the most powerful Houses is the key to victory &ndash; but that means keeping them tucked away in your court, away from danger and unable to add to their House's strength on the board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The players will put themselves in the shoes of the most iconic Super Villains of Gotham City: The Joker, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, The Penguin, Bane, Poison Ivy, and The Scarecrow. The goal? Escape from an iconic institution of Gotham City: Arkham Asylum.&#10;&#10;Batman: Escape from Arkham Asylum offers the funny and wild vision of the comics of the Batman universe and introduces a novel element: confronting Batman. Players must join forces to achieve their common goal. However, each one of them will have their own hidden objectives, which can range from escaping on their own or sowing as much chaos as possible in the asylum, something they must achieve to gain an advantage over their companions and be the one who finally wins the victory.&#10;&#10;The players choose a Super Villain and play their turns one after the other. In each of these turns, the players can perform different actions such as moving around on the board, attacking their enemies with crazy weapons, searching rooms or crafting tools to use in their escape. The game ends when the players escape or when everyone is defeated by the forces of order that run Arkham, from the tough guards of the complex to, of course, the Dark Knight himself.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BirdSeed is a card game from Japan. The game title is actually published as Bird$eed on the box front, and also as 'bird seed' in the game rules.&#10;&#10;Players are roosters, trying to get food to score points. Getting sets of the same food scores best. Each rooster has a pair of favourite foods, and getting up to five of these adds points.&#10;&#10;The food comes in three types, wheat, corn and nuts, in 1,2 or 3, or one of each. Cards showing a left wing, right wing and roosters are laid out, and three food cards dealt face-up to each one. Players then use card hands to win these food cards. Any food not collected stays in place and more food is added.&#10;&#10;The players have hand cards to match the positions, and cards numbered 0,1,2,3 in different amounts. Players play three cards face-down, a place and two numbers to show which food pile they are going for and what number they bid. The numbers are added together and the game follows a butting process like Hols der Geier. But before the cards are assessed, any special combos take effect. So a pair, such as 11, gets you a free food card off the draw deck. A 00 gets you a food card from the player with the most.&#10;&#10;Then players with a unique choice (left, right, centre) get their food. Then players with the same choice compare values. The highest value wins, but matching high values means the next highest wins, and so on.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, most points scored wins.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Build your monster&rsquo;s strength, speed, and scare to compete for the gold medal in the Monster Olympics!&#10;&#10;The game is played over 15 rounds, with players playing simultaneously, trying to earn the most points by earning medals and advancing your monster as far as possible. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, however each player determines how to use the dice.&#10;&#10;In each round, you will roll 2 dice and then use those dice to determine which monster upgrade to use. Each monster upgrade advances certain tracks. At the end of the game, you will compare your Strength, Speed, and Scare to see who had the most in each category. You will also score your track with the lowest number.&#10;&#10;Scoring - Medal Ceremony&#10;&#10;You will compete in three contests consisting of Strength, Speed, and Scare. First, compare your number on the tracks with every other player. The player with the highest number on each track earns the Gold Medal, 7 points, and writes a 7 in the Scoring area under the Strength icon. The player with the next highest score earns the Silver Medal, 3 points. The next highest earns the Bronze Medal, 1 point. It is friendly scoring, so ties are shared.  Then check your individual four tracks, and write the lowest number in the last scoring area. Add your score and the player with the highest score is the Monster Olympics Champion!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tanzania is a card game that will immerse you in the heart of Africa. Carnivorous animals, herbivores, herds and hunters will be the protagonists of a challenge full of threats, strategy and emotion.&#10;&#10;In this game, each participant must avoid all the threats present to make their animals survive in the African savanna.&#10;&#10;&#10;Objective: Be the first player to save 20 animals.&#10;&#10;Contents: 50 animal cards, 35 situation cards, 35 hunter cards, 1 hand token, 1 regulation.&#10;&#10;TANZANIA is a semi-cooperative card game.&#10;&#10;Animal cards are dealt to each player and a situation card is raised (Day in the open field / Sunset at the river / Night in the grasslands).&#10;&#10;Then an animal card is played trying not to lose it. When playing a carnivore you have to hunt. When playing a herbivore you have to avoid being hunted.&#10;Each animal card has a score according to the situation card previously drawn.&#10;&#10;By playing the same card as another participant, a pack is formed, increasing the score of the cards that comprise it.&#10;&#10;Despite having stronger cards and weaker cards, the fact of forming a pack and playing as a team equates the weakest with the strongest.&#10;&#10;At the end of the hand a hunter card is raised. In case one comes out, he hunts the strongest animal on the table, modifying the outcome of the round.&#10;&#10;The strategy of the game is to know when to play each animal, since by playing a weak card you run the risk of being hunted by another animal and by playing a strong card you run the risk of being hunted by a hunter.&#10;&#10;The first player to save 20 animals wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
