The player with the larger pyramid wins, except that an empty hand beats the large pyramid.  The winner picks one of the loser's pyramids to keep, and the loser challenges someone else.  If a player runs out of pyramids they take one from each other player.&#10;&#10;Once someone has all 3 pyramids of one of colors of their goal cards, they reveal it.  The person who first fulfills both goal cards wins.&#10;&#10;This was Looney Labs' 2009 &quot;Holiday Gift&quot;.

If he is, the chase for the (now known) chip starts again (for the other players).

If a cop car can't make a legal move (or doesn't want to), the police players get a token (&quot;Ermahnung&quot;); when they collect 20 tokens they lose.&#10;&#10;",

Each player disc has an offence and a defence rating. There are two rounds called shifts. The player mat has spots for 14 NHL player discs. The mat is broken in two by a centerline and each side of this line has 3 forward 2 defence a goalie and shootout spot where your discs are to be placed face down. Gamers take turns deciding whether they will be on offence or defence.  They then pick a face down disc and the game becomes a game of war where players simultaneously flip over a player discs and compare offence and defence ratings. The higher of the two ratings scores a goal. You go through 6 turns in 2 shifts keeping track of goals (a tie in ratings equals no goal) if after two rounds the score is still tied you go to the shoot-out player and the game is decided by a tie breaker...&#10; Every NHL team is represented and special foil game cards featuring hockey&rsquo;s top stars will are included. A starter box includes random game cards and play-mat, and enough cards for one player to ice a team.

    "Description": "Welcome to the world of Inside the Paint Basketball (ITP) !&#10;&#10;The game is driven by double-sided FACs where players make plays and the defense can make defensive stops on the floor or on shots possibly taking away great plays/shots from the offensive player. The use of FACs keeps the action moving along at a pace simulating the real sport.&#10;&#10;All of the action comes from the players&rsquo; cards with no chart lookups needed. In ITP, each player will have 3 columns per card showing regular offense, offensive rebound and fastbreak sections. In each section the players frequency of 2/3 FGA, drawing fouls, turnovers and assists come into play. For the Dennis Rodman types when the offense does come his way a simple PASS may be the outcome. Each player has separate GOTO ratings where the more they are involved in the offense the better chance you will see him be called upon to make a play. You often see players that don't have great offensive stats (FG%, TO) but these are often guys that have to create offense. If you don't have a any offensive weapons (good or bad) on the floor then you will see the offense bog down in ITP.&#10;&#10;Defense in ITP is not an afterthought and is intertwined into the game at all points. Players are rated separately for steals, blocks, committing fouls and overall defense. A special DENY rating for defensive players works with the aforementioned GOTO ratings where good defenders can actually keep a player from being able to take an action on the court. The defensive ratings come into play in what are called possible defensive stops. There are special notations on the FACs that can possibly stop an offensive action or affect a shot.&#10;&#10;ITP keeps the action moving with a fastbreak system that is simple yet effective to use. The run-and-gun style teams will feel that way as will the plodders. Each player gets a fastbreak rating that shows his propensity to get out on the break and, when he does, his card has a column just for that event.&#10;&#10;The special Momentum Factor (*MOM) is built into the FACs and either gives a team a boost or causes them to miss some shots. The use of timeouts can readjust this factor and keep the game on an even keel but you must use them wisely as timeouts can be very useful towards the end of a game allowing you to call plays and get extra time when you may need it. Managing timeouts can be very challenging. If you use too many timeouts for momentum swings then you will be limited to using your TO's for subs and especially late in a very close game when you want to call a designed play to a specific player. However, not calling timeouts on a momentum run can cause the game to get out of control, thus hurting a teams' chances to win.&#10;&#10;So, if basketball is your game, get out of your seat and get Inside the Paint!&#10;&#10;",

They have different power levels, so some of them are more difficult to beat. Fights are resolved using a die. If you lose the fight, a piece of your armour is removed. Once all of your six armour pieces are removed, you'll lose every fight you get involved in, until you repair your armour.&#10;&#10;Among the enemy knights there are good knights (they're face-down counters too): if you reveal them, they shall give you a Gift (card) to help you in battle.&#10;&#10;You should remember the position of the enemy knights (and/or the good ones) once they are revealed and put face-down again. Each player, at the end of his turn, moves two of the face-down counters around the board. You can move these counters to block the way to other players or even in a square with another player to force him to fight with the enemy knight you just moved! So, if you remember which knights are hidden on the counters you move, you can i.e. move a strong enemy knight towards another player, or a good knight toward you and/or far from other players.&#10;&#10;Armour repair can be done in two ways: finding the counter representing the Gold Kinght of Aries, or passing through the Temple of Aries, located in the center of the top-level board.&#10;&#10;Each of the three pieces of the board can be rotated before being placed, so the whole board can have a few different configurations.&#10;&#10;",

These nominations will be kept hidden until all players are past the eviction stage, at which point ALL will be revealed and the player with the most eviction points will head back to the start (no fun having nobody to play with).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SuperSystem is a fast-paced, skirmish-level superhero miniature battle game designed to simulate comic book clashes between heroes and villains. Playing a game with SuperSystem requires the following: a copy of these rules, painted miniatures, around 20 six-sided dice (D6&rsquo;s), copies of the SuperSheets printed in the appendix of this book, pencils, and a roughly 4&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; playing area.&#10;&#10;SuperSystem is an ideal game for two players, but more participants can get involved for longer, multi-player games. Battles in SuperSystem can involve as few as two models per side, or as many as ten to thirty models per side. There are two basic types of models in SuperSystem: characters and henchmen. Characters are the heroes and villains that make up the superhuman population of Four-Color Earth, the fictional setting of the game. Henchmen are their underlings, goons, mooks, or cannon fodder. Although some henchmen can also possess superhuman powers, they never rise to levels of the characters.&#10;&#10;Players may fight SuperSystem battles as one-off encounters, or as extended campaigns where their heroes and villains develop unique personalities, gain new abilities, and sometimes suffer grievous injuries. These developments occur over a number of game sessions, and are known in SuperSystem as Series.&#10;&#10;This revises SuperSystem 2nd Edition.&#10;&#10;",
