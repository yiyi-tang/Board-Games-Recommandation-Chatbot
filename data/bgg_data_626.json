    "Description": "This is a climbing game with many variations and therefore known by many names (Struggling Upstream, Pits, San Jia Xi, Huojian, Kuoppa). It's related to other climbing games like Dai Hin Min, Tien Len, Big Two and President.&#10;&#10;The game is played with a 54-card pack including two jokers. Each player starts with a hand of cards and the object is to be the first to get rid of all your cards by playing combinations.&#10;&#10;The game consists of playing combinations of cards: single cards, sets, single sequences and multiple sequences. When a player plays a combination, only a combination of the same type, length and higher rank can beat it - to beat a single sequence you must play a single sequence of the same length with higher ranking cards. Jokers are wild cards and can be used in any combinations. The Twos play a special role in this game and can be seen as semi-wild cards.&#10;&#10;The player who gets rid of his cards first gets two points, the second player gets one point. You also get an extra advantage when finishing first or second, because the last and second to last player will have to give their best card away to them in the next hand.&#10;&#10;Zheng Shangyou has a sizable luck element and the winner of a round has an advantage in the next round, but there is room for skillful play as the players learn how to best manage the cards they are dealt. The game plays best with five or six, but can be played by four or more. With 4 or 6 players, the game is usually played with two teams facing off against each other in partnerships.&#10;&#10;",

Lovecraft. This expansion will bring new levels of dread to your table top, with the addition of a brand new Herald Sheet for &quot;The Lurker at the Threshold&quot; &ndash; a powerful and malevolent being that has appeared to prepare the way for the Ancient One, plus more than 200 components and some extraordinary new game mechanics to boot.&#10;&#10;One of the highlights is the full set of 18 Gate markers that are designed to replace those from the Arkham Horror core set, as well as those from The Dunwich Horror and The Kingsport Horror. They are treated exactly the same as the previous Gate markers, except that each Gate now has an additional characteristic. For example, the &quot;Gate of Madness&quot; will cause an investigator to lose one Sanity when they fail to close the Gate, and a &quot;Moving Gate&quot; moves along with monsters during the Mythos phase.&#10; Brand new to The Lurker at the Threshold are Relationship Cards for use in games with two or more players. Each player draws one Relationship Card at the start of the game, which describes some advantage gained due to how the investigator to your left is related to you. Perhaps you are business associates and mutually reap the benefits of income, or both are Students of the Arcane and gain more frequent access to the Spell deck. No matter how you're related, these will bring a more interesting back-story to your game, involving your characters in more ways than ever before.&#10; Finally, The Lurker at the Threshold introduces the Dark Pact deck, which will tempt foolish investigators to enter into a terrible arrangement with the Lurker itself. Although these Dark Pacts may grant your investigator enhanced abilities, there is sure to be a cost. What happens when the price is too high?&#10; Of course, with over 100 new Location cards, Mythos cards, Gate cards and Spells, plus more Common and Unique Items, The Lurker at the Threshold will enhance and expand the enjoyment of Arkham Horror for players of all skill levels.&#10;&#10;-- from the publisher's web site, edited slightly to be up-to-date&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tactical game about three famous battles of Crimean War.&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;1 hex = 200 m (Alma 250 m)&#10;1 game turn = 30 minutes&#10;1 counter = infantry battalion-riffle company/cavalry regiment/artillery battery.&#10;&#10;Game description&#10;&#10;The game uses the standard hex-and-counter system, and ten-sided dice. Each hex represents 200 metres or 218 yards of terrain (Alma 250 metres or 273 yards), each game turn corresponds to 20-30 minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;Infantry is represented by battalions and light infantry companies, cavalry by regiments (sometimes divided into two counters), artillery by batteries (classified by weight).&#10;&#10;Each game turn is divided into phases:&#10;1)Command phase &ndash; players use their Commanders-in-Chief and dispatch riders to give orders to subordinate commanders.&#10;2)Activation phase &ndash; after determining the initiative, players, using the Activation Markers, choose the division to activate. Activated units, move, fire, commence melee combat and reorganise disorganised units. The opponent can react by firing or counterattacking&#10;3)Reorganisation phase &ndash; players reorganise broken units&#10;&#10;The principle of the game is based on an order system, which is associated with target hexes. The player must carry out the assigned order (of course, he gives them to himself), until the order is changed by the Commander-in-Chief, or the division commander manages to change it by himself. The order must be associated with a target hex (i.e attack hex, defend hex). The possible orders are: ATTACK, DEFEND, FORCED MARCH.&#10;&#10;The game tries to present the diversity of combatants tactics mainly through unit formations. And so &ndash; Russian infantry can fight in company or closed columns, French infantry in closed columns or lines and the British infantry only in lines. Each side can form squares, and can use skirmishers. The French Eastern Army excels in light infantry tactics due to it&rsquo;s many formations of such units (chasseurs, zouaves, algerian tiraillieurs).&#10;&#10;The game treats the concept of  zone of control differently from other games &ndash; it gives up the obligation to stop moving the unit in the enemy ZOC. The ZOC is a phenomenon that allows to fire or initiate close combat, and it is dependent on the units formation and the range of its firearms.&#10;&#10;Unit movement doesn&rsquo;t differ from other hex-and-counter systems.&#10;&#10;The game discerns fire combat and melee combat. The fire combat takes into consideration the following aspects:&#10;1)firing unit strength&#10;2)firing unit formation (skirmishers)&#10;3)target formation&#10;4)distance to target&#10;&#10;Fire combat is initiated at the cost of movement points in the unit&rsquo;s activation phase, and once as a reaction for the enemy&rsquo;s doings. Fire combat is based on the unit&rsquo;s morale modifier, which is a combination of unit&rsquo;s morale, training and other &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; factors. Fire combat effects in loss of  endurance, disorganisation and in critical cases, breaking of the attacked unit. Losing movement point is also the effect of fire combat.&#10;&#10;Artillery fire combat is constructed similarly to infantry fire combat &ndash; it only takes into account the differences in range and firepower of guns.&#10;&#10;As a rule, to initiate melee combat, the unit must fight in a compact formation (column, line) or be a cavalry unit. Starting combat requires for a attacking unit to posses sufficient movement points after moving (a marker is placed, on the unit that meets that condition). Melee combat is also based on the unit&rsquo;s morale, strength, formation, also the terrain and attacks from the flank or the unit&rsquo;s rear. Effects of melee combat are disorganisation (also of the attacking unit) or breakdown and taking flight. Cavalry combat also includes the unit&rsquo;s momentum &ndash; which is taken from the type of the unit (heavy, lancers, light cavalry). Cavalry may react by counter-charging.&#10;&#10;The loss of unit&rsquo;s endurance during the game is marked on special tables. The use of tables intents to show precisely the diverse levels of combat losses.&#10;&#10;",

Try to place your own Pods and beware of your opponents feet.&#10;&#10;Pods are tiny animals, living in the darkness of unknown caverns. They are made of a head and some feet  (bipod have 2 feet, tripod: 3 ... octopod:8). A foot may be small: a foot for walking (controls 1 square forward) or big: a foot for running (controls the aligned squares forward).&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns and place their pods in the cavern (a 7x7 grid) but have to deal with the Pods 'way of life': respect your opponent tiny space. So each foot of any pod can never threat a square occupied by an enemy pod. When a player is unable to enter a new pod in the cavern, he loses the game.&#10;&#10;In the advanced rules, the pods may move on the board an threat their enemies ... if a pod has no longer a foot able to walk, he dies and is removed from the board. Players then have to enter their 14 pods into the cavern to win.&#10;&#10;",

The magnets of each team are polarised in reverse, so you cannot affect your opponents players with your rod. The rod is used to drag your players across the board, thus allowing you to push the puck around.&#10;&#10;The game board is a smooth hardboard surface, marked out with an ice hockey pitch, and a basic raised surround to stop the puck going out of play.&#10;&#10;Good fun - lots frantic action!&#10;&#10;",

As it that can do more can do less, the rules can be used for a melting pot of the above or any of them specifically, so the Golgo Island rules can be used for anything from the ever popular zombie games to treasure hunting among many other things.&#10;&#10;Golgo Island offers fast and intuitive play, alternate unit activation,&#10;game balance guided by a point system, and completely adaptable scenarios and game conditions that require neither an umpire, a game master, or even charts to look up all you need is a copy of these rules, a handful of miniatures, some six-sided dice (D6&rsquo;s), a tape measure and a roughly 3&rsquo; x 3&rsquo; playing area. Thanks to simple yet dynamic game mechanics, heroes and henchmen face player and non-player opponents as  well as (more or less) random events in non-stop action and pass-me-the-pop-corn atmosphere. The amount of details and non-player intervention can be tailored out depending on your scenario&rsquo;s requirements and the number of players involved, so while the game is best played with up to 4 players you can easily enjoy it with many more of them on board!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     The compiled WarEngine and Golgo Island' rules.&#10;     Background on Golgo Island and its denizens.&#10;     Profiles for over 60 ready-to-play characters and henchmen.&#10;     A profile builder section, complete with special powers, traits, and a point value system, to help you create your own balanced yet characterful profiles.&#10;     7 scenarios, and scenario special rules and guidelines to help you adapt them to your needs and imagination.&#10;     and more!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "TowerRun is a standard issue Open License Print and Play Dungeon Crawl Adventure Game for 1 (solo) to 4 players. It attempts to make use of several distinguishing mechanics.&#10;&#10;First, no DM player is required. All monsters obey simple AI/automatic rules, which can be performed by anybody willing to do it. Second, dungeon crawl games often take a very long time to play due to a lot of dice rolling. TowerRun attempts to minimize this by eliminating dice rolling wherever possible, including during combat. The (hopeful) end result is not only a faster game, but a more strategic method of play. Third, there is a built in &ldquo;score&rdquo; system that single or multiple players can attempt to beat whenever they play. The game is not designed to be &ldquo;beaten&rdquo; on the first attempt, so multiple attempts are necessary, and each time you can try and beat your previous high score. Finally, a core mechanic of the game revolves around random pairings of objects and enchantments. Quite often objects have unknown enchantments that can be revealed in a calculated or risky method. Players do not know what the enchantments are until they use the item, but if they use the item without first identifying it they run the risk of it being cursed.&#10;&#10;These mechanics make for heightened tension, faster game play, and a depth of balance and strategy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums. Salem, Mass.: Parker Bros., Inc., 1905.&#10;&#10;The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums is a formalized guessing game, a contest of wit and skill in which players take turns asking riddles. The player that cannot answer loses.&#10;&#10;The &quot;What Did the Woggle-Bug Say? Contest&quot; made this Oz character a household name and inspired all kinds of novelties. That was the beginning of a &quot;Woggle-Bug&quot; craze.&#10;&#10;Parker Brothers quickly produced their own tie-in for the hype, introducing The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums the same year. The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums is a game of riddles (none having to do with Oz) produced in 1905.&#10;&#10;This is the first toy connected to the Land of Oz as it predates The Wonderful Game of OZ. This unauthorized novelty was only in production for a short time, and is the oldest Oz toy to be found.&#10;&#10;Neither Baum nor his book The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904) are mentioned anywhere on this game.&#10;&#10;The complete game consisted of a chromolithographed box containing a set of 51 gray colored Conundrum cards and 51 buff-colored Answer cards with one page &quot;Rules for Playing The Woggle Bug Game&quot; and Parker Bros. flyer for two other card games, Pit and Quit .&#10;&#10;Sampled below are some of the Woggle Bug's silly questions, and the corresponding answer cards for the game. Popular Culture themes of the time were referenced, as seen in the answer to &quot;What was Adam's favorite popular song?&quot;&#10;&#10;Some examples of the Conundrums (questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer) are:&#10;&#10; Why didn't the dog want to go into the Ark?&#10;Because he had a bark of his own.&#10;&#10;With what would you fill a barrel to make it lighter than when it was empty?&#10;Holes.&#10;&#10;What was Adam's favorite popular song?&#10;&quot;There's only one girl in the world for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;What kind of medicine does the iceman take?&#10;Pond's extract.&#10;&#10;It is unfortunate that the colorful design of the box cover did not extend to the playing cards. &#10;As this was an unauthorized game, Parker Brothers might have found it too difficult to reproduce Neill's stylish illustrations past the images of the Woggle-Bug and Jack Pumpkinhead on the box cover.&#10;&#10;The earliest toy associated with Oz and one of the rarest examples of Oziana.&#10;&#10;",

As you sail the seas trading and pirating, you travel through the ages encountering the invention of the wheel, the great pyramids, Tutankhamen's magnificent mask and other great human achievements.&#10;Can you fill your treasure chest with the most loot through cunning trading and pirating? &#10;A cut-throat game of adventure and intrigue, Riches 'n Rascals is an exciting educational game where players discover world history without any background knowledge.  No two games are exactly the same, enabling players to play indefinitely, discovering more &amp; more about world history.&#10;&#10;How Riches 'n Rascals is played:&#10;On your turn you roll the two dice (a numbered die and &lsquo;scroll&rsquo; die) and move your boat counter filed with gold, diamonds or other treasure to lands near and far.  You trade with other lands at their home port and pirate other players by landing on their boats.  If a &lsquo;scroll&rsquo; die is rolled, you consult the &lsquo;History Scrolls&rsquo; - read out what is happening in this place and time in history and follow the Scrolls&rsquo; instructions.  If great achievements are happening in history you may get to double your loot or have a second turn, if there is strife - you may lose your loot or miss a turn.  Any loot you safely bring back to your home port can be placed in your Treasure Chest where it is safe from all pirating.&#10;&#10;",

Players throw their fishing lines into the water and try to catch the colorful sea animals with their fishing rods. For added fun, sea animals also link to each other so you can catch a bunch in one try. The player who catches the most sea animals wins!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;2 fishing rods, 10 assorted sea animals (2 goldfish, 2 sharks, 2 octopus, 2 starfish and 2 lobsters). The animals float to allow for play in or out of water. The sea animals are placed in between the two players.&#10;&#10;There are four ways to play:&#10;&#10;For younger players - both players try to fish for the sea animals at the same time. They must hook an animal with the fishing rod and bring it out of the water in order to retrieve it. The player who collects the most animals wins.&#10;&#10;For older players:&#10;&#10;Links - players fish for the sea animals, trying to link as many of them as possible until all have been collected. The player with the most sea animals linked together wins.&#10;&#10;Collect-A-Set - players fish, trying to catch one of every type of sea animal. The first player to collect a complete set wins.&#10;&#10;High Score - some sea animals are easier to catch than others because they have more arms, legs, tails and fins. Each animal has a different point value: starfish &amp; octopus are worth 5 points; goldfish &amp; shark are worth 10 points; lobster is worth 20 points. The player with the most points when all animals have been collected wins.&#10;&#10;",

Both players have just one single playing piece for their regular moves. The rest of the playing pieces (34 chips for the defender, 2 tokens for the attacker) are used to keep track of the movement limitations of the players: while the attacker can use every path outside the castle only once, the defender cannot use the same path within the castle more than two subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;If the attacker manages to enter the castle exactly on the point where the defender is staying, he is the winner. If he is forced to enter the castle on an empty point, he has lost the game, because the defender will catch him on his next turn. The attacker has also lost the game, if he has no possible move left (outside of the castle).&#10;&#10;The game exists in 2 editions with different rules. According to the designer Tom Werneck, the first edition had the problem, that the attacker won in most cases, but the second edition did not help this game from being broken, because now, the defender won most times!&#10;&#10;",

It was reprinted in February 2012 and given away to people who spent $75 or more at the publisher's online store. Starting on March 6th, 2012 it briefly became available for purchase at the online store. So what had once been a highly collectible item due to its rarity, was now just another piece of Munchkin merchandise.&#10;&#10;The handbag is a standard handbag, colored pink and with a picture of the Sparkly Good Fairy from the Munchkin Fairy Dust booster pack. As a handbag, it's nothing exceptional, but it also comes with a special rule for use in any Munchkin card game that includes the Munchkin Fairy Dust expansion. The rule allows you to take a card from the Fairy Dust deck's discard pile, once per game (see the corresponding board game version for details).&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series&#10;&#10;",

Denied their dream, the Blakists sought to preserve the Star League against the follies of the Houses, but its fanaticism manifested this noble goal as the Jihad: a horrific war that has pitted every faction against each other and even themselves. Against such an anvil, new cutting edge machines of war are marched into the fire. The discovery of an ancient Hegemony Memory Core graphically showcases the desperation of the conflict, as primitive 'Mechs not seen on a battlefield since the dawn of 'Mech production over half a millennia ago once again appear.&#10;&#10;Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3075 provides a comprehensive look at the latest machines of war debuting during the Jihad: from 'Mechs to battle armor, Support Vehicles to DropShips and more. In addition, a complete &quot;Age of War&quot; section covers the Terran Hegemony and each of the five Great Houses during the Age of War, including the very first BattleMechs produced by each faction and how such machines are starting to appear once more. Each military vehicle is illustrated in detail, accompanied by a description of its history, capabilities, game stats, and some of the unit's most famous pilots.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Level II is a fast paced skirmish miniatures game, set in the future.&#10;In the year 2222 mankind manages to devastate their home planet.&#10;Nuclear fusion as well as manipulation of genes have become daily buisiness in this harsh world ruled by corporate groups.&#10;Journeys to Mars have become possible and science is about to find a way to travel to the stars.&#10;&#10;One of Level II's biggest strengths is, that it consists of a ruleset only. No miniatures come with this game!&#10;This way a player may pick any of his miniatures and calculate their point costs referring to the extremely well elaborated and very fine tuned equipment list.&#10;There are rules for about everything that has ever set it's metal or plastic foot on a futuristic war-torn gametable:&#10;Humans, aliens, different kinds of humanoids, tough races, weak races, robots, androids, crafts, cannons, artillery, sabotage, special ammunition, cybernetics - everything you could wish for.&#10;Even the equipment table basically covers everything &quot;out there&quot; - maybe you'll have to substitute sometimes some weapons (like a boltpistol with a common pistol), but you will be able to work with everything that you might find in the hands or at the belt of your miniature.&#10;&#10;The rulebook covers the basic rules as well as experts' rules and campaign rules.&#10;&#10;Even though Level II is designed for small scale skirmishes with only a couple of individual fighters per side, the rules don't prevent you from playing large scale combats as well. &#10;In that case however players should have only a few different troop types, to keep combat simple.&#10;For example on the one hand you could get about 50 - 100 light weighted fighters for 1000 points, but if you really spice them up, you may field less than 10 tough guys for the same value, too.&#10;&#10;Level II uses an unique command system:&#10;The army of a player is divided into several groups (one at least!) consisting of a number of fighters depending on the faction they are fighting for.&#10;Each group gets one command (e.g. &quot;advance&quot;), represented by a chit placed at that group's position. Depending on that command, each fighter of that group may take up to two different actions (mostly moving + something different, like e.g. taking aim).&#10;In order to change that command, certain conditions have to be met (roll versus a certain value with modifiers according to circumstances like e.g. groupleader killed or minimum distance not met) - if the roll fails the command is either changed later or even not at all.&#10;Specialits may act according to their specialities whenever the player sees fit.&#10;&#10;Level II plays very realistically: Most weapons kill an unarmoured human with one hit - just as in real life. This way you will have to be very careful with about everything: &#10;How are you going to spend your points?&#10;Where and (even mor important:) how are you going to move your fighters?&#10;This way, Level II is a very tactical skirmish game where the skill and the experience of a player garantee a victory instead of lucky dierolls.&#10;&#10;",

Each player also receives one of eight coded Assignments, which is decoded in the spy's Passport. The combination of the Secret Assignment with the Secret Identity determines how each player can win the game.&#10;Secret Assignments are to gather specific Secret Cards (ie. Missile Secrets, Political Secrets, Computer Secrets, Trade Secrets etc) and smuggle them out of each game by combining them with various Smuggle Cards (Dead Drop, Diplomatic Pouch, Radio Transmission). Assignments carry varying rewards based upon their difficulty.&#10;Depending on their Secret Identity traits, spies may also steal cards from each other, set bombs as traps, kill each other with Dagger Cards, expose other spies identities and/or assignments, or place them in detention in attempting to be the first spy to complete his or her Secret Mission.&#10;Due to the many various combinations of Identities with Assignments, the game is constantly presenting new and different possibilities for players and has great replay value.&#10;A player wins the game by being the first spy to complete his or her Secret Mission. Multiple hands can be played successively, constituting the Great Game.&#10;Source: Publisher Statement&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simple dice game with two special dice and depending on the symbols or numbers rolled you add another ante, get part of or the whole jackpot.&#10;&#10;Famous for the ad for the game as a hint to a conspiracy theory. The ad shows, among others, the numbers 12 and 7 and talks about peoples in airraid shelters in November 1941. This led to a FBI investigation to see if it was a secret code by the Japanese Intelligence Agency for the attack on Pearl Harbour to warn their agents in the US.&#10;&#10;The investigation led to a negative result, but the fame of the game stayed.&#10;&#10;",
