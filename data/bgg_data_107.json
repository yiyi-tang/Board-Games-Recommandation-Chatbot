    "Description": "The Panzer Grenadier series in North Africa. Fifty scenarios that cover the armored clashes of 1940 and 1941. Players take command of platoon sized units representing German, British, Australian and Italian infantry, tanks and artillery. Standalone addition to the Panzer Grenadier series of games.&#10;&#10;After shipping troops and supplies to the Italian colony of Libya, the army there finally invaded British-held Egypt in September 1940. A series of campaigns followed as first one side and then the other gained the upper hand.&#10;&#10;Afrika Korps covers the battles from the first segment of this campaign, in the Panzer Grenadier game system. The fifty scenarios range from the initial Italian raids of June 1940 to the Allied &ldquo;Operation Brevity&rdquo; of May 1941. Actions range from small but intense infantry fights to wide, sweeping tank battles. Afrika Korps is a complete standalone game, not requiring any other products for full enjoyment.  All the troops and tanks of the British, Australian, Italian and German armies that fought in Libya and Egypt are included.&#10;&#10;Afrika Korps has the largest playing surface in the series, with three 22x34 maps printed on heavy paper.  Of the 50 scenarios, 40 of them only require one map, and only 2 require all 3.&#10;&#10;Note that this game has garnered quite a lot of criticism for the depiction of some of the Italian standard infantry counters unarmed with their hands in the air (surrendering), which none of the Allied counters have.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Sinister Forces&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: South Africa's War&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

Even a SdJ edition exists!&#10;&#10;Each game consists of 340 cards and can be played stand-alone or mixed together with some or all of the other editions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NHL Ice Breaker is licensed by the National Hockey League and features the league&rsquo;s 30 teams plus national teams. You get all the great action of the game on the ice with NHL Ice Breaker. Game play is built around CSE Games' specially-designed 54-card playing deck (52 standard suited cards plus two Jokers). Each action in NHL Ice Breaker is based on the basic principle of high hand wins. Opponents play their card(s) at the same time to battle for puck possession, and the player with the highest hand gets to execute his/her action indicated on the card(s) played.&#10;&#10;As players win hands, the puck is moved up the ice (game board) and toward the opponent's net. Along the way, players may land on special &ldquo;Ice Breaker&rdquo; squares, which can shift momentum in an instant. Ice Breaker actions include penalties, big hits, turnovers or great passes. Once in the Shooting Zone, it's a classic contest of shooter versus goalie. Did you play your cards right?&#10;&#10;NHL Ice Breaker separates itself from other hockey-based games in that it has a true hockey 'feel'. The game is both accurate and fast-paced. Combining elements of popular card games, players must decide how best to play their cards. Cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, or three-of-a-kind. It is up to the player to decide which cards to play and how to play them.&#10;&#10;The learning curve of NHL Ice Breaker is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned within a couple of minutes, aided by the built-in familiarity that the playing deck offers. NHL Ice Breaker is designed for one to four players, ages eight (8) and up.&#10;&#10;For more information, check out www.csegames.com.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hearing I ask from the holy races, from Heimdall&rsquo;s sons, both high and low; Thou wilt, Valfather, that well I relate old tales I remember of men long ago. (Poetic Edda &ndash; V&ouml;luspa &ndash; The Prophecy of the Seeress, stanza 1).&#10;&#10;Nine worlds, one destination. Driven by the call of the Nordic gods, 2 to 4 jarls, rulers of Viking villages, embark on an adventurous journey through the nine worlds of Yggdrasil to Asgard. But only the most glorious of them will be admitted to their halls. And so the players set off - with only a handful of mostly inexperienced residents of their villages at first - to experience adventures on land and at sea.&#10;&#10;The Norse mythical world of the Vikings consists of 9 different worlds that players will get to know in this &quot;deck building game&quot;, such as Midgard, the world of humans, or J&ouml;tunheim, the realm of the frost giants. During their travels, other Vikings will join the players, they will learn about mysterious places, seek the help of the gods, fight against dangerous opponents and try to escape overpowering dangers without damage.&#10;&#10;The basic game, briefly explained by a &ldquo;tutorial&rdquo;, has a modular structure and can be expanded almost as much as desired with additional game material. So little by little, new and more demanding rules come into play. While always 8 adventures (rounds) will be played, these can be put together from 35 different adventures almost any way the players want. Since players choose to play adventures from 3 of the 9 Viking worlds and because each world features other Vikings with different skills and other special rules, players can also adjust the level of difficulty and the duration of the game by their choice of Viking worlds.&#10;&#10;With each adventure, players learn more about the legends of Nordic mythology, which graphic artist Michael Menzel brought to life with atmospheric illustrations on various cards, amongst them 34 different Vikings.&#10;&#10;From the adventure cards that are placed on the gameboard, players will learn more about the secrets and mythical characters of Nordic mythology. The cards also show a section of the journey ahead. Playing their Viking cards skillfully, players move their Viking figures over this path, collect gold, get glory (victory points) and try to avoid the dangers of the path. With gold they can recruit other Vikings with better skills, filling the card deck with increasingly helpful Vikings. Vikings who fought bravely can be sent to Walhalla. This creates a second deck of cards with Vikings who will assist the players in the often-decisive final adventure at the rainbow bridge Bifr&ouml;st and can also help them win with the victory points they contain.&#10;&#10;",

They only have 40 days to find and stop the ritual, before the world comes to an untimely end!&#10;&#10;The core of the game revolves around a system of encounter tables that will generate terrifying events and will provide the players with clues, arcane items, and more terrifying events! Combat is dice-based and highly tactical, due to the many options the players have in their attack and defense phases.&#10;&#10;Relevant features include:&#10;&#10;     8 new classes of main Investigators, plus MANY types of Helpers for nuanced customization...&#10;     ... but the players shouldn't get too attached to any character in particular. High lethality.&#10;     insanity, curses &amp; incorporeal enemies to make the challenge even harder&#10;     many spells, arcane items, weapons (did someone say flamethrower???)&#10;     6 possible epic final encounters, each a complete mini-game&#10;     clue system that actually gives the players information as they investigate, allowing them to gradually narrow down the possible location of the ritual&#10;     race against the clock: limited time to complete the adventure&#10;     side quests to exotic locations and... other planets?&#10;     enter the Dreamlands at your own risk!&#10;     many secrets hidden in the game to increase replay value.

    "Description": "(from VaeVictis website:)&#10;&#10;On his way to the Holy Land, Richard Coeur de Lion (the Lionheart) arrived at Cyprus. The ruler of the island, Isaac Dukas Comnenus, tried unsuccessfully to repel the Crusaders&rsquo; landing before falling back to Nicosia to regroup his forces. Once assured of the safety of his fleet, Richard set off into the interior of the island. Isaac marched against him, hoping to confront him in a vast plain favorable to the maneuvers of the redoubtable Byzantine cavalry. The clash occurred near the village of Tremithousa on May 21, 1191. The cavalry charges were horrendous and for a time the issue was in doubt, but the Anglo-Normans&rsquo; heavy knights finally prevailed. Isaac was captured, and this caused the Greeks to rout. Richard, now in control of Cyprus, could resume his journey to the Holy Land.&#10;He joined Philip Augustus at Saint Jean d&rsquo;Acre, which fell on July 12. When Philip returned to France, Richard gained sole command of the Crusader army. He marched south with the intention of liberating Jerusalem, but on September 7, 1194, Saladin attacked the Christians as they made their way down the coast. Showered with arrows, the Hospitaliers launched a premature charge, forcing Richard to give the signal for a general attack. After a violent counterattack, Saladin&rsquo;s troops were finally vanquished by one last charge of the Crusaders. Richard the Lionheart soon reconquered the coastlands, after which he negotiated an agreement with Saladin which allowed pilgrims free access to Jerusalem.&#10;&#10;Tremithousa and Arsuf 1191 are the 31st and 32nd battles of the series Au fil de l&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e / By the Edge of the Sword, launched in issue 26 of the magazine Vae Victis. The game includes two battles won by Richard the Lionheart during the course of the Third Crusade, the first battle being fought on Cyprus against Isaac Comnenus and the second in the Holy Land against Saladin.&#10;&#10;Le Lion et l'Ep&eacute;e / The Lion &amp; the Sword includes :&#10;&#10;    two 59 x 40 cm maps (one sheet backprinted), &#10;    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers, &#10;    rules and scenarios booklet &#10;    player-aid card in color.&#10;&#10;&#10;Units : 1 strength point per 100 combatants&#10;Map scale : 250 m/hex.&#10;Turn : 30 minutes&#10;Complexity : 6/9&#10;&#10;&#10;Battles: Tremetousia (Cyprus, May 21 1191) and Arsuf (Holy Land, September 7 1191).&#10;&#10;",

And with its vast Caspian oil reserves, the South of Russia was an irresistible target for the Wehrmacht's next offensive. At least for Hitler it was.&#10;&#10;In this operational level game, players maneuver colorful cardboard playing pieces on two beautifully illustrated four-color maps of Southern Russia. These playing pieces, representing panzer regiments, tank corps, and infantry divisions, are based upon the actual military units involved. &#10;Additional counters represent headquarter and cavalry units, supply transports, air support, and the historical commanders of the armies. A hexagonal grid superimposed upon the map regulates deployment, movement, and battle engagement of the playing pieces. The roll of a die on simple probability charts determines each combat's outcome. In DRIVE ON STALINGRAD, players recreate Hitler's gamble in the summer of '42.&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; maps &#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16 page rules booklet&#10;Two player aid Charts &amp; Tables&#10;One Game-Turn Record &amp; Reinforcement Track&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Playing Time: 3 - 7 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Divisional-level game of the German drive across the Don in the summer and fall of 1942, using a modified version of the Panzergruppe Guderian system.

    "Description": "Strike - Counter Strike: 4th Armored Division vs Panzer Lehr along the Saar is designed as an entry-level game as an introduction to the Series: Grand Tactical (MMP) by Multi-Man Publishing.&#10;&#10;Strike - Counter Strike is a small footprint, low counter density Grand Tactical Series game with minimal exclusive rules meant to provide a quick, easy introduction to the Grand Tactical Series. The game highlights the elegance and fun of the GTS at gaming maneuver warfare at the company level. The Saar battle was chosen as a topic of interest because of the size of the forces involved, the limited battlespace and time period, and most importantly, because it pits two mobile forces against each other, both with the chance to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;In November 1944, the advances of the US Army XII Corps and XV Corps threatened the boundary between the German First and Nineteenth Armies. General Balck, Commander of German Army Group G ordered Generalleutnant Bayerlein's Panzer Lehr Division to attack southward along the Saar River into the flank of the US Army XV Corps to stop its advance east.&#10;&#10;Unknown to Bayerlein, the situation of the Panzer Lehr was precarious. While the German division was moving south, the XII Corps' 4th Armored Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. John S. &quot;P&quot; Wood, advanced west toward the Saar River before advancing north. Judging the soggy ground west of the Saar River to be unsuitable for armored operations, Maj. Gen. Wood obtained permission to have the American armored unit's CCB move eastward across the Saar River into the XV Corps' zone, before swinging north toward Sarre-Union. A clash between the two opposing armored formations was inevitable.&#10;&#10;Strike - Counter Strike simulates the attack of the Panzer Lehr Division into the flank of the US XV Corps, the delaying actions by 106th Cavalry Group, the defense by the 44th Infantry Division, and the counterattack by the 4th Armored Division. The game covers the afternoon of 23 November to the afternoon of 27 November 1944. The German commands the Panzer Lehr Division and the American player commands parts of two divisions an a single map.&#10;&#10;Originally published in the 44 page magazine GTS Briefing Vol 1 (May 2023) by Multi-Man Publishing&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 hours daylight / 8 - 12 hours night time&#10;Hex: 547 yards / 500 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;Two dual-side printed full countersheets (352 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One dual-side printed half countersheet (88 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Strike - Counter Strike Exclusive rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC player aid cards&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;Note 1: Players will need to provide Grand Tactical Series Rules v2.0c to play.&#10;Note 2: Players will need to provide one 10-sided die for game play.&#10;&#10;",

In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make a suggestion against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards mentioned if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more suggestions.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file, and then make an accusation. If correct, the player wins, but if incorrect, the player must return the cards to the file without revealing them and may no longer make suggestions or accusations. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.&#10;&#10;Note: There are some early versions of Clue which are labeled as 2-6 players. Recent and current issues of the game state 3-6 players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players try to move their grasshoppers across the board to their opponent's corner while simultaneously stopping their opponent from doing the same. A random tile layout makes the board different each time you play.&#10;&#10;Your grasshoppers have hidden numbers 1-9 (1-7 in the online version) and the more you can get to the opposite corner, the better your score. The hoppers move 1, 2, or 3 spaces, depending if they jump from a water space, a flower or a leaf. The hoppers move forward to empty spaces, but can jump backwards if they are taking an opponents' piece. Captured pieces are also worth 1 pt each.&#10;&#10;When the board is laid out, the players sit at opposing corners, so the hoppers move orthogonally on the board, but diagonally to the players' view. This can distract you such that you don't quite recognize when a capture might happen.&#10;&#10;One of the best features of Subulata is that one hopper may threaten other hoppers without being at risk itself. This allows you to build an attack from which there is no defense. As the game opens, you might choose to move to attack, or try to slip by safely. But that leaves your home free to be occupied.

Once a player loses both honey drops, the game ends and whoever has the most honey drops in hand wins.&#10;&#10;The HABA edition of Strong Stuff! includes a special die for experienced players in which you're challenged to spin Bruno in place or move him only with your right or left hand.

    "Description": "Deck of Wonders is a solo-first expandable card game with legacy elements. It captures the feel of games like Hearthstone and MTG, but in a solo/co-op format.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to defeat the various Villains that challenge you for the Deck of Wonders by turning their own spells and minions against them, while enlisting the support of magical creatures and powers of your own.&#10;&#10;The story is that you&rsquo;ve stolen the Deck of Wonders from Fate herself and, as you make your escape, all manner of magical creatures start coming out of the woodwork to both help and hinder you. Chief among these are Fate&rsquo;s Villains, who are hunting for the Deck of Wonders at her command (or perhaps for their own selfish reasons).&#10;&#10;When the game starts, you select the Villain you want to face off against. Each Villain has a set of special rules you MUST follow and a set of cards that you MUST use in your deck as long as you're facing them. To their cards you add additional cards from your Collection, which forms the deckbuilding challenge of the game: what cards should you add to the deck that can take advantage of the special rules, and combo with or counter the Villain's cards?&#10;&#10;All these cards go into the same deck, which you and the Villain take turns drawing from. This works because each card has two halves: one to use if drawn on the Player turn, and one to use if drawn on the Villain turn. The Villain halves are stronger, faster, and more powerful than yours (Fate is on their side after all), but they will attack mindlessly following a simple set of rules called the Priority System. It's up to you to outplay the stronger Villain by manipulating the Priority System and leveraging the synergies of the deck you've built!&#10;&#10;As you defeat Villains and progress in the game, you will unlock special legacy packs. Each legacy pack will have special cards that alter the play experience in surprising ways, forcing you to change your strategic approach. Once a Villain is fully defeated, you can add their cards to your Collection for use against other, more powerful Villains. You may even unlock special, permanent upgrades for your cards! You&rsquo;ll need every bit of help you can get to stay in front of the difficulty curve, and the choices you make around what to upgrade turn your collection into a unique representation of your decisions and play style.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.&#10;&#10;Five horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.&#10;&#10;That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.&#10;&#10;Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).&#10;&#10;The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.&#10;&#10;",

It is a corps-level simulation of the battle in Europe during World War II.&#10;&#10;Advanced ETO is much more than just another World War II strategy game; Advanced ETO is an accurate simulation of the war in Europe, with historically accurate forces and combat units! All of the game's combat units have been exhaustively researched for technical accuracy (derived from the actual military TO&amp;Es of World War II). The naval and air units have been meticulously recreated as well, reflecting the authentic performance and abilities of these implements of war.&#10;&#10;Better yet, Advanced ETO's production model is an exact duplication of the actual production figures from the Second World War, providing players with a genuine simulation of the industrial aspect of World War II in Europe. As such, Advanced ETO contains almost twice as many pieces as the original ETO (over 2200!), including new mechanized, mountain, commando and cavalry units, additional naval and aircraft types, more Generals and even Admirals. For you naval buffs; Advanced ETO now contains absolutely every capital ship that existed during World War II, including additional aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and raiders. Advanced ETO even includes numerous naval vessels that were planned but never completed-allowing the players some very interesting &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If air power is your forte, Advanced ETO includes just about every type of combat air unit that saw action in Europe during World War II. This includes many of the rare types, such as the P-61 &quot;Black Widow,&quot; the Fw 200 &quot;Condor,&quot; Yak-9, Bloch 174, &quot;Defiant&quot; and many, many more.&#10;&#10;And that's not all!&#10;&#10;Advanced ETO has two new beautiful 23 x 34 inch maps that encompass all of Europe and North Africa-everything from the icy Arctic Ocean to the deserts of the Middle East, including over 38 nations and  territories, newly researched topography, additional cities and ports (such as Dresden, Leeds, Gorki, and even the Azores, just to name a few). Newly added technically accurate rail road lines, updated resource areas, plus additional rivers and lakes. Virtually every aspect of World War II in Europe is here. Best of all, Advanced ETO can be played as an exciting grand strategic game (from the beginning of the war to the end), or as one of the many quick campaigns or scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Caf&eacute; del Gatto, you want to serve valuable drinks to customers, but you're competing against other baristas for coffee and milk, so making drinks will be tricky!&#10;&#10;To set up, each player takes five glass tiles that require 1-4 &quot;shots&quot; to complete. Place the 36 coffee/milk tiles in the bag, then draw five tiles to fill the milk side of the espresso machine, then five tiles to fill the coffee side. Each double-sided coffee/milk tile has a value from 1-4 as well as a symbol for cold, hot, or foamy. Each player starts with 4-5 coins. Place completed drink tiles in the center of the playing area; each drink (cappuccino, latte macchiato, etc.) has tiles of varying values.&#10;&#10;On a turn, take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take 2 coins from the bank.&#10;     Buy a tile from the espresso machine, with the cost of the tile being equal to the adjacent tile on the opposite side of the machine. If you're buying a milk tile, for example, the cost is the value on the adjacent coffee tile. Tiles in the top two rows have a 1-2 coin surcharge. Place the tile in the lowest empty matching space on one of your drink tiles, then draw a tile from the bag to refill the machine. If you buy a 1 tile, it comes with a bonus sugar cube.&#10;     Serve one or more completed drinks. For each glass tile that has all its spots filled, first gain coins from the bank, earning more coins if the drink has fewer symbols in it. (Mixing cold and hot tiles isn't good!) Next, take a completed drink tile of the same type that has a value equal to or less than the sum of the tiles, gaining coins to make up the difference. You can raise the value of a drink by 1 for each sugar cube spent.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you can spend 2 coins to flush one side of the espresso machine, then refill it.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has served all five types of drinks, complete the round, then sum the value of your completed drink tiles, with each pair of sugar cubes counting as 1 point. Whoever has the most points wins, with coin serving as a tiebreaker.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes her character sheet, miniature and 7-10 action cards.

Each hero player has four actions in a round, and the players can play in any order they wish; the actions are move across the base, attack an enemy, or use a special power on a played action card or the hero's character sheet.&#10;&#10;Professor Skarov then receives a number of action points based partially on the heroes' actions, and he uses these to activate himself, his minions, or his robots, with these figures also performing move, attack, or special power actions.&#10;&#10;As the players complete (or fail to complete) objectives, the newspapers report on who did what, and the sum of those reports determine who comes out on top.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Every year, villagers gather from far and wide for the harvest festival. They bring fine carpets to the market and share delicious mango juice while praying men honor the holy cows, and the children tease mischievous monkeys and gasp at the snake charmers. But the main event of the festival is the elephant race. Young men and women of the region spend days painting joyous and reverent decorations on their elephant partners for this one moment when they can surge through the crowds of festive villagers, push and shove their way past other racing pachyderms, and brave the tiger-filled forests to win honor for themselves and their proud elephant friends. The bell rings, the elephants trumpet their excitement, and the race begins!&#10;&#10;Elephant Rally, which was first released as Formula E, is a game in which 3 to 6 players race their elephant pawns through an Indian village, over treacherous mountains, and across parched deserts seeking to be the first one to complete the course.&#10;&#10;The primary game mechanism in Elephant Rally is hand management as players use their hand of cards to advance their elephants through the course. Elephants move in a unique manner &ndash; they push elephants in front of them until those elephants hit an obstacle, then the active elephant pushes sideways until a path is clear for it to move forward again. Certain move-adjusting cards and tactical-screwage cards can be played to trigger events like diagonal movement, obstacle movement, and nasty little screw-your-opponents effects. Elephant racing is not necessarily a sport of honor!&#10;&#10;",

For the initial round, it would be 1 or 0. Then, other players play one of their number cards face down. After that, reveal all the number cards and add up the numbers. If that total equals the number of a gambler cards, any player who hired that gambler gets the reward accordingly.&#10;&#10;Play continues this way until a player collects 15 coins or more.

Skipped numbers cannot be marked in the future. Thus, on each turn, each player makes 0-6 marks on their player sheet. The active player then passes the dice left.&#10;&#10;The final three columns on a player sheet are designated the &quot;target area&quot;. If any player marks two spaces in a single row in the target area, that die is removed from the game at the end of that turn. When the third die is removed from play, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Each player then scores each row and each column on their player sheet, losing 5 points if only one mark is present, scoring 0 points for zero or two marks, and score 5+ points for 3+ marks.

The case got opened the 20th of September 2007, and got the final verdict the 19th of March 2010, where Jungle Speed rights won. Joueclub had to compensated and set up a recall where they managed to get back 2/3 of the 3&#226;&#128;&#175;473 games sold, after the forbidding of the commercialization of Jungle Jam.&#10;&#10;Sources : &#10;- http://users.skynet.be/fa315353/junglejam.htm&#10;- https://www.doctrine.fr/d/TGI/Paris/2010/FRB9EAD37936B2434C0086&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rebel Nox is a highly tactical team-based card game with shifting alliances and a hint of social deduction. It is a stand-alone game set in the world of Capital Lux.&#10;&#10;&#10;The world of Lux is in uproar and rebels and loyalist fight for control of the capital. Who is on your side? Will your team gather enough followers to seize power? And who is true to your cause when it looks lost?&#10;&#10;With the cards dealt at the beginning of the game, players are assigned to either the Rebel team or the Loyalist team. The two teams fight for control over locations that alter the rules in that particular fight, and provide influence to the winner. Play your cards tactically to establish who is on your team, take control of locations and make sure your team has the most influence at the end of the round. But as cards change hands, allegiances can change, so who can you really trust? Perhaps you secretly switched team yourself?&#10;&#10;The near endless combinations of locations and card distribution make for a vast number of unique situations and tactical challenges, ensuring no two games will ever feel the same.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game flow: &#10;At the beginning of each round, six locations are placed in the middle of the table and each player is dealt nine cards. If you were dealt a rebel card, you announce that you are on the rebel team; if you do not have a rebel card, you are on the loyalist team.&#10;&#10;The player who was dealt the &quot;rebel commander&quot; chooses a location for the first fight, and leads by playing the first card.&#10;&#10;The game then plays like a trick taking game, but with some important differences: certain cards will alter who wins the location (assassins take out the highest card, making the second highest card win instead), flags increases the value of the current location (play them when you think a team mate will win), and infiltrators make cards switch hands (for every infiltrator symbol played, the player who played the lowest card must draw one card from the hand of the winning player). With tactical card play you can both influence who wins the location and how much it is worth. But as cards switches hands, you may not be sure who is on which team.&#10;&#10;After all six locations have been won, players reveal which side they are on (if you have a rebel card, you are on the rebel team; if not, you are on the loyalist team).  Players now collect followers for their controlled influence, and all players on the team that controls the most influence are awarded bonus followers. If one team has managed to gather a required number of followers, they win the game. If not, another round must be played.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Can you make a word with the letters in your hand, and what letters that may or may not be in your opponents&rsquo;?&#10;&#10;Players start by playing one letter of a word and saying a target word. Then subsequent players build up the target word, either playing the next letter if they can, or by changing the target word dynamically if it can&rsquo;t be continued. Can your word be finished for positive points, or can you trap your opponent into not being able to play and force them to pick up the unfinished word for negative points? Can you outwit your player with cleverness? If your opponent finishes your word for you say &ldquo;Kiitos&rdquo;, the Finnish word for thank-you.&#10;&#10;The rules change dynamically as the game is played and the game play switches between two modes: Kiitos which builds up words from left to right, and Super-Kiitos which builds up words at either end. Dubious words can be challenged. Fake words are OK if you can get them past your opponent unchallenged. Kiitos edge-case tests the dictionary like no other game.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a word game that feels somewhat like a trick-taking game, with a bit of deduction and bluffing. Lateral thinking and clever strategising are rewarded, sometimes. Luck can make or break your strategies. The target word can change 5 or more times just in the one hand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A set is considered to outrank previously played set if it were a same type of set with higher value.  A player may also outrank the previously played set with a same type of set having the same value by exhausting one PASS token.  The next player may do the same, however, by exhausting even one more PASS token.&#10;     Pass: The active player takes a PASS token.  The pass token can be used in a future turn to augment a played set, or to turn one of the cards in a played set to its upgraded side.&#10;&#10;&#10;The plays who plays all his/her hand first will gain a victory token and all cards will be reshuffled and dealt again.

Search cards allow you to look behind, under and inside these objects for clues.  Try to add rooms that you suspect contain objects that match Search cards in your hand.  If you have a Search card that matches an object in the same room as your pawn, play it and draw a Clue card.  The clue might be a Treasure Chest, a Key to a chest, a Secret Passage or just Cobwebs and Dust.  If you own a key that matches a chest, haul the chest out of the mansion to unlock it.  Once it's outside, the big moment comes as you open the lid.  Will it be filled with gold and jewels or cobwebs and dust?&#10;&#10;",

For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone.&#10;&#10;You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day. You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another.

Two special forces camps, a handful of elite soldiers, and thirty miles of rugged, jungled terrain were all that stood between the onrushing NVA and their objective, the strategic town of Pleiku. The NVA quickly surrounded and besieged the camps, threatening a quick and easy victory over the outnumbered II Corps defenders. Desperate to hold back the tide of Communist soldiers, the South Vietnamese commander asked the U.S. for help.&#10;&#10;The newly formed 1st Cavalry Division, fresh in country and bivouacked at nearby An Khe, rushed to the aid of the beleaguered garrisons. With its complement of over 400 combat helicopters, the 1st Cav was completely airmobile. While the helicopter's mobility guaranteed quick movement and ready resupply, it did not guarantee victory. The soldiers that the unblooded Americans faced were tough, well trained veterans. Victory would not come easily for the Americans.&#10;&#10;Between October 23 and November 25, 1965, a desperate struggle between a full North Vietnamese Army Division and the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division took place west of Pleiku in Vietnam's Central Highlands.

Launching with Star Wars: Episode III toys, ATTACKTIX is a battle figure game that combines great action figures with kinetic battling features.&#10;&#10;Each figure comes on a base that contains all of the information that a trading card might include, such as speed, defense, point value and special powers unique to that character.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is simple: be the last one standing; but beyond that there are nearly unlimited strategies.  To begin, kids select how many points each squad should start out with, pick their squads and put them into formation.  On each turn, kids will move their figures across the table (counting distance using a patented clicking wheel in the base), and then attack with features like slashing light sabers, firing projectiles and others.  When the figures are knocked over, their special powers come into play and influence the game.  For example, granting another one of your figures an attack or bringing back a figure who may have been previously defeated.&#10;&#10;This version is based on characters in the Star Wars Universe.&#10;&#10;There are multiple themes in the Attacktix series of games.&#10;&#10;",

Using content from their Strange Adventures in Infinite Space computer game, Cheapass has made the new Diceland into a ship-to-ship combat game.&#10;&#10;From the Cheapass Games website:&#10;&#10;Diceland is a tabletop combat game that uses paper dice as the characters. The dice are eight-sided, printed in full color, and about 2 inches to a side. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles with just tabs and slots. The &quot;paper&quot; in these paper dice is 12-point coated cardstock, which makes these dice solid enough to withstand any amount of normal play.&#10;&#10;Diceland: Space is a 50-die expansion for Diceland, which comes in two different 25-die boxes. The set introduces new abilities like Cloak, Remove, Dodge, and more, and gives players their first chance to construct customized Diceland armies. Each box contains two major armies, one smaller one, and a strange and wonderful 25th die.&#10;&#10;Space: Terrans vs. Urluquai includes an 11-die Terran army, featuring a fast-moving wing of Scouts and a powerful 15-point Destroyer; the 8-die Urluquai army including both a Corvette and a Fighter with the Cloaking ability; and the 5-die Zorg army, with a fat carrier and a unique Tender which can teleport enemies off the board. Also in the Terrans vs. Urluquai box, you&rsquo;ll find the friendly Klakar Frigate, an impressive 16-point frigate that&rsquo;s a perfect addition to any army that can afford him.&#10;&#10;Space: Garthans vs. Muktians includes an 11-die Garthan army, featuring both the Light and Super Carriers as well as a vast array of small Fighters; the 8-die Muktian army featuring a mix of unusual ship designs; and the 5-die Tan Ru army, featuring a powerhouse 15-point Decimator and a wing of three mindless Drones. Also in the Garthans vs. Muktians box, you'll find the 50-point Yellow Kawangi die, a bizarre and powerful die that's sure to be illegal in tournaments any day now.&#10;&#10;List of Diceland sets and armies&#10;&#10;",

Is your gaming group looking for something quick and fun without pages and pages of rules? Look no further!&#10;&#10;The Shivers is a truly one-of-a-kind tabletop experience that features the magic of hand-crafted pop-ups, combined with just the right amount of spooky puzzle-solving mystery and role playing.&#10;&#10;Using our patent-pending modular pop-up system, the mystery will unfold as you and your friends explore a magical mansion, as one of the members of the Shivers family. Each episode takes about an hour to play cooperatively, with one person taking the lead as the Storyteller. Once players finish one episode, a quick change of the system reveals the next story which will be completely new and unique: filled with new clues, puzzles, room layouts, and foes to vanquish.&#10;&#10;The Shivers is fun and challenging for young kids, teens, and even older experienced game players. While most games have dozens of pages of rules and take many hours to learn and play, Shivers players have just a couple simple rules, and can get up and playing in less than 5 minutes. Similar to an escape room in structure and feel (but on a much smaller scale), players can get immediately immersed in the mystery, discovering the right path forward as they progress.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;For each scenario, one player takes on the role of the &quot;storyteller&quot;, which is akin to an RPG GameMaster (GM). They know the whole story, and facilitate the rest of the players as they play the game. They are not an adversary, as they can't win or lose. Their goal is to make the game as fun as possible for the group.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The original edition came out in 1963 in a double-size box. The large box was nearly twice the area of a traditional AH box. Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.&#10;&#10;The rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.&#10;&#10;Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one hex) or retreat (two hexes) after combat.  Units have one-hex thick zones of control; movement directly from one hex in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining hex of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one hex per turn movement), mountains (one hex per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten hex movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.&#10;&#10;Several extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2&#10;&#10;",

The game requires you to supply the playing surface (the rules are designed for either a hex field or a completely free form field) and the dice (which ideally should read 0-5 instead of 1-6). The counters are supplied on a laminated piece of paper roughly the same quality as the cover of the book, you must cut them out.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with each player secretly marking down how much thrust they are applying to which thrusters on their ships. These are simultaneously revealed, and thrust markers are added/removed as needed. Because space is a vacuum, thrust applied in one direction will mean you go in that direction until you compensate for it!&#10;&#10;The next part of the turn is the combat phase. Players must roll the dice to determine if they can still see their opponent. If they can see their enemy can they shoot. All the players fire their weapons simultaneously, and then they apply the results of hits and criticals at the same time. The turn is now complete.&#10;&#10;There are significant technological differences between the American and German spacecraft. The German craft are generally more powerful, but have a limited supply of fuel and weapons, while the American craft are weaker, but their fuel and weapons supply automatically recharges each turn.&#10;&#10;Hard Vacuum is aimed at any fan of classic sci-fi, dogfight, or space combat games. It has a lighter, almost comic book quality in its setting and the game does not get bogged down by complex rules or mechanics. Once the game mechanics are mastered (which does not take long), a complete game can be played in under an hour.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Hard Vacuum: Science Gone Mad&#10;     Hard Vacuum: War's End&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The Ancestral Turtle moves 1 space along it's path for each symbol at the end of the player's turn. If the turtle swims twice around the island, the island is the winner and all players lose.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the last member of a tribe is killed, the game is over. &#10;Each meeple is worth the value of the square they end on.

The game contains five fictional train companies based in different Swedish cities on the map.&#10;&#10;A game of 18Svea follows a fixed set of rounds. Four Stock Rounds (SR) when players manage their private shareholder investments in available train companies mixed with seven Operations Rounds (OR) when train companies expand their rail network, establish train stations, run trains, and generate money to its shareholders. The game also contains twelve strategy cards which ensures that every game will be different. When the game ends, the player with highest combined wealth in money and company shares wins the game.&#10;&#10;18Svea is heavily inspired by the fantastic 18XX train games originally developed or inspired by Francis Tresham and do not normally involve dice rolling or other random events during play. Apart from shuffling the deck of strategy cards and potentially rolling one die once when determining the placement of an off-board connection, players must rely on their own ability to outwit and outmaneuver each other while playing. In 18Svea the luck factor is small, and the player interaction factor is very high already from round one.&#10;&#10;",

Captain America &mdash; or an ostrich?&#10;&#10;In Platypus, players co-operate to gradually eliminate bad words in order to find and identify the &quot;platypus&quot; through their adjective cards. To set up, eight common words or proper names &mdash; the &quot;platypus&quot; cards &mdash; are placed face up in front of all the players. The guides know the card that the explorers must guess, and to help the explorers, they give clues in the form of adjective cards that best define the platypus for them. Each guide has a hand of four clue cards, and after each new clue, the explorers must eliminate one or two cards that they think don't match what's being defined by the clues. If the explorers eliminate the platypus, then everyone loses; if they succeed four times, however, then the platypus will stand alone and everyone wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game centers around a deck of 15 cards. On your turn, draw a card from the deck and place it into one of the two rooms. When you &quot;open&quot; the room to add the card, you look at the cards already present and resolve their effects in ascending numerical order. Some effects will remove cards to the casualty area, others will cause cards to switch rooms, and so on. While this is happening, the other player must keep their eyes closed.&#10;&#10;The game comes with four difficulty levels, and the players win if the Cloaked Vampire is placed in the casualty area and the players know the location of one of the human cards, Nina. The players lose in a number of ways, such as Nina entering the casualty area or the deck running out of cards.&#10;&#10;",

Each player represents the commander of one faction&rsquo;s forces. Unfortunately, each player&rsquo;s position as a Governor / Viceroy / Satrap is tenuous in relation to their larger civilization which is why you were assigned here, to the armpit of space and with scant resources, instead of to your glorious core worlds controlling the newest and best forces.&#10;&#10;In the grand scheme of things, you seek to build a good reputation and make the best of your near-exile to the Star Borders, so that you can leave by advancing your career and family name.&#10;&#10;Star Borders is played on connected maps arranged to represent a contested region of space. Players vie for dominance in the regions created by controling planets, nebulas, and asteroid fields. One player controls the movement and combat of the Alliance (blue) spaceforce, while the other controls the movement and combat of the Imperium (red) spaceforce. Each player, in turn, moves and then engages in combat with his units, in an attempt to capture (or prevent from being captured) key locations (e.g., planets) on the map.

Its distinctive feature among those games is the use of various pair-runs like 2-2-3-3-4-4 to trump single and pairs of 2s.&#10;&#10;The game is for four players. A standard 52 card deck is used. There are no Jokers and no wild cards.&#10;&#10;The ranking of the cards is: Two (highest), Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three (lowest).&#10;Within each rank there is also an order of suits: Hearts (highest), Diamonds, Clubs, Spades (lowest).&#10;&#10;Among climbing games, Tien Len's most distinctive feature is its unique mechanic for &quot;bombing&quot; the high deuces: a 3-finger run (e.g. 445566) trumps a single 2; a 4-finger run (e.g. 44556677) trumps a pair of 2's; a 5-finger run trumps a trio of 2's; and a 6-finger run beats a quad of 2s.&#10;&#10;",

In this world, cowpokes good and bad wield guns, steampunk gadgets, and spells of all sorts, and death is sometimes just a minor inconvenience.&#10;&#10;In Deadwood, South Dakota, Eagle woman That All Look At tries to enforce a fragile treaty.   Hao-Te Zui's Anarchists fight for the townsfolk that E.B Farnum's consortium of Entrepreneurs are trying to drive out of business.

And out in the Badlands, Ursula's cult prepares to summon the power of the great Worm.&#10;&#10;Doomtown: Weird West Edition is a poker-driven, territory control card game, updated from (and fully compatible with) the 2014 release of Doomtown: Reloaded, which was based on the 1998 Origins Awards Best Trading Card Game, Deadlands: Doomtown by Alderac Entertainment Group!&#10;&#10;All aspects of the game that require randomization are controlled via a poker mechanism as every card has a suit and value. Preparing for the hands you want to draw is as much a part of deck building as choosing the actions and dudes you'll want to play. Your deck is built around an Outfit, one of the six main groups attempting to control Deadwood.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved via poker hands.  Deciding who goes first  is decided by drawing the top five cards from your deck and the lowest poker hands go first.&#10;&#10;Players take one action each, in turn which can include:&#10;&#10;     Hiring a new dude (getting you influence in town)&#10;     Purchasing a new deed (getting you control in town)&#10;     Shopping for gear for your dudes&#10;     Start a shootout with your opponents to try to remove their influence.&#10;&#10;&#10;When each player passes, you reach &quot;Sundown&quot; for the day.

The ghost hunters must try to determine where the ghosts are hiding based upon the tiles destroyed. While doing this, though, the ghost hunters will also remove tiles &ndash; thus destroying them and adding to the total damage &ndash; to see whether a ghost is hidden beneath.&#10;&#10;The ghost hunters must think carefully and logically over which tiles to remove while the ghosts have to use cunning and psychology in order to cloud their investigation and remain concealed.

    "Description": "The Battle of Corinth simulates the battle that occurred on 3-4 October 1862 near Corinth, a Mississippi town just south of the Tennessee border. The town was a vital cross-link for the two main Southern railroads: the Mobile and Ohio (the north-south line) and the Memphis and Charleston (the east-west line) railroads. The Union had captured Corinth shortly after the Battle of Shiloh, and Confederate General Earl Van Dorn was ordered to keep the Union troops tied down while General Braxton Bragg struck into Kentucky.&#10;&#10;Van Dorn, his reputation damaged at Pea Ridge the previous spring, planned to hurl his 20,000 man army at an equal number of Federals who who held Corinth. Using a circuitous route to successfully confuse Union General William S. Rosecrans, Van Dorn marched on the town under the blazing hot sun of an Indian Summer. After two days of vicious fighting, in which they managed to take part of the town, the Confederate forces were forced to withdraw under the onslaught of the emplaced Union guns and Rosecrans&rsquo; fresh troops. Corinth marked the effective end of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi and brought about the unsuccessful court-martial of Van Dorn.&#10;&#10;Each Game-Turn represents 30 minutes of real time, and each hex covers about 135 yards from hexside to hexside. Each Strength Point is the equivalent of 100 men or 1 gun.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Corinth is Volume 6 from the Great Battles of the American Civil War series. Each game in the series uses a set of standard rules, which cover melee attack, small-arms and artillery fire, cavalry charges, and the effects of leadership.  Each game has a 16-page booklet of exclusive rules to cover the unique features of each battle and an historical article about each event. The game includes 400 counters and one 22&quot; x 34&quot; map.&#10;&#10;Published with Jackson at the Crossroads: Cross Keys & Port Republic, June 8-9, 1862.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Cartagena, Colombia, the doors speak. Not with words, but with the grandiose knockers that adorn them. In Spanish colonial times, the knockers announced your job and your social status with the design and detail. Lions, lizards, sea creatures, and hands proclaimed the homes' occupants as soldiers, nobles, fishermen, and clergy.&#10;&#10;Aldabas is a puzzley tableau-builder in which you you seek to fill your neighborhood with the most influential citizens. On each turn, players will take actions to build their neighborhood or increase their wealth. Clever placement will unlock bonuses, but only if you build in the right way.&#10;&#10;Those who keep the best company (and the fullest coffers) will surely be held in highest regard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mob Ties(TM) is a board game of negotiation, intrigue and revenge for three to six players playable in 90 - 120 minutes. During the course of the game, players assume the roles of mob bosses vying for control of a small city. Moving the members of their families between various locations on the game board, players attempt to collect cash and intimidate or work with other players&rsquo; family members to gain respect and protect their assets.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt favor cards at the beginning of the game that include attack cards, defense cards, weapon cards and specialty cards. Each turn during the action round, players may play any or all of the cards in their hand, attacking other players&rsquo; family members in locations where they also have family members, or defending their own game pieces from attacks.&#10;&#10;Each round, cards are drawn from the Fed Deck which determine how many and on what location Feds will be placed. If a location is surrounded by four or more Feds, the players must either defend themselves using weapons to remove one or more Feds, or vote for one among them to be pinched. If a player&rsquo;s game piece is pinched by the Feds, the game piece is placed in the Prison location on the game board.&#10;&#10;To win the game, players must successfully avoid the growing threat of the Feds and defend themselves from the encroachments of other mob families on their territories. As more family members are killed or pinched, the Heat Meter rises, eventually reaching its highest level and signaling the end of the game. Players then count their remaining game pieces and the cash they have accumulated during the course of the game and the player with the most money and respect wins.&#10;&#10;from the back of the box&#10;&#10;The pigs sound hungry. Above the oinks and the grunts you can hear your Associate screaming in the other room.  The Don's men have been working him over for a while now, but he hasn't given up any names.  The crisp crack of their knuckles across his face, again and again, a steady brutal rhythm, soon softens to a chorus of wet bloody thuds.  Screaming gives way to begging.  The sudden gunshot, a solitary flash under the door, startles you.  They drag your Associate's body off towards the expectant herd of swine at the end of the hall.  Steady footsteps approach the room where you sit tied to a chair.  The Don's men have some questions for you, too.&#10;&#10;",
