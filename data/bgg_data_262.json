But it's not quite that simple as not all of the components have the right form &ndash; and players can try to use their construction workers on the lower floors to block out others.&#10;&#10;Players have 5 workers, and are dealt a hand of building tiles. The tiles, in combination with rivets which fit through holes in the center, create a 3-dimensional construction. The tiles have grids in various configurations, and some have a construction worker. On your turn, take 3 actions. Options include placing a worker, moving a worker up a level, or building = adding a tile to the construction (which must touch the tile on which one of that player's workers is standing); score points = 1 per girder touching a girder already built, +1 if worker on tile, doubled if the new tile is now the highest built. There are penalties if you drop tiles or worker tokens, but otherwise you generally alternate taking turns adding tiles to the building.&#10;&#10;The rivets are placed in an hole in the center of the tile and can be fitted to other tiles already in play. There are some (few) construction rules and the building will grow turn after turn. Where add tiles is an important decision but you also need a certain amount of precision and dexterity doing that because if you cause the fall of a worker (yours of opponent) you will loose points. Actually an important part of the game is placing your workers in a way that make much more difficult to opponents to add tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends prematurely if someone collapses the building; they lose, and whoever is furthest on the score track (after deducting points for tiles remaining in hand) wins the game. Otherwise, most points (after all tiles built) wins!&#10;&#10;",

The streets of that version are located in downtown Reykjav&iacute;k, and companies include Loftlei&eth;ir and Flugf&eacute;lag &Iacute;slands.&#10;&#10;Trivia: When the Swedish publisher Alga lost the rights to publish Monopoly in the Nordic countries in 1981, they briefly considered designing their own Monopoly clone in order to fill the vacuum, called Monet&auml;r. Concept drawings of that game look very much like Matador, with a circular track.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sicilianos takes us into Sicily during the 1930's. Already then, it was a fine art for the early Mafiosos to launder their ill-gotten gains. Just like today, this was done through 'legitimate' businesses like laundries, restaurants or antique shops. As players of this canny card game, we must take our dirty money and invest it in money-making small enterprises. To do this, we have the use of a powerful Familia.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, other clans have something against us being able to successfully found our enterprises. So, in this game, a legitimate business only comes into being after a hefty clan war. The player who manages to make the most 'clean' money is crowned the head mafioso. But if someone should manage to open one of each of the different business types, he is crowned prince of the island without a fight.&#10;&#10;",

Components include a cloth bag for storage, poker chips numbered 1-10, a pair of dice, an instruction card, and one pad of preprinted score sheets.  Play consists of three rounds of dice rolling and in which the ten numbered chips are placed in front of a player.  The player then rolls the dice and removes any chip or combination if chips from play that equal the total on the dice.  Repeat until no further chips can be removed.  That player scores the total of the number of chips that have not been removed.  Lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;This game is very similar to Shut the Box, with the following differences:&#10;- Any number of chips totaling the sum of the dice may be removed, not just one or two&#10;- The game is played to three rounds rather than to 45 points.&#10;&#10;",

Possible actions per round are determined by throwing 3 dice per player, then placing a chit of this player in the corresponding box. Once every player has rolled and placed his chits the actions are taken, starting with the 1 box up to the 6 box. For every chit in the box one appropriate action is taken by that player.&#10;&#10;1, 3 and 5 is a barbarian attack, 2 and 4 allows a player to attack, 6 is taxation.&#10;Attacks are resolved by throwing 3 dice, any double causes one hit and eliminates the defending piece, a triple allows for a barbarian breakthrough and eliminates another piece adjacent to the original defender. Taxation allows for a maximum of three coins taken from the board.&#10;&#10;",

You control a group of survivors, not just one ninja of the apocalypse. You control your team to try and take back as much of the city before the infection ends. &#10;Then you can reign as king over the post-apocalyptic city. So how do you do this?&#10;&#10;Each turn, each survivor has one action which can be spent on either &#10;&#10;    Moving &ndash; moving one hex &#10;    Reclaiming the building &ndash; Boarding up the windows so it is safe again and you can lay down your flag to claim your victory points &#10;    Searching rooms &ndash; Each building has a set number of rooms you can search. What will you find, supplies? Survivors? Or the dreaded 10 zombie card!&#10;    And if on a park (farm) tile, then you can farm &ndash; One survivor can choose to spend an action point to farm.&#10;&#10;&#10;Farming? I hear you ask, well in the game once you have reclaimed a park, it is used to produce food. You can spend food at the start of your turn to give 3 survivor 2 action points that turn making them &ldquo;well fed and ready for zombie carnage&rdquo; However you can actively farm a park tile, spending a survivors action point. &#10;This means that at the start of your next turn that farm produces 2 food instead of 1.&#10;&#10;Ending the game!&#10;&#10;The game can end in 4 ways: &#10;The research centre is reclaimed (the cure has been found and the outbreak is over) &#10;The military base is reclaimed (More guns than any one army could need, you are left with a city flooded with zombie soup) &#10;When a group of survivors has reclaimed and spends one turn actively farming 5 farms (who needs to worry about zombies when you have fresh veg and steak every day) &#10;Or finally if one player reaches 50 Victory points before any of the other conditions are met&#10;&#10;However it is the player with the most Victory points that reigns king. So be careful before you cure the infection.&#10;&#10;Victory Points&#10;&#10;So what is worth victory points: &#10;&#10;    Buildings - worth the number of victory points indicated by the yellow number in the top right corner. &#10;    Survivors &ndash; worth 1 victory point each &#10;    When the game ends every 2 supplies card is worth 1 Victory point&#10;&#10;&#10;What else can you use supplies for? &#10;Throughout the game you can trade in 2 of your supplies to give one survivor: &#10;&#10;    Armour &ndash; decrease an attackers dice roll by one &#10;    Weapon &ndash; Increase one of your attacking die rolls by one&#10;&#10;&#10;Or you can build a wall. A wall will stop zombies and must be destroyed by attacking survivors before they can pass.&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;&#10;Combat in Surviving is simple. Survivors attack first. You roll a die for each survivor. Each die roll of 4,5 or 6 kills a zombie. Then any zombies left roll a die each to attack the survivors. A zombie must roll a 5 or 6 to kill a survivor. &#10;Repeat until all zombies are dead or all survivors are dead or have run away.&#10;&#10;That is it. Simple rules so if someone hasn&rsquo;t played before they can jump in and within one or two goes they are as clued in as everyone.&#10;&#10;",

The challenge is carried out with cards; the player with the higher number wins and gets to place his pawn on top of the opponent&rsquo;s pawn. This is more difficult than it sounds, since you only have a limited number of cards and you have to consider carefully which cards to use. In the course of the game the pawns will form high stacks, which belong to the player whose pawn is on top. The winner is the player who has collected the most pawns!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Yundao is a reworking of Knizia&#039;s Fish Eat Fish. It's a similar case to Goldrausch/Wapi: the game has a new theme, new components, and newly developed ideas, so it's more than just a new edition. This time the underwater theme has been changed to Oriental palaces moving around and growing in height.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Wheel of Time CCG is based on the novels of the same name, penned by Robert Jordan, and later, Brandon Sanderson. One player takes the side of the light and the Dragon Reborn, while another takes the side of the shadow and the Forsaken, in a struggle for control of the Pattern, the ultimate fabric and destiny of the universe.&#10;&#10;Each player requires his or her own Hero or Villain deck to play. Each deck features a major character from the Wheel of Time book series. The light side player chooses a hero to play with while the shadow player uses a villain deck. Characters in the side of light include series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and the other characters of good found within the books. Characters for the shadow include dark friends, as well as Rahvin and the other chosen.&#10;&#10;The players attempt to sway the Pattern to their side and amass the might needed to defeat his or her opponent in the final Pattern challenge and win the game. Along the way players will engage in politics, marshaling of armies, magic, and intrigue in an effort to bring characters, troops, and entire kingdoms onto their side.&#10;&#10;The core of the Wheel of Time CCG involves rolling dice. Characters and troops, each have different stats corresponding to their skill in politics, intrigue, combat and the one power. These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.&#10;&#10;Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops. The attacking player attempts to roll swords in the in-game custom dice, while the defending player attempts to roll shields. Winning challenge cards grant advantages based on card text, while winning the Pattern challenge may place Pattern tokens toward the side of the victorious player.&#10;&#10;End game triggers upon both players having a total of twenty Pattern tokens, together with any neutral tokens generated during play. The game then proceeds to the final challenge, where the players fight for dominance, again rolling the dice generated by their characters and troops, but this time, adding their Pattern tokens toward their success rolls.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From fire to smartphone in less than an hour!&#10;&#10;S-Evolution is a unique combination of a classic card game &mdash; with tricks, colors and trump &mdash; and of a typical &quot;Eurogame&quot; of resources management and civilization. Each player has a deck of 24 cards, and in each of the six rounds, he draws a hand of four cards from this deck. Each player starts the game in Age 1 and adds the progress card of this age to his deck.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of a card phase, lasting 4-5 tricks among all the players, followed by an individual management phase. During the card phase, players try to (1) gather resources (which are on the cards) to pay for the needs of their civilization and to construct buildings, (2) avoid diasters, and (3) collect discoveries. However, the value of a player's cards are affected by which Age he occupies. In Ages 1 and 2, for example, his cards have no color, so they automatically lose to cards of players in Age 3 and above as those folks have discovered the awesome power of hue. What's more, in the primitive Age 1, you can't see the cards before you play them. That's how primitive you are! In Ages 5 and 6, a player can start using trump to beat out those in lower ages.&#10;&#10;The advantages in the card phase are balanced by the needs of your population, which is much greater in later ages. In each trick, each player collects one played card based on the value of their card played, and players then use the resources on these cards (food, tools and science) to satisfy the needs of their population, erect buildings (which supply additional resources), gain advantages (which can protect you from disasters or earn you victory points), or advance to the next Age of S-Evolution. Players score points each round depending on how well they meet the needs of their population, suffering penalties if they fail to do so.&#10;&#10;At the end of the sixth round, players score points for their sets of discoveries, and the player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game that is a favorite of the kids.&#10;&#10;This game must be assembled inside the game box. Once constructed, it presents a graveyard, with movement spaces, hedges that cannot be crossed, moving tombs, and a crypt containing a headless ghost. The ghost must be defeated in order to win.&#10;&#10;Each player has two character pawns--only one of which they may chose to move on each turn. They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved. This tomb movement alters the playing field by changing what some of the spaces on the game board represent. In this way, a player might land on a square that is safe, but after a tomb is shifted--they suddenly find that they are left &quot;paralyzed with fear.&quot;&#10;&#10;There is complete freedom of movement, except as stated above, and players cannot cross their own path. One of the special spaces is a &quot;Goosebumps&quot; space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.&#10;&#10;During the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a &quot;magic potion&quot; square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost. In order to do so, they first must have picked up a ring card. At the crypt, the player drops the skull down the chute--if it falls the right way, then the headless ghosts springs into the air and the player wins. If not, they can attempt to defeat the ghost on their next turn.&#10;&#10;",

Melds are of at least 3 good guy together, 3 bad guys together, or 3 of the same character and are obligatory if possible.  You can add to your own melds and do not have to discard in going out.  There are also some special cards, played as discards, to make it interesting:&#10;&#10;Road Block -- Reverse direction and take another turn&#10;Speed Trap -- Next player loses a turn&#10;Parking Ticket -- Next player draws 2, cannot meld or discard&#10;Hazzard County Clout -- Played in response to last 2 cards, reverses effects onto the original player.  No effect if simply discarded.&#10;Hogg Wild -- Next player draws four, cannot meld or discard.&#10;&#10;None of these special cards can be picked up from the discard pile except a Hazzard County Clout that has been discarded.  Scoring is the same as rummy, with a 50 point bonus for going out.  First player to 500 wins.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to find the car keys and gas, and then escape. Most preferably, escape without losing anyone. Each character has unique properties that help them and the entire team. For example, the police girl has a gun and she doesn&rsquo;t need to look for one in the house.&#10;&#10;A fight against zombies is simulated with a rotating arrow with a range of possible results, from a victory to fleeing the battlefield or suffering a wound. Weapons can modify the result.&#10;&#10;If a monster eats your character, you become a zombie chief. With your help, zombies can chase living characters, block their access to rooms or specific items.&#10;&#10;",

Thirty-five games featuring 1700 answers and questions about The Simpsons are included. You get the answers and have to give the questions. That's what they do on the real Jeopardy show. Yes, it includes both rounds of play -- Jeopardy and Double Jeopardy. And, yes, Daily Doubles, too.  But it's got more. Specially designed Simpsons art really makes the game board extra fun, and The Simpsons play money could never be mistaken for real bucks. So jump on the sofa and join the fun!&#10;&#10;",

When dropping to certain scores, you get advantages or disadvantages. The game is balanced so that players that are behind gain a bonus and the game stays balanced and interesting until the last turn.&#10;&#10;The last man standing is the Greatest Hypnotist of all and wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Be careful because at any time, if you have the Mirror card, you can steal the other players' turn and make them all draw!&#10;&#10;EKKO is a real party game. During the game, all players must pay attention to what is going on around the table. Indeed, a player can, at any time, play a Mirror card and thus steal his opponents' turn. The Mirror card of a card is the one whose numbers are reversed compared to this card. For example, 73 is the Mirror card of the card 37. Playing a Mirror card allows you either to make all players draw or to get rid of a card! There is also a strategic aspect to the game, because when it is your turn to play, you play a card according to what was played by the previous player. For example, if I place my 02 (on which is indicated the sign -), the next player will have to play less than 02, which is very unlikely since the cards go from 01 to 98, forcing him again to draw a card.&#10;&#10;",

These days not storks but steel cranes are characteristic features of Polish landscape. Building and structures are being erected everywhere. New ribbons of asphalt cut through the fields. Sleek spans of slender bridges join river banks. Ring roads encircle towns and cities. Multi-level junctions resemble gigantic works of abstract art. Polish engineers use state-of-the-art technology and heavy construction equipment. Local communities wholeheartedly support the development of transport infrastructure. An architect, a landscaper, a construction mech operator have become dream professions for a child and ideal occupations of a prospective son-in-law.&#10;Welcome to Poland! Soon, 100 years after Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski and Tadeusz Wenda the country on the Vistula will need you for the national construction effort.&#10;&#10;Under construction: Poland is a family board game, which with the subtle touch of irony and strong sensce of humor treats of building roads and highways in Poland. Players become managers, their goal is to finish all the contracted jobs faster than the opponents. Engineers, workers and dozens of very special machines are ready to start.&#10;&#10;During their turn players decide either they work in the office or on the building site.&#10;In the office players draw cards from the market and use special cards such as: Recruiter, Archaeologist, Supplier or Site Manager. Those cards make the game easier for the player, but harder for the opponents.&#10;On the building site players bulid infrastructure by discarding relevant cards and placing tokens on the map. They can also get rid of Arachaelogist or use special cards: Local Community or Employee of the Month. &#10;After finishing one of assigned contracts player gets 3 extra cards from the market.&#10;Whoever complete all of his/her contracts first is the winner of the game.&#10;The players have different number of contracts and infrastructures to be build, but the game is very well balanced.&#10;&#10;The biggest advantages of the game are illustrations and high quality of materials used for its production. The board consists of 16 elements, shaped with great likeness to the polish voivodships. The network of roads and highway reflects ambitious plans of national infrastructure. Last but not least, few dozens of tokens and over 150 beautifully painted cards makes this game a &ldquo;must have&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At first you think you are playing good old Monopoly where they just add some extra buildings to give a little twist. But the longer you play, the more you realise they actually made a whole new game. You start with more money than usual, which gives you the idea you will last longer (with a bit of luck maybe). The fact that now you can build right away when you bought a property, gives so much dynamic to the game. No more waiting until you have the whole set, or not having the set because one player refuses to trade. Even with a couple of single properties you can win the game.&#10;&#10;But not so fast. Everybody wants to win of course. And with the 80 extra buildings they added to the game, nothing was ever so uncertain. On every property you can build residential or industrial buildings. The first is not protected against negative buildings (hazards) and requires positive buildings otherwise the property becomes worthless. The industrial buildings on the other hand are protected but they cost twice as much! So you will have to make choice. And the added electronic device will, besides timing deals, always indicate how many buildings you can exactly make.&#10;&#10;There is also no community chest anymore, only chance. But they have changed the content of the cards which makes the game less predictable and more fun to play- watch your buildings being crushed because of an earthquake or not getting your rent because a player evades the number thrown with the dice.&#10;&#10;Besides these changes, there are many more twists to the game which I will not reveal here but be sure that they all add to the greatness that once was and that now has even become better.&#10;&#10;Monopoly City made its first public appearance at the Nuremberg Toy Fair 2009.&#10;&#10;",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is a new take on the collectible non-collectible KB line, with Jeffrey Neil Bellinger once again putting the rabbits through the grinder. Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.&#10;&#10;When the insatiable appetite of Killer Bunnies game fans demanded more, Playroom looked to Killer Bunnies creator and game designer Jeffrey Neil Bellinger to coordinate the development of, like other games in the Killer Bunnies family, a non-collectible game that can offer variations through different color nick-named deck options. However, this time a new desire expressed by the huge Killer Bunnies fan-base has been fulfilled: Killer Bunnies now has a constructable game variation. Though still not collectible or random, players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey  six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.&#10;&#10;The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.&#10;&#10;Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is the latest in the family of Killer Bunnies games which features, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Remix, Kinder Bunnies: Their First Adventure and Killer Bunnies and the Journey to Jupiter.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to individual starter decks (A-decks) and expansion decks (B-, C-, D- and E-decks), the following products are offered.  Each of the combination decks come with a promo card for each deck included.&#10;&#10;     Heroic and Azoic (Violet, Red, and Blue A-decks)&#10;     Lively and Spry (Green, Orange, and Yellow A-decks)&#10;     Elementals vs. Animals (Violet and Orange A- and B-decks)&#10;     Energy vs. Crops (Red and Green A- and C-decks)&#10;     Technology vs. Land (Blue and Yellow A- and D-decks)&#10;&#10;&#10;Killer Bunnies: Heroes vs. Villains &#226;&#128;&#147; Blue Starter Deck includes (in fact, consists of) the Blue, Green, and Yellow E-decks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "How many of you remember the old videogames of the '80s &ndash; '90s where you had to be extremely skilled in cabinet to strip completely super-pixelled girls?&#10;&#10;Oppai Go has been created from this idea, a &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; game in which each player has a sexy female alter ego taken on a desert island as a sort of &ldquo;Battle Royale&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Hunger Games&rdquo;, with the exception of only wearing underwear. Unfortunately the fate is not by your side (or maybe yes?), because you will be &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to use every means at your disposal to fully undress your opponents and try to earn your way back home.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).&#10;&#10;The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:&#10;1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side&#10;2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)&#10;3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)&#10;4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)&#10;5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)&#10;&#10;The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.&#10;&#10;Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.&#10;&#10;The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.&#10;&#10;The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.&#10;&#10;This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.&#10;&#10;",

It is easy to learn and fun for the whole family! Each player is dealt 5 cards and the remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to be used as the draw pile. Players should maintain 5 cards in their hand at all times until they hit &ldquo;Top Speed.&rdquo; Players do this by drawing after each turn. At the end of their turn, players must call out their current speed. To start the game, players place a card from their hand on the playing surface in front of them, face up. This is the &ldquo;Speed Pile.&rdquo; Players have their own active speed piles they are trying to increase to 200MPH. Players track their speed using their &ldquo;Speed-O-Meter&rdquo; by adjusting the wheel at the end of each turn. This process is repeated until someone reaches &ldquo;Top Speed,&rdquo; but players must try to avoid the Blow Out, Caution, and Pit Stop cards along the way! Start your engines, you are ready to play!&#10;&#10;",
