What makes it remarkable is that the board has a downhill racing track on it, which makes it quite unique.&#10;&#10;This game was included the game compilation &quot;Juegos Reunidos&quot; (usual Spanish denomination for games' combination boxes). Corominas released a series of boxes in 1962. The smaller one was of just 5 games, the bigger one of as many as 40 games. In some of the boxes was included this simple cycling game called &quot;Bajando el Puerto&quot;, &quot;En descendant le port&quot;, &quot;Walking Down The Port&quot;. The rules were trilingual, really strange in Spain at the time. The game is remarkable for its graphics, and also because it is the only game I know that represents a downhill race.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a traditional native American dice game, played exclusively by men. It is also a board game, with the board created on the ground using stones and sticks as markers and pieces. Forty stones are placed in a circle to form the track; players use a stick as their marker (or horse). Players cast three wooden billets, known as Pa-tol sticks, onto a flat stone; how they fall indicates how far their piece can move. Landing on another player's piece sends it back to its start. Players may choose where they wish to enter their piece and can choose to go round the track in either direction. The winner is the first player whose marker completes a circuit of the track.&#10;&#10;While ostensibly a game of chance, descriptions of the game claim that expert players can throw the sticks to get their desired results.&#10;&#10;Rules and more information are available here:&#10;http://www.scienceviews.com/indian/indiangames11.html&#10;&#10;",

Based on the short lived eponymous 1974 television series.&#10;&#10;Object of game: The Apple family likes to do things together and in this game, the players have fun matching cards of their many activities. As players move around the path of the board, they try to stop on certain squares so they can pick up a green card that would show some activity that would match a yellow card in their hand. When a player has matched a green card from the board with a yellow card from their hand, both cards are discarded and out of the game. Green and yellow are common apple colors, after all!&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the first player to discard all of his cards.&#10;&#10;",

The board contains spaces with numbers, as well as spaces without numbers.  Players place their pawns on a non-numbered spot to begin the game.  A card is drawn showing a number that corresponds to one of the numbered spots on the board.  Players take turns attempting to land on that spot. How many spots a player moves on his/her turn is determined by a spinner.  Whichever player lands on the spot first collects the card.&#10;&#10;Another card is drawn, and the same routine continues until all cards are distributed and the winner is the player with the most cards.&#10;&#10;",

There are also a number of (initially) neutral minor powers countries such as Spain, Belgium, Ireland etc etc. Each country has two key properties: Military strength and Political strength. The territory held and political points value of a country determine its military strength.&#10;&#10;One of the key features to the game is ability to influence a minor power using your political points. If enough are used then there is a chance the minor power will be come friendly (allowing passage through their territory) or even allied (allowing use of their military).&#10;&#10;Like Diplomacy, orders are written down and executed simultaneously. In 1930! the orders include everything from movement to application of political power. Conflicts that arise are resolved according the combat strength of the forces involved with a simple percentage roll. In between turns it's time to make and break alliances with the other major power players.&#10;&#10;From the game designer:&#10;&#10;'1930! is my attempt to produce a game that retains a set of simple rules and the personal interaction found with Diplomacy, but extends the game play to include aircraft, the political or economic power of countries and many more neutral countries.

You may fly with wingmen and elements that are randomly generated based on your current command and trust ranks - the better and more trusted you become, the better pilots will fly with you!&#10;&#10;The player will create their alter-ego pilot from a detailed pilot-creation system, and through involved tactical battles featuring variable, cunning enemy bogeys, detailed integrated air defense modeling, random ground targets, and the freedom of choosing from over 24 different actions per game 'impulse', you will make the tactical decisions that affect each turn. With limited help from AWACS, you must uncover the battlefield - detect initially unknown 'blips', track, lock and destroy hostile air and ground targets - before they detect and kill you!&#10;&#10;No two battles, missions, or encounters are ever the same. Luck is a factor, as in the real battlefield, but skill and sound tactical decisions will always take precedence in the end of Falcon Ace.&#10;&#10;Will your pilot change the face of the war... or even live to see the end of it?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Backgammon enthusiasts should feel at home with Starz, in which players maneuver pieces around a board according to dice throws, attempting to land on various &quot;power beads.&quot; When different beads are added to a piece's spire (which is made of flexible plastic, but still is something to keep away from children), it gains the abilities to move onto red and blue squares, to move diagonally, and to land on opposing pieces.  Since a piece acquires the power beads of any opposing piece it captures, everyone has plenty of incentive to play aggressively, even in a four player game.&#10;&#10;(Description from Nov. 1984 GAMES Magazine, p. 36, with minor correction--the original read &quot;added to the board's spire,&quot; rather than &quot;added to a piece's spire,&quot; but the former is clearly incorrect, judging from the picture which accompanies the game description in the magazine; &quot;a piece gains the abilities&quot; was then changed to &quot;it gains the abilities.&quot;)&#10;&#10;",

They escaped the posse by the separating, each going to his own &ldquo;hideout&rdquo;.  Later they came out to recover the &ldquo;loot&rdquo;.  In this game, the players are members of the Jesse gang who come from their Hideouts, to ravel around the road, pick up the Saddlebags and carry them back to their Hideouts.  They compete with each other in gathering the most Loot.  They even try to steal a Saddlebag from their opponents by means of a gunfight.  The bags may change hand several times as the outlaws continually circle the board trying to get their Loot safely into their Hideouts.  The one getting the most Loot into his Hideout wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The players decide on the number of horses that will be used for the game (8 is a good number). At the beginning of the game, each player takes turns dropping one of those horses onto an empty cell.&#10;&#10;On each turn, each player moves all of the horses (which move like chess knights but one player must move them west-west-north/south and the other player move them north-north-west/east). When a horse enters inside the barn it is removed from play. More than one horse can occupy a space at a time. If a player cannot move some horse on their turn, that player loses.&#10;&#10;Diverse variants exist, e.g. impartial (all 4 possible moves for a horse are available to both players), misere play (the first player who cannot move a horse on their turn wins), etc.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes turns placing one of his stones on the intersections of the grid (only the center 12&times;12 grid on the go board is used.) Your goal is to recreate the web pattern on your card by placing your stones on the board. Once a stone is placed, it cannot be moved. It is possible that the webs two players wish to create will overlap, in which case it becomes a race to see who can capture those intersections first. Points are scored based on whether the stone placed is in alignment with your web or one of your opponent's web, with more points being scored for stones that are placed in alignment with your web.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players have used all their stones. The winner is whoever gets the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Strategy: Smuggling &amp; Smuggler Catching: Long Haul Trucking&#10;&#10;Players make money by delivering goods throughout the U.S. and certain overseas cities.  There are two ways to make money: 1) make a successful delivery and 2) intercept an illegal delivery.  Players can choose whether to attempt to make legal or illegal deliveries.  Illegal deliveries have higher payouts.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase boats, weigh stations, and upgrades for trucks in order to increase their chances of making deliveries or checking other players' deliveries.  But don't get too carried away, because all assets count as $0 at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to catch a Smuggler?  Are you the Smuggler?  Either way, this will be an action-packed, fun game!&#10;&#10;",

After all atoms are placed they form one large molecule, which may split into several smaller molecules during the game.&#10;&#10;Each atom has a valence, which is the number of atoms (of either color) adjacent to it (include diagonal). Players must now move one of their atoms to any adjacent empty cell provided that its valence in the new position is exactly the same as its valence in the old position.&#10;&#10;Any atom which is not adjacent to an enemy atom is unstable. Immediately after each move, the players remove all unstable atoms from the board. This also occurs after Black makes his last drop.&#10;&#10;A player wins by stalemating his opponent, (leaving him with no legal moves). A player also wins by leaving an empty board (after the removal operation); in fact this is a special case of stalemate since his opponent would have no moves at all.&#10;&#10;R. Kraus defined two variants: Isotopes, where each atom can move any number of cells (instead of just being able to move to the adjacent cell); and Radioactive Atoms, where a stone may also commit suicide (if able to move to an isolated cell)&#10;&#10;",

This means that the moving stone can move to an empty cell which is orthogonally adjacent to the gravity center. This implies that isolated stones cannot move. Orbits are multiple, after one orbit, the moving stone can continue to move, if the direction of the orbit is smooth (e.g., if it began clockwise, it must continue counterclockwise, and so on...)&#10;&#10;Another moving possibility is that if there is a 3rd planet in front of a possible orbit, the orbiting stone can move to its place and push that stone to the immediate next empty cell (in the same direction of the orbit). If that next immediate cell is not empty, the gravity push is not possible.&#10;&#10;The first player that moves all of his stones into the initial adversary setup wins.&#10;&#10;",

With more ships, bookkeeping becomes a problem. With less, strategic elements are minimized.&#10;&#10;Attack Vector is designed as a tabletop game. These rules assume you will be using measuring tapes as the only point of reference. However, if you would like to use a hex map, the same rules can be used.&#10;&#10;",
