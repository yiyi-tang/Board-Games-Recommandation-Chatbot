But before you can get to the glamorous part, it's time for some good old-fashioned HR.&#10;&#10;In LFG: Looking For Group, you're trying to build an adventuring party by gathering heroes with different aptitudes and convincing them to work together! Or, you could just recruit all the shadiest scoundrels in the land.&#10;&#10;LFG is a game of drafting; choosing resources turn by turn. Each round, you will choose one Hero from your hand to join your party. Then, you'll pass your hand to the next player. However, Heroes can use their abilities to mess with rival parties. Using them wisely will make the difference between assembling a winning team, and a dysfunctional mess!&#10;&#10;",

And they try to collect as many votes as possible until some one finds the voting token and manages to get it back to Helsinki.&#10;&#10;When moving around the map, players turn around tokens from which they either get or lose votes.&#10;&#10;When the voting token is returned to Helsinki, everyone counts their votes and who ever has the most is the winner.&#10;&#10;The second game Ministeri Mylly is basically Trouble (Kimble), but with a twist.&#10;&#10;Each player has two pieces. Pieces are moved on a round track by trowing a dice. Players try to get their peaces around the board. When they do they become ministers, and are moved to ministry. From there they might be forced to go to European Parliament.&#10;&#10;The player that has the prime minister or otherwise highest ranking ministers is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Prime Number Lv.0 is a re-implementation of &#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170; (Prime Daifugo) with changes made for easier play and for the incorporation of hand management during the game.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the deck, then deal ten cards to each player. The leader plays any prime number from a combination of 1-3 cards (see below), then in clockwise order, players may pass or play a larger prime number than the most recently played prime using the same number of cards as the leader. (A player can optionally draw a card from the deck prior to playing.) The round continues until no player wants to play. The last player who played a valid number leads the next round. If you get rid of all cards in your hand, you win the round and whoever first wins two rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;To play a prime number, take 1-3 cards from your hand and arrange them to create a single number by using all the digits on those cards. If the number is prime, your play is valid. For example, if playing &quot;3&quot; and &quot;5&quot;, you may arrange their order and play them only as &quot;53&quot; because &quot;35&quot; is not a prime number. To play three cards, all of the cards must have single digits on them (so you can't use &quot;10&quot; or &quot;12&quot;) and at least one of the cards must feature a &quot;play three&quot; icon.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#153;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#230;&#166;&#130;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;10&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#230;&#133;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#

Instead of paying for merchandise cards, players can lock their pawns on cards until the price is payed. Each transaction requires shipment - players can build their own transport route, or simply pay other players to use their carriage.&#10;&#10;Game ends after 5 to 8 rounds and player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;During the game players can learn words from Wymysi&ouml;ery&#197;&#155; language and see traditional Wilamowiceans' outfit.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "These rules describe an often overlooked period of warfare known as the Wars of the Orcses, a civil war between competing factions in the northern regions of Orcland. The war was fought between two rival branches of the House of Plantagut: the House of Lank-Pasta, associated with the emblem of the red rose growing out of the skull of a dead Angry-Vin Goblin &ndash; and the House of Yorc whose symbol was the white rose (growing out of the arse of a dead Stu-Wart Goblin). The wars lasted for over thirty years with many epic battles fought including the Battles of Stained Albans, Pewksebery and many many more. The struggle swung back and forth with first one faction in the ascendancy and then the other. The heavy loss of Orc life was both widespread and tragic &ndash; and neighbouring powers looked on with interest as Orcland seemed to tear itself apart. Eventually the war ended at the decisive Battle of Bogsworth Field and the crowning of the warlord Hen-Wee as king Hen-Wee VII. The kings position was further strengthened when Hen-Wee married Elibarf of Yorc, the daughter of Edturd IV, the most prominent Yorcist claimant to the throne of Orcland.&#10;&#10;The Wars of the Orcses rules allow players to fight large scale battles between rival Orc armies with lots of supporting allied and mercenary units of Goblins, Hobgoblins, Trolls and Ogres. The rules included a detailed background to the conflict, the key players and a list of the major battles fought. Also included is a scenario describing the Battle of Pewksbery. If you fancy a bit of Orc on Orc action you probably need help &ndash; but either way these are the rules for you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It was the end of the Second World War, however, Germans were not eager to surrender, especially to the Poles. They defended each of their positions fiercely, often using mines and traps. But the determined attack of the Polish soldiers freed Bologna, ending the combat trail of the Polish forces in Italy.&#10;&#10;This game uses Taktyka i Strategia's 2nd World War &quot;WB95&quot; system.

Your band of adventurers teleports to his treasure to claim it, but you must evade traps and battle monsters to escape. Just when you think you have reached the exit, Firethrax returns to stop you! Which adventurer among you will defeat the dragon to claim victory?&#10;&#10;Dice &amp; Danger: Dragon's Lair is a board game designed to introduce younger children to the basic concepts of fantasy role-playing games. It is a simple race game in which players try to be the first to defeat the dragon at the last space on the board. Players take on the roles of various fantasy characters and start the game with three treasure cards, which allow them to perform actions or add to their combat die roll. A ten-sided die determines movement and combat. The spaces on the board are either free spaces or encounter spaces. The encounter spaces can be traps, monsters, or the single Holy Fountain treasure space. The monsters become progressively more difficult to defeat along the track, culminating in Firethrax the dragon. Defeating a monster rewards the player with a new treasure card, but losing to a monster means losing the next turn. The first player to defeat Firethrax wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The world of Sword &amp; Sorcery is imbued with many mystical secrets, and familiars are but one of these! In this set players can find five intelligent little creatures that are able to create a magical link with their humanoid friends.&#10;&#10;The ancient scrolls of the Archmagi classify Lawful familiars into three types, each characterized by a deep bond with their owner: Domestic (Dog); Wild (Boar, Horned Lizard, Owl); Legendary (Pixie).&#10;&#10;Each of these Familiars provides valuable help on the battlefield or grants peculiar abilities to its owner, such as the superior sense of smell of a Dog or mystic enchantments of a Pixie. But this deep bond has a downside. When a Familiar dies, its owner suffers a terrible mental shock, which hampers their skills for a time.&#10;&#10;This expansion can be used with any Sword &amp; Sorcery Quest or Campaign (Immortal Souls or Ancient Chronicles), by simply shuffling the Familiar cards into the Treasure deck.&#10;&#10;",

The game expands to actually landing on the Moon depending on your revealed mission. This can even result in an Apollo 8, 10 or 13 mission, which has other missions than landing due to the historic situation. In this game both inclination and altitude are combined with maneuvering and economic fuel usage. A way back to Earth is required to finish the game. The winner in this expansion has the most point, based on efficient maneuvering and a fast return after mission execution.

Drones are rarely used&#226;&#128;&#168;.&#10;&#10;3. Extended Game 90-120min&#10;Adults and kids 12yrs+, play until all nectar &amp; pollen taken from board.&#10;Much more strategic, drones are used extensively to steal from each others hives&#10;&#10;A aesthetically pleasing game which focuses on touch and feel, with wooden hexagon laser-cut tiles, printed cotton cloth for the board and unique clay bees.&#10;&#10;Rules closely mimic how a bee colony actually works and players naturally learn bee &lsquo;rules&rsquo; such as how far bees will forage (5km), using the waggle dance to tell other bees where the best nectar is located (waggle wheel spinner), and rob weaker hives in autumn (hero or hazard cards).&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to avoid any of the characters in the game losing all their defenses, and to do this you will have different preventive measures and medications... which are not always enough.&#10;&#10;The game has 3 types of cards: character cards, attack cards (pathogens, &quot;out of stock&quot; cards and antimicrobial resistance cards) and defense cards (prevention measures and medications)&#10;At the start of the game, 5 characters are chosen at random and placed in the center of the table. Each character has some defense points and an innate prevention measure.&#10;&#10;The game consists in using the defense cards in order to stop the characters from losing their defense points due to the effects of the pathogen cards. Everyone plays at the same time, with no turns or player order. The pathogens are defeated through player cooperation. The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round includes the following phases: exposure (to pathogens); prevention and treatment; infection and contagion. If a character reaches zero defense points, the players lose the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The deck can be used as normal playing cards from 2 to ace + jokers. But also as a Japanese Hanafuda deck (48 cards + 6 jokers). The cards can be used playing Trumps, Dingo, Old Maid and other games also.&#10;&#10;You can also battle with the characters. Pick five random cards each and do not show your opponent. The rest of the cards is placed in a &ldquo;dice pile&rdquo;. The player who most recently was in a fight (for real!) start. It might be back in preschool? Pick one of your characters and decide if you want to do a physical attack; the sword or a mental attack; the candle. Sword attacks are obviously defended by the shield and candle attacks are defended by the smiley face; humour.&#10;&#10;The opponent picks out a character he thinks can defend without knowing the attacking value. Now both player draws a card from the dice pile and add the eyes on the card's die to their value, starting with the attacker. Highest total wins and is placed in front of the winner as a used character that won the battle. Also place the die card under it, it's the price for winning; a new recruit. The defeated character is placed in bottom of the dice pile (face up) and the die card (face down).&#10;&#10;For example: player one (Kajsa) gets Lonar, Cadran, Minx, Dag and Moog. She chooses Lonar, one of the most powerful characters in the game and attacks with brains/candle (value 8). Player two (Kalle) chooses to defend with his character with highest humour, but that is still only Silver (5). Kajsa takes the first card in the dice pile which is Ulg. Ulg has however only 1 eye on his T6. 8 + 1 = 9 in mental attack. Kalle draws the next card and gets Donolen who has 5 eyes on the T6. 5 + 5 = 10. Silver wins and is placed in front of Kalle along with Donolen. They are now battle weary and not available until everybody have fought. Kajsa's Lonar is discarded under the dice pile along with Ulg. But defeated cards like Lonar can return as an undead and is placed face up! Ulg is placed face down like all other cards. Kalle wins the battle and starts the next round.&#10;&#10;If the numbers are even the result is a tie, place both characters in front of the players, they are also battle weary and not available. However the dice cards are discarded and not won. Continue battling until all characters have fought. If both players have character cards left after everybody has fought, pick them up again and repeat everything. Shuffle the dice pile again and remember to keep the undead face up. The one with the least cards start the next battle. If even use rock-papers-scissors to decide. If an undead gets into your army keep it upside down on your hand. When played it automatically defeats both the opponent and him/herself. Remove the undead from the game after battle. The loser is the player who lost all of his/her cards. If one player has more characters to play than the other those are rested until next round.&#10;&#10;Try adding rules like that darker cards have +1 against lighter cards or that same silhouettes can&rsquo;t fight each other for example.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!&#10;&#10;WIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW: In Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.&#10;&#10;Based on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.&#10;&#10;As a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!&#10;&#10;After you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.&#10;After you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.&#10;&#10;Note: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.&#10;&#10;If you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;As a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MAMAEV KURGAN, STALINGRAD, RUSSIA, 27 September 1942: Acknowledging the damage done to his army in assaulting the southern and central sections of the city, General von Paulus had systematically reconfigured his forces for a fresh assault. Two shock groups were formed, with one consisting primarily of the 100th J&auml;ger Division, whose task was to clear and control Mamaev Kurgan, followed by an advance into the Tennis Racket and the Bannyi Ravine and finally to occupy the Krasnyi Oktiabr workers' settlements. Paulus' counterpart, General Chuikov was well aware of these preparations and had planned appropriate spoiling attacks, though he was unaware of the fresh German reinforcements. His attack was disrupted before it could even begin, with waves of Stukas strafing his advancing forces. His strongpoint on the crest of the burial mound was destroyed. Bombs and artillery cut down the attackers, decimating their ranks and allowing the following German advance to gain ground. The j&auml;gers advanced two regiments abreast and captured the western slopes, but initially failed to take the southern slopes. The 227th J&auml;ger Regiment's vigorous assaults, supported by intense artillery, destroyed the Russian ability to hold on. The Germans would secure the summit that evening (though some bypassed remnants would harass the Germans on the southern and western slopes for the next few days). By day's end, the 95th Division retained a foothold on the northern and eastern slopes of the burial mound, but was down to only 400 effective fighting men.&#10;&#10;This is the Advanced Tobruk System treatment of this bloody battle which includes a large-hex map on heavy cardstock panels, new overhead (OVR) infantry and light weapons counters and the usual set of scenarios, Battlefield Walkaround document and AFV cards.&#10;Ownership of ATS Rules, playaids, system markers and a &quot;standard&quot; Russian/German sheet of AFV counters are required to make use of this product.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Yet the desperate fight for Heraklion had everything: street-fighting in the town; heroic attacks against well-fortified positions and medieval walls; heavy losses on all sides&hellip;&quot;&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;- Six 11x16&quot; map panels depicting the Heraklion airfield and surrounding area&#10;- Five half-sheets of counters providing all of the combat counters required&#10;- Eight new scenarios&#10;- Battlefield Walkaround&#10;- One AFV card (British Matilda II)&#10;&#10;Players are required to have the ATS Rules, playaids and generic system markers to make full use of this product.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Three cards with pictures on them are dealt. You pick one card and write down the name of what's written on the card, then everyone reveals what they wrote at once. If you gave the same answer as someone else you get points. It sounds simple but it's surprisingly difficult!&#10;&#10;For example, if you see brown liquid in a cup with steam coming off it, is that coffee, tea, cocoa, or something else?&#10;&#10;There are also further complications. You get extra points for matching the dealer most of the time, so you have to think about what they'll write. If all the background colors match, matching the dealer doesn't give you an advantage, but all points are tripled! Some cards have a star on them that means points are doubled, but they might be harder to give a single name to than the other cards...&#10;&#10;The rules are in Japanese and many of the cards are chosen with relevance to Japanese culture or language, but you don't need to read or understand Japanese to use them. (Example: there is a picture of a snail. This has only one obvious name in English, but in Japanese there are a number of words for snail varying by region.)&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Road Trip is a spin and move game with a modular board.  It was originally a giveaway at McDonald's restaurants.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 20 punch out paper tiles printed with road patterns.  Players arrange the tiles to create a town, then spin the paper spinner to move their paper cars around the board, trying to make it from start to finish.  The spinner determines the direction of movement rather than the distance.  All moves are one square.  Spins may also move players to one of two traffic circles or allow movement of another player's piece.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
