    "Description": "The Lord of the Rings Board Game is a roll and move parody board game for fans of Lord of the Rings, not to be mistaken for the Reiner Knizia game (or any of the many other Lord of the Rings games).&#10;&#10;Players have six tasks from the book that they strive to accomplish (on their handy &quot;Things to Do&quot; check sheets). Players begin in Rivendell, visit Moria, Edoras, Isengard, Erech, Pelargir, Minas Tirith and Mount Doom to complete their tasks, then return to the Shire. Each task requires a successful die roll to complete and players draw &quot;Plot Complication&quot; cards that can make things easier, harder or much harder. Along the way, there are other locations that require players to draw plot complications.&#10;&#10;The game is freely available on the Tolkien Sarcasm website (http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/tolksarc.htm), a Tolkien humor website. It has its own special page: http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/boardgame/lotrgame.htm. To create the game, a fair amount of publishing work is required, as the cards and board are not presented in printer-ready form.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/boardgame/lotrgame.htm&#10;&#10;",

Each player has 24 square shaped walls that can be placed throughout the dungeon to block the other player from reaching the Dragon Lord.  At the beginning of the game, the players share the starting location and the location of the DragonLord in their respective dungeons.&#10;&#10;The game play mechanics are very similar to &quot;Battleship&quot; in that the dungeon is laid out in a grid (rows and columns) and each player takes turns shouting out a location in the grid which will reveal a clear path or a wall.  The winner is the first player to successfully navigate to the DragonLord of their opponent's dungeon.&#10;&#10;The advanced rules include monster pieces; treasure chests, combat, and cards with text on them that make the game play more immersive.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The name of the game is derived from the fairy-tale Sleeping Beauty (&quot;Dornr&ouml;schen&quot; in German) which is well known in many parts of Europe, including Germany and Russia. Although the game may appear superficially as a variant of Anglo-American Checkers, it has many unusual features that are not known in any other Checkers game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Men capture adjacent enemy ladies (the equivalent of kings in Checkers) by the short leap backwards, but never forwards. However, adjacent enemy men are captured by them in the usual way by leaping forwards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     If a man reaches the opponent's back rank, he is promoted to a sleeping beauty (and turned upside down), if the player has already a lady. A player can never have two or more ladies at the same time. Sleeping beauties are inactive until they are woken up.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A lady captures by the short leap like the king in English Draughts / American Straight Checker. A lady can also capture in the Chess way by replacement like a Ferz in Shatranj, not just by jumping.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     It is not permitted to combine both ways of capturing in one move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Capturing by replacement is not compulsory, whereas capturing by jumping is and the greatest number possible must be captured. Consequently, jumping always takes precedence over replacement, unless a lady can capture the opponent's lady. Then the lady that captures has the choice between both ways of capturing, which is called Royal Privilege&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A sleeping beauty may not move or capture, nor may she be captured. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     After a sleeping beauty is woken up, she is permitted to make a &quot;jump of joy&quot;, a rule that was was inspired by the Kurierspiel. However, a jump of joy is only permitted if the square crossed over is (1) vacant and (2) not &quot;threatened&quot; (or &quot;guarded&quot; in Chess terminology).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The object of the game is to leave the opponent without a valid move, either by capturing all his pieces, or by blocking them completely.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A game can never end in a draw, thus &quot;vanquishing the curse of the Checkers draw&quot; as Kerry Handscomb, the editor of the Abstract Games magazine put it. There are, however, rare positions very similar to jishogi, or impasse in Japanese Chess that need a special rule: In a continous sequence of moves in which only ladies are moved, a particular lady is not permitted to move onto the same square twice after the full board position has been repeated once (even if the lady occupied this square before the position was repeated).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A point scoring system is used to determine the margin of win. The winner gets as many points as there are still pieces on the board (of any kind and color). The loser gets zero points, even if he has still pieces left (in the case of a blockade).&#10;&#10;&#10;The game has been extensively covered in the Abstract Games magazine whose Canadian editors described it as &quot;fascinating&quot; and &quot;rather strange&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Assemble your army from a huge variety of nations and factions available. Collect and play gods, minions, enhance your troops with artefacts &amp; equipment and unleash powerful spells, command mighty beasts, towering war-machines and unique personalities.

The 4 x 4 grid is randomly created at the beginning of the game and the tiles can also have the 'action' or 'passengers' attribute on them as well as the track.  Players move by rolling a die and moving around the tiles following the arrows and only on track that can connect, if they end on an 'action' tile then they take an action card, if they end on a 'passenger' tile then they collect 3 passengers.  The next player then continues to play from the position of the last player&#10;&#10;The action tile cards have different effects such as flipping the tiles over to the other side, making the player lose all their passengers, moving them to the bottom of the board, or cause them to end their turn.&#10;&#10;The game continues until either a player decides to end the game, this gives the other players 2 turns to get additional passengers or the game ends when there are no more passenger cards left.  In both situations the player with the most passengers wins.&#10;&#10;The box includes 16 track maze cards, 14 action cards, 40 passengeer cards and 1 player token (which is used by all players).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player starts with a pawn, $5000 and a loan of $10,000. Then, each player must buy his or her first car. In turn, a player rolls the dice and advances one&rsquo;s own pawn on the track and react to where ever the pawn lands. During the course of play a player may buy and use service stations and garages, purchase insurance, get involved in accidents, collect income and get stars, which represent safe driving awards. When a player buys a second car, that player takes two consecutive turns even though one still has only one pawn on the gameboard. A player who buys a third car may take three consecutive turns.&#10;&#10;The path the players travel on the gameboard crosses itself twice. There is a traffic light at one intersection that regulates movement as players approach it. The traffic light changes when a player lands on one of four &ldquo;red dot&rdquo; spaces. This allows players approaching from the other direction to advance while stopping traffic from the first direction.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate seven red stars and purchase the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham for $10,500 is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Now that players have learned to master the postal routes in the south, they naturally turn their eyes toward the north, looking for more routes to establish to add to their ever-growing postal networks. The new routes run between Holland and Sachsen - between Preu&szlig;en and the free cities. The players build new postal stations in order to provide fast service for important letters to the many new customers in the north.&#10; Hard-working postal carriers add horses to their carriages to enable them to travel farther and more safely, which will help the separated Preu&szlig;en provinces to achieve power and glory.&#10;&#10;With this expansion, we offer new ways for players to enjoy Thurn and Taxis. The new board opens up new areas for postal routes. To support the new board, we include new bonus tiles and new city cards (with horses on their backs to support the new rules). We hope players will enjoy these changes and the strategic opportunities they offer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Transfer is a simple abstract 2-player game that is played on a 4x4 grid. Each player starts with 4 egg-cups, in one of two colors, on the base row of the grid, with a ball on the two corner ones. The aim is to be the first player to move these cups to the baseline of the opponent and get the 2 balls again onto the 2 egg-cups on the edges. If the starting player does this first, then the opponent has the chance to get a draw if they manage to do the same thing in the turn immediately afterwards.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player picks one of two moves. A player can either move one cup with a ball to a free space that touches it, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Or a player can move the ball from one of their pieces to another one of their pieces that touches it in those same directions. When a blockade occurs, by 2 rows that block each other on the center rows, the active player may jump with a piece that contains a ball over an opponent's piece. When one player still has a piece on the start line, and the opponent has filled all other end-spaces, that piece needs to vacate its space right away. If this is impossible (when it doesn't contain a ball), then that player loses immediately.&#10;&#10;This appears to be Dieter Hartmann's only published game.&#10;&#10;PUBLICATION HISTORY:&#10;&#10;     1978 Transfer Edition Perlhuhn (G&#195;&#182;ttinger Spiele) - out of print&#10;&#10;&#10;Like all typical Edition Perlhuhn releases, this game comes in a tube, with chunky wooden pieces (black and red) and a board that is printed on a fake leather vinyl.&#10;&#10;ADDITIONAL INFO:&#10;&#10;     language skill needed: language neutral.&#10;     English translation: none.

They also get a random chit specifying a particular racer as first or last place.&#10;&#10;During the race itself, players influence the outcome of the races by playing from hands of ordinary playing cards to move raptors, and/or attack other raptors until the race is won.  Then players collect rewards according to their wagers.&#10;&#10;Three races are run, and the overall winner is the bettor with the most money at the end.&#10;&#10;The game is available either as rules only, in a kit with 6 velociraptor racers, or as a kit with the racers and a molded rubber track and winners' stand.  The rules contain all you need if you wish to make your own components, but the components themselves are excellent.&#10;&#10;",

Spaces on the board contain instructions for swimming activities, to be performed by the player who lands on the space (e.g., &quot;4 laps, freestyle&quot;). Some spaces have other instructions, such as &quot;Go back 1 space&quot; or &quot;Do 20 crunches.&quot; Swim Quest has been awarded US Patent number 7125016B1.&#10;&#10;",

Each &ldquo;trick&rdquo; will require differing levels of skill, and many will sap the stamina and strength of the Magician. Performance of tricks earns Money and Fame.

Doraemon wears a magical pouch on his tummy from which he produces the most amazing gadgets to help Nobita, but Nobita somehow always manages to misuse them.&#10;&#10;The game belongs to the large family of 'Millionaire' clones, which is itself derived from Monopoly. Players take on the role of one of four characters from the cartoon series: Doraemon; Nobita; Shizuka (Nobita's girlfriend); and Dorami (Doraemon's sister). Each player has a nifty miniature figurine to move around the track. Dice-rolls move the figurines and players earn or spend money according to where they land. Instead of properties, players land on adventures which they can 'purchase' and other players landing there in future have to pay the owner of the adventure. There are also chance cards.&#10;&#10;The manufacturer, Sun Hing Toys, makes several other Doraemon-themed board games.&#10;&#10;",

It is also a time when a small group of men rose against all odds amassing great fortunes and political power by laying their steel ribbons across America's vast plains and over her towering and majestic mountains. These were America's RAIL MASTERS....&#10;&#10;The year is 1862 and President Lincoln has just signed the Pacific Railroad Act granting you $100,000 and a steam locomotive. Your assignment is to safely travel across the United States and deliver five special spikes to your holding company.  The first Railroad to deliver all five spikes wins.&#10;&#10;Who will be the next RAIL MASTER?&quot;&#10;&#10;The Rail Masters Trust Company is a Trivial Pursuit inspired train trivia game with added economic and pick up and deliver mechanics. Players take the role of one of six holding companies from 1862 and start with $100,000 granted by the government. Starting from the roundhouse, players roll and move around the board answering train trivia questions to get extra moves. There are six spike squares of five different colors the players are aiming to land on where they can purchase a spike from the government. The train playing pieces have slots to hold two spikes maximum, so spikes must be delivered to the roundhouse before more can be picked up. On Rail Crossing spaces, &quot;community chest&quot; type cards are drawn that decrease or increase a player's money. Players can sell their spikes to any other player at any time for any price.&#10;&#10;The trivia questions are all multiple choice or true and false, so you don't need to be a train trivia expert to be competitive. If playing against a REAL train buff, you can always take away the multiple choice from that player and make them answer the questions outright to even the field...&#10;&#10;",

Two players, each using one of the two enclosed play books, try to maneuver each other into their own firing arcs using the easy to use movement charts given on each page.  As you and your opponent move, you flip to a new page, which shows your new position and sensor displays.&#10;&#10;The game uses a system similar to that used in the Ace of Aces series of games; players simultaneously choose a direction to move and these choices are cross-referenced to determine which page each turns to. The ships normally can only move to one of their three forward spaces or stay in place, but by spending shield points a ship can move directly sideways. If a player has the opponent within their firing arc they can choose to fire; shots remove more shield points at close range and ships can only fire every other turn. When a ship is out of shield points the opponent wins. Optional rules allow for the possibility that moving and firing will sometimes fail.&#10;&#10;The end of the rulebook mentions several related products: Q-Fighter DT (more detailed rules), Kree Tech (a wallet-sized version), and Fringe Wars, a card-based expansion which added campaign rules. However, it is unclear if any of these were ever published.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A very large bicycle race game, published in Denmark in 1998. The first edition contained stats for riders in the 1998 race season. Other seasons were to follow.&#10; The game was so large it actually came in two big boxes. Total weight was just over 15 lbs. (7kg)! One box contained the basic components to play and the other contained the specific components required to play the 1998/1999 race season. With the modular boards, just about any race course the Tour de France covers could be duplicated.&#10; Each rider stats card will determine if they are a star rider, mountain or sprint specialist or a good all around rider. These cards are based on real rider&rsquo;s stats. At the start of the game each player will build a team of 9 players that includes one star rider and the team you build to support him.&#10; The box came with four rule sets: Danish, German, French &amp; English.&#10;&#10;",

All the independent states of the time are shown on the board as their flags as a way to identify them, and as geographically correct in relation to each other as possible; each flag also exists as a game card. Each player gets their &quot;own&quot; random country in the beginning to start from, and the idea of the game is to try to gather as many different flags for yourself as possible; players move on the board using colour-dies and a right combination of colours allows a player to turn one of the flag cards - they are shuffled on the table face down, forming a memory game element - hoping for the flag of the country they're currently standing on, or at least a flag of same colours.&#10;&#10;Flags are scored at the end of the game with the Finnish flag and each player's &quot;own&quot; flag carrying bonus points.&#10;&#10;One of the last original Paletti publications; the brand ceased to exist soon after, and most of it's games were taken over by Peliko Oy.&#10;&#10;",

They take turns moving the landlords over one of the paths. As soon as a player succeeds in enclosing a triangle, the enclosed land becomes the property of that player. He then covers the triangle with a playing piece of his color. The land is now his and can never be recaptured.&#10;3. Take note: it is also possible to enclose several triangles at the same time.&#10;4. The game ends when all triangles on the playing board have been claimed as property. The winner is the player who owns the most pieces of land at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:&#10;&#10;     Landlord!

(It is independent of the Seafarers and Cities &amp; Knights expansions, but can be combined with them.)&#10;&#10;All of the variants and three of the scenarios have been available from various sources in Europe and the United States or through official websites. The Great Rivers and the Fishermen of Catan have been expanded somewhat for this expansion through extra tiles and player pieces.&#10;&#10;This compilation includes 5 scenarios:&#10;&#10;     The Fishermen of Catan - Originally released in the 05/2006 Spielbox magazine and then subsequently released in Games Quarterly magazine.  Expanded in this edition.&#10;     The Rivers of Catan - Originally released in the Atlantis scenario box, then subsequently in Games Quarterly magazine as &quot;The Great River&quot;.  Expanded in this edition to include two rivers, one occupying 4 tiles, and one occupying 3.&#10;     The Great Caravan - Originally released as a free expansion in Germany.&#10;     Barbarian Invasion - New in this edition. - Barbarians are invading Catan and the players have to try to stop them with new knight pieces. This plays very similarly to the flood mechanic in the Atlantis scenario from the Atlantis and Das Buch scenario packs.&#10;     Traders &amp; Barbarians - New in this edition. - You get new hexes, one for the castle, one to produce glass, and one to produce marble. You try to rebuild Catan after the invasion. You get gold and victory points if you finish tasks in the castle, but to do so you have to travel back and forth to the castle on roads and undeveloped paths. There are still some barbarians around who interfere with trade routes.&#10;&#10;&#10;It also includes 4 minor variants:&#10;&#10;     2-Player Rules - Use the new &quot;Commercial Chips&quot; to force trade with your opponent. Use 3rd and 4th neutral player to block your opponent.  Also available online: Klaus2player.pdf&#10;     Catan Event Cards - Originally released in the Atlantis scenario box, then subsequently released for sale separately. Replaces the dice with a deck of cards to minimize randomness.&#10;     The Harbormaster Card - Originally released in the Atlantis scenario box, then subsequently available online: harbormaster.pdf. Gives two victory points to the player with the most harbor points.&#10;     Friendly Robber Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;This game belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",

The chits are assembled on a separate board for each character, and &quot;will complete a story of amusing and rakish details- particularly if read aloud, and with dramatic relish.&quot;  Certain spaces, when landed on, have special, game altering effects, such as &quot;Heisenberg Attack&quot;, which forces all players to switch characters with the person to their right.&#10;&#10;&quot;One person play: All rules are the same, though exchange between other players is, obviously, impossible.  Do not despair; someday you will grow up to be a famous cartoonist and all of the kids who made fun of you will have miserable jobs and be desperately unhappy, but you will get to draw stories for lots of money about how you still hate them all.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Drill For Oil is a game where players can enjoy the fun and excitement of drilling for oil as in real life. One player is elected banker. The banker issues $10,000 to each player. (The banker is considered a player as well.) After unfolding the board, the banker shuffles the 10 drill for oil cards and places one face down on each site. To drill for oil, it costs $10,000. The banker goes first, and must state which oil well he wants to drill for oil on. He must then appropriate $10,000 to drill. There are 10 stock certificates representing 10% ownership in a well being drilled. The player drilling may sell all the stock or part of the stock. He must, however, offer a percentage of stock depending on the amount of players. (50% for 2 player, 60% for 3 or 4 players, 80% for 5 players.) At times a player may have to buy all the stock in a well if no other players want to invest in it. After the $10,000 is raised, the player pays the bank and flips the card. If it says dry hole, the stock is worthless. If it says have struck oil, each player who invested receives the dividend stated on the card. (Amounts vary on 6 of the cards, 4 are dry holes.) Play continues to the left until all 6 oil producing wells have been drilled. The game then ends and the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",
