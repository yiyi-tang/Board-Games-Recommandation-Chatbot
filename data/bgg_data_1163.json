Then he compares his result with the three revealed monster cards in the monster zone. He sets aside suitable dice and tries to get a suitable combination with a total of three attempts of rolling. If he succeeds, he has chased away the corresponding monster, takes the appropriate monster card with the printed victory points and places them in front of him. If a blue crystal is shown on the monster card, the player takes an additional crystal from the supply. This is worth additional victory points. If the player does not manage to roll a suitable combination, he has the opportunity to use his superpower to possibly chase away a monster. If this is not possible or if the player does not want this, he must draw a minus card from the minus card pile. A new monster is revealed and the next player takes his turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends IMMEDIATELY when one of the following conditions occur:&#10;&#10;     A player has chased away his seventh monster&#10;     A player has received his third blue crystal&#10;     The minus card pile has been used up&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Play ends when all possible glass is collected or an agreed time period has elapsed. Sea Glass finds are totalled, and the value of the rubbish is assessed by one last roll of the starfish dice.

(&quot;Hotta Imo Ijinna&quot; is a Japanese sentence which means &quot;Don't tamper with these potatoes harvested.&quot;)&#10;&#10;The game has dozens of cards, each of which has some foreign words written in it. Each round, players take one of these cards and hear how the words on the card sound through Google Translator (URL is known from the card). Each player then writes down what they heard in Japanese. They score points if their answer is the same as someone else. After several rounds, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;Because this game uses Google Translator, internet access with a speaker is required to play it.&#10;&#10;The designer chose three languages that are uncommon in Japan: Telugu, Thai, and Urdu. The designer liked the beautiful shape of the characters, and that they are unusual in Japan, so players cannot imagine their pronunciation.

You should expect a lighthearted game, where your super villain character may tell his evil plan to the other contestant, who is apparently a 120 year old kung-fu master ... on the top of a moving train.&#10;&#10;The game requires two standard 52 decks and a pair of six sided dice for 2 players. Things that you already have probably. You can print one page to browse your character of choice, but let&rsquo;s be honest: most of you will use your smartphones to check your character sheet.&#10;&#10;There is not always a winner and a loser of a fight, if you can&rsquo;t put on a good show together, the audience will be displeased, and the director will &quot;remove&quot; the characters from the tournament. If the show was above expectations, the director may have mercy even on the defeated one too, meaning, the character progress won&rsquo;t be lost. Different characters use different subset of cards, and also alter the standard rules, giving more variety to the game, and offering more fun. Also, the fight can be spiced up with several scenarios listed in this booklet. Different environments may alter the rules, and may change the way how the contestants fight.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the player who not only owns a job and own house, but is also not in debt and his home is not occupied by a tenant. In the event that more than one player meets these conditions, the victory is determined by better paid work, goods and money.&#10;&#10;The instructions, like the content of the cards and fields on the board, are described in a humorous, or even satirical way.

Unlike some social deduction games, OV relies less on logical deduction and more by varying degrees of confidence, forcing players to lean on their intuition.&#10;&#10;Each player will be either a Conspirator working for the Wehrmacht (German Military) or a Loyalist working for the Gestapo, the Nazi secret state police.   The Conspirators know who each other are but members of the Loyalists are unaware of anyone&rsquo;s identity but their own.  Each round, each player will be assigned as an Operative, an Agent, or the Gestapo Chief.  Operatives have been ordered to meet Hitler in a high-level meeting and contribute to a mission.  Agents will investigate Operatives in an attempt to ascertain their motives by way of Suspicion cards.  The Gestapo Chief&rsquo;s primarily role will be to scrutinize Operatives and detain those who are particularly suspicious for additional interrogation.  In their assigned roles, Conspirators will attempt to undermine Nazi operations without raising suspicions and secretly plot the F&uuml;rher&rsquo;s assassination.  They must leverage luck and opportunity to manage perceptions, sustain alibis, and evade suspicion long enough to successfully execute Operation Valkyrie.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The catacomb tiles are first placed face down in the cathedral and the fresco tiles are placed on top of them. Players can now purchase cartographer tiles in the hostel, which show locations in the cathedral that have to be painted in order to gain access to the catacomb tiles below. A catacomb tile can be sold for coins or kept till the end of the game, in which case the bishop awards extra victory points to the players.&#10;&#10;Module 14: The Pews&#10;This module changes the market action and the planning phase. The chapel board is placed next to the game board and every player takes six wooden planks and places them in front of their screen. New market tiles will allow the players to purchase these when they visit the market. In the planning phase players may place their assistants on the new action tiles to use their collected wood to build pews for the church and collect some extra points.&#10;&#10;Module 15: The Dome&#10;The dome tiles are shuffled and placed on the nine central fresco spaces, before the fresco tiles are placed on top. When a player finishes a fresco tile, they take the dome tile underneath and places it in front of them. A dome tile shows  a combination of two colors that the player needs to gain the depicted victory points. However, these tiles can only be painted at the end of the game, after the fresco in the cathedral is finished. So good planning and timing will be needed in order to keep the necessary paint cubes to finish the dome at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Module 16: The Black Market&#10;A poor painter can&#202;&#188;t be faulted for succumbing to a tempting offer from the dubious merchants of the black market. Their paints, stored in large barrels, are not expensive, but you never know which paint you will get...&#10;When you visit a market booth to buy paints, you may assign one of your apprentices to visit the Black Market instead. For this apprentice, a paint tile will be pulled at random from the draw bag, and the player must purchase this paint if possible. Since tiles are returned to the bag when a player visits a market booth or closes one down, players earlier in turn order will have a better guess what they might receive from the Black Market.&#10;&#10;Module 17: The Guild Helps&#10;Painters often are missing urgently needed supplies for their work, but thankfully the members of the Painters Guild stick together and are willing to exchange among themselves. A lucky painter may find what they need at the guild.&#10;Each round one random basic paint and one random blended paint are placed on the guild tile. Using one of the two actions received for sending an apprentice to blend paints, the player may exchange one of their paints for the same type of paint from the guild tile (basic for basic and blended for blended). A player may now make two exchanges, two blends, or do one of each.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's 1938 and you've been sentenced to serve time in the notorious Alcatraz prison. The island is filled with the most dangerous criminals. Some are sentenced to life, but you don't plan on staying that long.&#10;Get ready to escape Alcatraz with nine routes based on real life attempts.&#10;Don't get caught on land.&#10;Don't get killed in the water.&#10;----&#10;&#10;The game is a competitive, dice rolling, and card collecting game featuring 2-4 Players. Play begins at The Warden Johnston boat, named after the longest-serving Warden of Alcatraz.&#10;&#10;There are three phases of the game Processing, Doing Time and Escape.&#10;&#10;During Processing, players take turns rolling two d6 dice to move and sometimes fight with each other if they land on the same space. The goal here is to arrive fastest at the Main Cell house in order to have the advantage of choosing an Inmate Card. Some inmate cards start with a tool, representing a tool that that inmate used in a real escape attempt.&#10;&#10;Doing time begins!  Players take turns circling the board through the Mess Hall, Recreation Yard, Laundry, and Model Industries by rolling two d6 dice on their turn. Landing on colored arrows grants a card of that color. The goal here is to collect Planning and Escape Cards. Each player may have up to 4 of each color card, all the while consulting their Escape Chart in order to plan their best escape route.&#10;&#10;Certain cards like Model Prisoner give you special access to Grounds Escapes.  Guard cards can be good or bad news when landing on black spaces. Rolling snake eyes grants The Warden Card, which acts as a favor that can be cashed in, negating a troublesome Guard card during an escape.&#10;&#10;When a player collects the appropriate cards he or she announces their escape then moves their pawn to the Escape Arrow space based on historic routes used by real-life historical prisoners. Rolling their single d6 dice to avoid being captured, shot, suffering hypothermia, worse.&#10;&#10;The first one to Escape wins!&#10;&#10;",

Once you have enough materials, you must start building - small outposts at first; and later on, larger settlements to suit your Faction's ideals. You must also full-body-print more colonists from personas downloaded through your ansibles - a weird kind of immigration.&#10;&#10;Build, conquer or destroy - your fame or infamy will attract more immigrants. More people mean more expertise and influence.

Gameplay-wise, many new flip and destruction effects enable many new synergies, also with cards from the base game.&#10;&#10;In Crimson Company, two opposing players take on the roles of adventurous noblemen in a cut-throat fantasy world. In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.&#10;&#10;Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle's lane by the time that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.&#10;&#10;Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game. Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &quot;on offer&quot;. You may bid coins on only one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The player with the lead throws 3 colored dice and combines them to move his train on a modular path with different landscapes (mountains, hills, lakes, snow and deserts), trying to stop at the stations to pick up passengers. Passenger tiles are worth only 1 point, but if players are able to deliver them to the next station, then the tiles are flipped over and may be worth from 2 to 4 points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The unused dice may be invested in some powerful and surprising bonus tiles to be used any time during the game. The first train driver who arrives at the last station of the path will also get a punctuality bonus, represented by a stationmaster hat.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of Tutti in Treno not only are thought to highlight the idea of a path game keeping it always fun, but they also encourage kids to make some basic strategy choices, training at the same time logic and sense of space.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
