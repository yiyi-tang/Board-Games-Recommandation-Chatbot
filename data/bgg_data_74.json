    "Description": "A set of medieval miniature wargaming rules intended for 28mm miniatures but playable in any scale.&#10;&#10;Units consist of 12 foot or 6 mounted miniatures, which are used to fight out skirmish battles between armies of 4-6 units per side.&#10;&#10;Units need to be activated by dice rolls which are easier to pass if you choose orders well suited to that particular troop type. For example, knights will charge more easily than other troops, and archers are easier to command to shoot rather than charge.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple and to some extent they abstract medieval battle in favor of easy game play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In On the Underground: Paris/New York, players build the Paris M&eacute;tro lines or the New York City Subway lines. Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;On each turn, four destination cards are available, corresponding to stations on the map. You can take up to four actions; an action is either building track by placing one of your track tokens on the board or taking a branch token. A player may use two branch tokens to branch out of an existing line (whereas normally lines can be extended only at the endpoints). After each player's turn, a passenger token is moved along players' lines, avoiding walking as much as possible, to reach one or two destinations determined at the beginning of the turn. Destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, then the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;Players score points in two ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by collecting landmark tiles (in Paris), by connecting stations across water (in New York) or at the end of the game if they have achieved their secret objectives (in Paris).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     By having the passenger use their lines when moving.&#10;&#10;&#10;After all destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Paris is a thoughtful map offering many options. To win, you need to strike the right balance between collecting sets of tokens, connecting secret destinations, blocking other players while not being blocked yourself, and of course carrying the passenger. Paris is the refined elder sister of the original On the Underground: London map and is recommended for experienced players.&#10;&#10;New York is a fast-paced map reflecting the hectic pace of life in the Big Apple. It encourages players to mirror real life by creating lines through Manhattan, but you have to build quickly to keep up with the always-moving passenger.&#10;&#10;",

In the action phase, a player can either select a Main Street action or pass. The action phase repeats until each player has passed.&#10;&#10;To take a Main Street action, a player must choose from the communal Main Street cards, and place the required number of pennies on the open action space. The player then carries out the effect of that card. Possible actions include purchasing a building, placing a worker, rearranging buildings, or claiming the Mayor meeple to become the new 1st player.&#10;&#10;Each player places purchase buildings in their lane. If they're able to connect a penny link, they get an extra penny at the end of each upkeep phase. If they're able to connect a victory point link, they get an extra victory point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In the upkeep phase, all players gain 1 penny. Players then resolve all effects in their lane as indicated by the upkeep symbol and their penny links.&#10;&#10;The final round is triggered when one player has 10 or more points on their lane, and the player with the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;",

It was a cult-game phenomenon in the Grateful Dead universe. The game flourished with the help of college students and Deadhead fans.&#10;&#10;You play by rolling the five Cosmic Wimpout cubes and get points for each 5, 10, or Flash (triplet) that you roll. You can accumulate points towards the winning total by ending your turn or risking it all, because if you roll and don't score, you lose all the points for that turn, and the next player goes. Thus like life, &quot;Sometimes you are in the cosmos, and sometimes you wimp out.&quot; After certain results, a player may choose to end his turn, scoring the points he has accumulated. The first player to reach an agreed-upon score wins (300-600 for a short game with scores kept on paper, 1000-1500 more typically on the game boards), and the game can fit into a small dice tube.&#10;&#10;Throughout the years, several variations of dice designs have made early versions of the game collectible. There are several silk-screened fabric boards that vary the game length and require the player to use a personalized or improvised pawn.&#10;&#10;Numerous variants and house rules exist, and players are encouraged to change the rules (by unanimous agreement), even during the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;WWII Commander, Volume One: Battle of the Bulge&quot; is the first in a series of fast-playing area-based wargames on key campaigns of the Second World War. Battle of the Bulge is a two-player wargame of the German offensive against the Western Allies in December 1944, designed by renowned wargame designer John H. Butterfield and based on his original boardgame design that was later released in digital format by Shenandoah Studios, an imprint of Slitherine UL Ltd.&#10;&#10;The simple elegance and high player-interaction of the WWII Commander games recreates the tension of key battles of the Second World War. The overall game system is easy to learn and makes a great introduction to war games, but mastering its tactics and strategy is a true challenge as the players take turns deciding which units to activate on either attack or defense. As the German player, you must make big gains and be as aggressive as possible while you hold the numerical advantage without over-committing your units, over-extending supply lines or falling prone to fuel shortages. As the Allied player, you must first withstand the initial German surprise attack and coordinate effective holding actions while defending key geographic objectives as you muster your arriving forces for counterattacks.&#10;&#10;The package features premium components throughout; from the mounted game board and oversized units, to the activation cubes and wooden control discs, sure to appeal to war gamers and euro gamers alike. The rules are simple, game play is fast and furious and can be completed in a single sitting, and victory may be achieved by either side at different stages of the game.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10 (no hidden units)&#10;Time Scale: 1 day, composed of multiple alternating player turns&#10;Map Scale: abstract areas approx. 15 miles across&#10;Unit Scale: Divisions&#10;Players: one to two, best with two&#10;Playing Time: 45 minute intro scenario, 3 hour campaign&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Mounted 25 x 22 inch map&#10;    140 over-sized 3/4&quot; counters&#10;    Rules booklet&#10;    German Order of Battle Appearance Display&#10;    Allied Order of Battle Appearance Display&#10;    Two player Aid cards&#10;    50 Activation cubes&#10;    40 wooden German control discs&#10;    Seven 10-sided dice&#10;    Box and Lid&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Originally released by Fata Morgana in the 1980s, KREMLIN is a European-style boardgame where players compete to control the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;The Jolly Roger KREMLIN features updated art and better components created in the style of 1930s Soviet poster propaganda. This edition has an error on the board that has the name of the game covering part of the graphics and text on the board.&#10;&#10;Kremlin is played for up to ten turns, ending as soon as the Party Chief successfully waves three times at the May Day Parade or when so many politicians are dead or in Siberia that the Party Chief can disband the Politburo and take complete power for himself.&#10;&#10;Each turn has phases.  The most important of these are the KGB trials (which can send party members to Siberia or the cemetery) and the Defense Ministry's Spy Investigations which can also force politicians on a winter's gulag holiday.  With the KGB, the catch is that the higher up the ladder the target, the more difficult to bring down, and Party Chiefs tend to change KGB leaders who take shots at the top...  For the Defense Minister, his investigations require a trial to be successful--and a guilty vote, and that isn't always possible in the Central Committee.&#10;&#10;The catch?  Players allot influence secretly at the start of the game and don't reveal it until it is used, meaning no one knows who controls the KGB or any other ministry, not until Influence is revealed--and even then, who knows who still has undeclared influence on that person?  It is possible that players can swap control back and forth over the KGB chief even as he is trying to determine who to assassinate!&#10;&#10;Once the carnage is done, players have to survive the ravages of aging--and every time a politician takes action, he ages faster than normal...your 50 yr old star of the party?  Well, suddenly he's acting like he's 83, Comrade.  Life near the top will do that to you.  In the Health phase, politicians may die or grow sick--sick politicians can choose to go to the hospital, but while there, they exert no influence and their responsibilities pass on to other politicians. Sometimes this means your man must make the heroic sacrifice to the Rodina and remain on the job even while at death's door.&#10;&#10;Once we know who is still alive, the Party Chief is allowed to move politicians between posts.  After all, he's in control of the bureaucracy.  He can move people up and down, and when he's done, upper ministers do so as well--but can only affect politicians below them on the food chain.  Heck, politicians can even sponsor comrades in exile in Siberia to come back to the People.  Of course, each person you bring back ages you five years....want to bring back five?  Age 25 years in the blink of an eye, Tovarich.&#10;&#10;Intrigue cards allow you to take control of situations or foil other players' schemes.  In one of the older versions, you could have things like Chernobyl take place in 1920.  That's been corrected--so that while events may be the same, they have now been made era-appropriate.&#10;&#10;The turn ends with the May Day Parade.  If the party chief is healthy, he can wave throughout the day making people happy--clearly our socialist union is prospering.  But if he's sick, sometimes he leaves early and is unable to wave, sending doubts through the ranks.  If a faction (player) earns three waves, they win the game.&#10;&#10;The Jolly Roger version provides three different KREMLIN games in one box.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia.  This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.&#10;     A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'.  Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians.  It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game.&#10;     A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution.  This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia.  It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

He originally called it Fischerandom, and later changed the name to Fischer Random Chess, which is also frequently used. The name Chess960 was proposed by a FIDE committee and is now the official one.&#10;&#10;",

The character tiles are double-sided with different characters on each side, so 16 characters in total for the huge amount of combinations. Goods cards have a value from 1 to 10, with only one card with value 1 and ten cards with value 10. On your turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move the &quot;camel&quot; on the current character tile to the next tile. If you want to move more, pay coins to move further.&#10;    Pick up the goods card on the tile to add it to your shop (in front of you) or your warehouse (your hand).&#10;    Use the character skill on the tile or collect three coins.&#10;&#10;&#10;Depending on the the number of goods in your shop, you can take the corresponding majority token. The game ends either:&#10;&#10;(1) When no more cards are in the deck, at which point a majority token is worth 1 victory point, and the majority of each goods in their warehouse(hands) is worth points equal to the goods' value, or&#10;(2)  When any player has four different goods in hand and has collected four majority tokens, at which point they win the game immediately.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Monkeys, by the way, are from south German television commercials.&#10;&#10;The game includes options you might not expect from the name or from an unknown small publisher. Each player has a limited amount of movement when hitting or returning a shot, and then can &quot;borrow&quot; from their next move but this puts them under pressure and thus limits their ability to shoot most effectively. Other clever options include the ability to serve and volley using a clever wooden block idea, the ability to lob over a volley using a ramp, and the ability to smash a volley.&#10;&#10;",

King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    First Newbury 1643: Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry. Essex&rsquo;s stand on Round Hill stopped the Royalist and saved the rebellion.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Cheriton 1644: Sir William Waller&rsquo;s Southern and Western Association Armies with the help of the London Trained Bands defeated Hopton&rsquo;s Royalists in the rolling hills and hedges. The first in a series of victories in early to mid-1644 the signaled a turning tide in the war.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Cropredy Bridge 1644: Confident from his victory at Cheriton, Sir William Waller seeks to exploit a gap in the Royalist Main Army on the march. Waller divided his forces and attempted to trap part of the Royalist Army, but difficult terrain and quick reaction by the Royalists turned the tables and left much of Waller&rsquo;s army trapped and he was given a stinging rebuke.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Marston Moor 1644: The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to affect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arose: Cromwell, a name inextricably linked with the English Civil War and the key player in the following two civil wars.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Second Newbury 1644: The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Naseby 1645: The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634: Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at N&ouml;rdlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Wittstock 1636: The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Second Breitenfeld 1642: Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another N&ouml;rdlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Jankau 1645: Field Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign against the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emperor himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes. The armies came together in the wooded hill country southeast of Prague.&#10;&#10;&#10;  &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series Rulebook&#10;    &ldquo;This Accursed Civil War&rdquo; Playbook&#10;    &ldquo;Sweden Fights On&rdquo; Playbook&#10;    5 Counter Sheets&#10;    1 Series Marker Sheet&#10;    4.5 Back Printed Map Sheets (For 11 Battles)&#10;    6 Two-Sided Battle Specific Player Aid Cards&#10;    2 11x17 Folded Player Aid Cards&#10;    1 Orders Summary Card&#10;&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Locals and tourists in Maui are heading to the beach for a chance to find a nice spot to lay their towels and enjoy the amazing view of the Hawaiian ocean. In Maui, you want to find and place beachgoers on your sand so that they create pleasing patterns, while also placing their towels close to the ocean or under the shade of trees or umbrellas to earn the most points. However, getting too close to either of these areas is risky and might ruin their plans!&#10;&#10;In the game, you have your own beach board with room for 13 towels, the board has seven rows in which towels can be placed, and during set-up, you randomly place eight umbrellas in designated locations on your board. Each player places one random towel in the left most column of their board; each towel has three different patterns on it. Place six random tiles in the two rows of the market and one sand dollar in each row.&#10;&#10;On a turn, either take all the sand dollars from either row of the market or take a towel from the market; towels cost 0, 1, or 2 sand dollars, with those dollars being placed in the market row. When you place a towel, you must match at least one pattern with the towel that's rightmost on your beach board and you want to match as many patterns as possible. For each match you make, you advance that pattern's scoring marker 1-3 spaces on the score board; the closer to the ocean or the shade the more points you score, but if you place part of a towel outside the play area, you're penalized.&#10;&#10;If you cover an umbrella, you receive its bonus, whether that's advancing a pattern's scoring marker or receiving one of two types of pearls.&#10;&#10;When someone places a towel in the final column of their beach board, you complete the round, then see who's scored the most points from patterns, pearls, and leftover sand dollars, which are each worth a point. Instead of playing with umbrellas, you can flip your beach board to find a septet of sand crabs. Whenever you cover a crab with a towel, the crab crawls onto that portion of the towel, costing you both that pattern and a few points.&#10;&#10;",

Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;Carcassonne f&uuml;r 2 is a two-player version of Carcassonne that comes in a metal box and contains 48 tiles and 12 meeples.&#10;&#10;",

One bottle per person is the new law &mdash; thus bribes, suitcase inspections, and arrests are on the agenda. Only one will emerge the Soda Kingpin.&#10;&#10;Each round in Soda Smugglers, one player takes a turn in the role of a border guard while the other players act as travelers. In a quest to acquire coveted carbonation and its accompanying bottle caps, the border guard tries to confiscate as many sodas as possible while only the cleverest travelers will sneak across with their fizzy contraband. After each player has been the border guard (twice in a 3-4 player game, once in a 5-8 player game), the game ends and whoever has the most bottle caps wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This means that you aren't quite sure what's going to happen in each game &ndash; you can&rsquo;t load a particular country because you know something is going to happen, because there are very few fixed events. The point of the events is to add friction - you&rsquo;re never in complete control and will have to react to changing events.&#10;&#10;Technology is represented by a technology tree including nuclear weapons, the space race, armed forces, computing and industry and for the Soviets agricultural progress.&#10;&#10;Military is covered in three areas - nuclear, which prevents aggression against your nation; Conventional - which gives options to be more aggressive; Navy - boosting intelligence gathering and ability to invade from the sea, as well as hunting enemy strategic missile submarines.&#10;&#10;Spies are deployed by players to try and instigate coups or stamp them out, and for the Soviets to infiltrate and steal western technology. CIA will be busy security those secrets and keeping advanced trade items away from the Soviets.&#10;&#10;Lastly, there is an intelligence track - a high intel capability from U2 spy planes, satellites or submarines gives more ability to influence the events as they come out and react quicker than your opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fluttering Souls is a captivating, beautifully illustrated two-player game based on the Japanese legend of The White Butterfly. You will compete to collect a kaleidoscope of butterflies in the hope of being visited by The White Butterfly; the soul of a lost loved one.&#10;&#10;Legend of the White Butterfly&#10;Many years ago an apprentice merchant named Takahama fell hopelessly in love with a woman named Akiko. They became engaged, but, tragically, Akiko died before they could be wed. &#10;Takahama was distraught. He had built a life and a successful career, but he could not bear to be away from his love. Such was his dedication to Akiko that he abandoned his trade and gave his life to the upkeep of the cemetery where she was buried. &#10;For 50 years Takahama visited Akiko&rsquo;s grave every day with a single pure white rose. One day, Takahama fell so ill he could not go outside. Fearing he may die, his sister and niece came to care for him. While he lay there, unable to move, a butterfly of the purest white landed gently on his pillow. Annoyed, Takahama&rsquo;s niece tried to shoo the butterfly, but it would not stray from the pillow of the dying man. &#10;As Takahama&rsquo;s final breath left his body, so the butterfly flew to the grave of Akiko and disappeared. White butterflies are believed to be the visiting souls of loved ones. Worried that Takahama had not visited her grave that day; Akiko looked over him and did not leave until his soul had joined hers.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;Fluttering Souls is a 2 player game, made up of 3 - 5 rounds. In each round players take turns collecting butterflies to earn victory points, either in a set or by themselves. The player that collects the most victory points at the end of a round is awarded a White Butterfly Token; a visit from a lost loved one. The first player to collect 3 White Butterfly Tokens is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The survival of the Western Empire depends on one man: Flavius Stilicho, barbarian general, commander-in-chief of the armies of Rome, and defacto ruler of the West.&#10;&#10;STILICHO: LAST OF THE ROMANS is the long-anticipated follow-up to designer Robert DeLeskie's popular and challenging solitaire game WARS OF MARCUS AURELIUS. The brain-boiling card angst and nail-biting combats that made that game so compelling are back, along with some new wrinkles that make for a more challenging and nuanced decision space. For example, the Surge mechanism that caused so many gamers to invent new curse words is now more nefarious, with each enemy card having specific surge effects. Rome's enemies sometimes bump into each other, resulting in enemy-on-enemy battles. Regions might go into revolt, garrisons might defect to the banner of the pretender Constantine III, and the wily courtier Olympius might turn the emperor Honorius against you.&#10;&#10;No wonder the historical Stilicho only lasted until turn 3! If you want to win, you'll have to last much longer than that, all while taking on tougher and more resilient enemies than poor Marcus had to face, and with less resources at your disposal. Will you prevent the sack of Rome and the fall of the Western Empire?&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Epigo's simultaneous action selection makes every round of the game exciting, even though Epigo features relatively simple rules and mechanics.  Epigo is also modular - the boxed game includes rules for 21 variants, with more variants available on our website.  Variants modify one or more of the core rules, providing unique challenges and adding countless hours of replayability.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;&#10;To win, be the first to capture three of your opponents&rsquo; Epigons by pushing them off the edge of the board.  Epigons have a rank between 1 and 7 dictating the priority at which they move.  At the start of every round, both players choose and stack three Orders from their hand. The top Order of a stack marks the first move, the middle tile is the second move, and the third tile is the last move.  Each Order has arrows on one side, indicating the direction the corresponding Epigon will try to move.  Once both players have locked in their moves, the stacks are revealed and unraveled.  First, compare the top Order on each stack.  The higher ranking Epigon moves one space in the direction shown on the arrows.  Then the other Epigon (matching the lower priority Order) moves in the same manner.  If both players reveal Orders of the same rank they cancel and neither Epigon moves (players often try to make this happen intentionally for various nefarious purposes). After three moves, players pick up all of their Orders and start the next round.&#10;&#10;When moving an Epigon, one of three things will happen: it will Slide, Push, or be Blocked.  When an Epigon moves into an empty space, it Slides into it. If that space is occupied however, the Epigon tries to Push in that direction instead.  An Epigon must have a majority of friendly pieces moving in the same direction whenever it tries to Push otherwise the move is Blocked.  The full rulebook contains detailed explanations of the movement rules, and is available on our website.&#10;&#10;The boxed game accomodates up to 4 players in teams of 2, and introduces variant play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "[SPI Advertisement c1978]&#10;&#10;SWORDS AND SORCERY&#10;Quest and Conquest in the Age of Magic&#10;&#10;- Separate Army and Quest Game, plus Role-Playing Version&#10;- Full Background &ldquo;History&rdquo; and Characters&#10;- Professionally Illustrated by Tim Kirk&#10;&#10;The Valley of the Great Sword is a much warred over area on a small planet in a trinary system many lightyears and eons removed from Terra.  Superficially, there is no great difference between this highly prized region and any other coveted area that nations have fought over since time immemorial.  But the Valley, and indeed the whole planet, guards a secret so valuable that few off-planet visitors that have visited that remote corner of the galaxy have all been mercilessly killed.  For the Valley is an area of great magicks, where technology has all but disappeared.&#10;&#10;Long ago in the Age of the Great Upheaval (which not even the oldest of the denizens of the Valley can recall), the Council of Wizards abolished all weapons that were more advance than those used in Earth's Middle Ages.  This was because (most scholars have it) mages could be killed by long range weapons before they could employ their defensive spells, and greatly feared the advent of mass-produced technology.  But the population of that world trusted mages no more than you and I, and there followed a series of great wars which succeeded in devastating all areas of the planet with the exception of the Valley (called Ararlve by the ancients).&#10;&#10;A great meeting was held at the Altar of the Elder Gods, and its purpose was to determine whether the Human race should be allowed to survive.  The Dragons, The Swamp-Creatures and the Spiders all vociferously argued for the extermination of all mortals, as they greatly feared the return of wizards who would be able to challenge their power.  But the Elves and Dwarrows who are kin to Man showed mercy, and the meeting finally resolved that mortals would forever be excluded from the Valley.  Grisha, then the greatest among Dragons, prophesied that the Elves and Dwarrows would meet their doom at the hands of Men.  This so enraged Gwaimallion Elflord that he joined Grisha in mortal combat and slew him on the spot.  As Grisha died he pronounced his deathcurse upon Elves and Dwarrows, &ldquo;My prophecy shall come true within three Ages!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;It was a shaken group of creatures who adjourned the great meeting.  But none would for get Grisha's curse, and many sought to destroy Men in any way possible.  Even some of the Elves and Dwarrows, fearful of the prophecy, sought to kill Men wherever they might be found.  But the human race is a hardy one, and is not so easy to eliminate.  For an entire Age, Men throughout the planet barely survived, running from their many oppressors.  But when the Second Age dawned, the other races began to accept Men, and rudimentary civilizations developed.&#10;&#10;Since the beginning of recorded time, all races have shown equal adeptness at handling manna, the energy from which all magic emanates.  But only the race of Man can create power items, which are great storehouses of manna.  And with these power items the race of Man evolves superhumans adept at handling the items.  It is this chain of events that all other races fear, for a united human race can defeat all other inhabitants of the world combined once they reach this stage.&#10;&#10;And so, at the beginning of the Third Age A.U. (After the Upheaval), the race of Man began to dominate once again.  The reappearance of Wizards and the conquest of half the world occurred in less than one century.  The Elder Races recognized this threat for what it was, but they were unable to co-operate amongst each other due to age-old differences.  The situation became dire when the various nations coalesced into the Second Empire.  Soon all lands but the Valley were Human-controlled.&#10;&#10;The Valley, root of the most powerful magic, from which the power of Man stemmed, now ironically provided refuge from Man.  The Valley could not be tamed by Man, and in its own defense it produced great amounts of manna.  At this point, forces of the Empire invaded the fabled city of Urf Durfal on the outskirts of the Valley and sought to conquer it in one swift stroke.  Leading the charge into the Valley was Emperor Coron the Unconquerable, and his defeat at the hands of Zurik Bladebreaker Dwarfking signaled the rebirth of the ancient races.  But that was not all, that was coming back to the Valley.  Two great and evil wizards each sought to be the Dark Lord, while a renegade noble sought to establish a separate nation in the heart of the Valley.  Contact was made with the inhabitants of the daemonic plane, and all sorts of demons, minor and major, roamed the Valley.  To cap it all off, discovery of several of the ancient and most powerful power items occurred.  The Empire had a most formidable challenge.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery is a game portraying the climactic period of the War against the Elder Races.  The Army Game, which deals with the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; battles of the war, uses a fairly simple combat system so that the Players may better explore the detailed spell lists, the Diplomacy rules and the various game mechanics that deal with all the elements necessary to fantasy.  Twelve Scenarios, beginning with the aforementioned Coron's campaign in the Valley and concluding with the final attempt to capture the Valley by the Empire, deal with all the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; fantasy situations.  Each Player is given control of an army and one or more Characters.  While the individual army units are important, it is the Characters who dominate the Army Game, by their leadership and (for those with magical abilities) their spell-casing abilities.&#10;&#10;Also included in the Swords and Sorcery package is a Quest Game, which involves the Players using the various Characters during periods where there is a lull in the War.  A Player will be given a specified number of Characters and objective, and seeks to perform better against the nasties or villain than his opponent(s).  Of course, your brave fighter may be vanquished by a fearsome troll before he is able to battle the guardian of the sword he seeks, or your Magic User may be defeated by a Spectre.  There are great perils in the Valley.  It will not do for a Dwarf to go merrily traipsing through the provinces of the Elves, else he be captured and need to be rescued by his kindred.  But a band of battle-hardened adventurers can defeat nearly any threat that besets them &ndash; the challenge is to avoid the death of one or more of the brave questers.  All of these possibilities are handled by such rules as the expansion of the spell list, a detailed personal combat routine, and even a Section on how to create your own character, if those provided with the game do not satisfy.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery includes a 22&rdquo; by 35&rdquo; game-map which portrays the Valley of the Great Sword, 400 four-color counters which represent many different races &ndash; Human, Elf, Dwarf, Goblin, Hobgoblin, Spider, Dragon, Swamp-Creature, Cronk, Demon and Monster &ndash; that live in or intrude upon the Valley, 56 illustrated cards, consisting of 40 Character illustrations, 10 Magic (or Power) Item illustrations, and 6 Monster illustrations, and a lengthy rules booklet including an extensive fantasy background.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery represents the culmination of over a year's work, and includes a wide range of fantasy elements.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;This fantasy wargame is really two games in one. The Army game uses SPI zones-of-control and a combat results table. Forces include elves, dwarves, orcs, spiders, swamp creatures and a host of others set in a fictional valley on a fictional world. Some of the more exotic inclusions are memorable for their pun value:  Unamit Ahezredit, Logarithm Son of Algorithm; places such as the Evelyn Woods and the Stream of Consciousness, as well as the notorious Hills of Avalon; and peoples such as the Corflu (Correction Fluid) Cultists, the (communist) Orcish Revolutionary Council, and the dreaded Killer Penguins.  X the Unknown could potentially conjure the SS Wiking Division. The Quest game is concerned exclusively with characters and is akin to a role-playing game.The game appeared with two covers: a blue box with a Tim Kirk illustration and a red box with a John Butterfield illustration. The games are otherwise identical.&#10;&#10;",

He has decided to alter the lines of succession and will bequeath his entire kingdom either to the feline goddess Bast or to the canine god Anubis, but which one?&#10;&#10;In Heir to the the Pharaoh you and your opponent play as Bast and Anubis, each one vying for the Pharaoh's affection &mdash; and for his throne! Impress the Pharaoh by digging your mighty paws into the sand. Build majestic Shrines, Sun Temples and Obelisks! Use Animal Magic to unleash the power of the gods, who will help you win the favor of the Pharaoh!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game combines intense card play with a spacious and colorfully illustrated game board. It mingles multiple mechanisms, including civilization-building (with tile placement and network building), bidding, set collection, area control, and hand management (with players required to exchange all used cards with their opponent at the end of each round). Seven separate player abilities re-combine each round, depending on the favor of the gods earned that round by each player. For example, earning the favor of the god Ra lets you add a Player Disc to the current Sun for area control around the edges of the board. Ptah allows you to claim the current Monument Card for set collection scoring. Seshat lets you place the current Monument Standee on the board to add to the network of Monuments in play. Geb and Nut let you claim and rotate this Monument Standee and aim it at other Monuments to score points. The Pharaoh lets you secretly contribute cards to the construction of the Pyramid, awarding the greater contributor many points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Over a series of eight rounds, players work to build a Pyramid and a series of smaller monuments to impress the Pharaoh. By performing actions unique to each god, players build monuments and align them to point at other monuments, gaining influence over the Pharaoh as they do so. Once the Pyramid is completed, the player with the most points is declared the Heir to the Pharaoh and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Bloody April is a standalone game using a similar format to Elusive Victory/Downtown, modified to cover the unique aspects of air combat during World War 1. The game covers the pivotal air combat over the Arras sector, France from March until the end of May 1917. Players take on the roles of Royal Flying Corps commander or German Imperial Air Service commander for their respective sides and will have a multitude of taskings available to accomplish and complete their objectives. Bloody April will include both single mission scenarios and multi-mission/multi-day campaigns to allow players to play out large scale battles in a manageable timeframe.&#10;&#10;Bloody April recreates entire air raids in detail. Each player will have many unique tactical challenges to overcome. Both players will have numerous taskings available such as Bombing, Recon, Artillery Cooperation, Contact Patrols, Balloon Busting, Offensive Patrols, Line Patrols and Trench Strafing. Players will also have Anti-Aircraft systems available such as different caliber &quot;Archie&quot;, AA guns and &quot;Flaming Onions&quot; incendiary weapons to hinder their opponent&rsquo;s movements. The map covers a significant portion of the Arras sector from Bethune and Lens in the North to Cambrai in the South. All the major aerodromes in this theatre of operations are displayed on map with a scale of 1nm per hex and 2 minutes per game turn. Each detailed aircraft counter will represent anywhere from 1 to 5 aircraft.&#10;&#10;The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) player will be on the offensive during this timeframe and have a plethora of diverse aircraft types ranging from obsolete but workhorse B.E.2 2-seaters to brand new aircraft that would become legendary as the war went on such as the SE-5 scout and Bristol F.2a 2-seater. In all the RFC player will have over 15 different types of scout and 2-seater aircraft at their disposal. Pusher type F.E.2b/d and D.H.2 aircraft and the Sopwith Triplane will help fill your arsenal. Sopwith Pups and 1 &frac12; Strutters, Nieuport 17s and SPAD VIIs are some of the other types available. R.E.8s and F.K.8s will help augment your 2-seater fleet and will begin to replace the heavily attrited B.E.2 fleet.&#10;&#10;The German Imperial Air Service player takes on the role of Jagdstaffeln (Jasta) commander utilizing Ace pilots such as the legendary &quot;Red Baron&quot;, Manfred von Richthofen and his Jasta 11 comrades flying Halberstadt and Albatros scout aircraft that terrorized the British 2-seaters during this period. The German player will also have his own 2-seater aircraft such as the Rumpler and Albatros C-class 2-seaters to provide Recon, Bombing and Artillery Cooperation. The battle for the skies over Arras in France 1917 is under your control. Will it be another Bloody April ?&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Terry Simo&#10;MAP, CHARTS &amp; COUNTER ART: Ian Wedge&#10;&#10;",

The square, 5x5 board tile is the island where the war of the gods will take place, with the first row of fields on opposing sides representing the start fields and the rest representing the battlefield. During the game, you will move and stack multiple pieces on top of each other, forming columns and initiating attacks against your opponent. On your turn, you may either move pieces or reincarnate a defeated piece.  You can move a piece 1 field forward, left, or right, but not backwards or diagonally.&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of two moves. One piece can move twice or Two pieces can each move once. When a piece moves into a field with 1 or more already existing pieces, it is always placed directly on top of the other piece(s). Players can also Reincarnate a defeated piece. You do not need to show your opponent it's value. If you move to a field containing an opponent&rsquo;s piece a battle occurs with each player revealing their piece&rsquo;s strength. The weaker of the two is removed from the game. In case of a tie, both pieces stay in the field but only the one in the top can move, blocking their opponent. Also, once a piece has reached an opponent&rsquo;s start field, it may not be moved anymore, neither by you nor by any action of your opponent.&#10;&#10;You win the game by being the first player to build a statue of 5 pieces on an opponent&rsquo;s single start field.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The density of counters in each scenario is low, allowing you to see and experience the big picture of the battle.&#10;&#10;Rebel Fury places you, the player, in the role of the Army Commander (Lee, Burnside, Hooker, Bragg, Rosecrans, Grant).  You maneuver your army to find the enemy&rsquo;s flanks, concentrate your forces for an attack, and determine where to commit your artillery assets.&#10;&#10;Units are portrayed at the Infantry/Cavalry division level. The Civil War Heritage Series game system features a new Zone of Influence/Zone of Control mechanic that controls unit formation (March/Battle) based on their proximity to your opponent. As your units close with the enemy, your forces naturally break into battle formation, where they then maneuver the last distance to engage. Unlike most hex and counter wargames, this system allows you total freedom to move units in any order multiple times, unleashing the full range of historical tactics in a simple and clean format.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 12 hours&#10;Hex: 0.5 mile / 0.8 kilometer&#10;Units: Regiment to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (320 5/8&quot; &amp; 80 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Rulebook&#10;One 24-page Playbook&#10;Two Player Aid TEC/CRT cards&#10;One Union Off-Map Display card&#10;One Game Turn Display card&#10;Two 10-sided dice&#10;One special 6-sided die&#10;Fifteen 4x4&quot; Zip Bags&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-2 hours&#10;&#10;",

Four of the dwarves are simply miners and will mine a particular color of gem, depending on placement.  Gem prices are set each round, cheaper the more dwarves that are mining it.  Players also have two boss dwarves, which can either be shadow dwarves (used to carry out evil actions on other players), or silver dwarves (usually beneficial actions for the player).  Assembling the correct assortment of gems and assigning a silver dwarf to fulfill a contract, he can score either his own contract or one of two open contracts.  Or he can assign a silver dwarf simply to sell gems for cash.  High score when all the contracts are gone wins, but usually someone wins before that happens by hitting 600 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Imagine that you received a few hundred hectares of land anywhere in the world. You carefully exchange any non-indigenous plants with native ones, recreating an environment where a variety of animals can live, including dozens of endangered species. Some of these endangered animals were victims of human violence or were found wounded and many of them were saved from illegal trade. In Sanctuary: Endangered Species, each of you will create a sanctuary for different endangered animal species. With the help of volunteers and rangers you will develop your facility, take care of your animals, and recreate their natural habitat as you try to save them from the impacts of civilization. You will maintain order and monitor animal's behavior &ndash; everything to ensure that the animals in your sanctuary are happy and safe.&#10;&#10;The Sanctuary: Endangered Species is a worker placement game. At the beginning of each round, you lay out a row of cards each of which has a main action and side action. Players take turns placing their workers on those cards in order to perform actions. Each worker &quot;sees&quot; and can perform their main action and  any side actions that are within their line of sight, which is limited by other workers and by obstacles printed on the cards. These actions help you to find new animals and improve their living conditions. The key is to choose the right card at the right moment and to perform your available actions in the most efficient order.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Scenarios, army lists, and full rules for magic and monsters give players the opportunity to command unruly orc warbands, raise armies of the undead, campaign across an antediluvian world as the warchief of a barbarian tribe, or exploit the power of mighty creatures and extraordinary sorcery.&#10;&#10;An army usually consists of 6-8 units comprised of 6-12 individually based figures. These small units move and fight independently, assuming that they follow your orders rather than just doing their own thing. Command and control is just as important on the battlefield as the power of a troll chieftain or the magic of an archmage.&#10;&#10;",

This land is prosperous and a strong city here can easily control the trades between the Etruscan cities of the North and the Greek colonies of the South.

There doesn't exist a better place for a new city!&#10;&#10;The two grandsons of the King of Albalonga &ndash; the twins Romolo and Remo, descendants of Enea of Troy &ndash; don't want to miss an opportunity to dominate the region and, acting against each other, try to establish two cities close to the Tiber river. Their enterprise is not easy as the King of Antemnae and the King of Crustumerium will also fight to dominate this area! Who will prevail?&#10;&#10;In Romolo o Remo?, players act as Kings of the new cities in the Latium and have to compete with each other in order to gain control of the whole Region. Players must manage their kingdom and their growing settlement. Two aspects are crucial: the citizens, as players act with citizens to take many different actions, and the territory, as players can act only in the territories they are able to control &ndash; excluding when they go to war, of course! If the population grows, they can take more actions, but they must feed all of them as well. Money, resources, trades, city buildings, and specialized characters increase a player's possibilites, and soldiers, mercenaries, and war declarations can change the game's storyline at any moment. Who will able to build the strongest city? Who will be the founder of a new civilization &ndash; or perhaps even an Empire?&#10;&#10;",

You want treasure, of course, because what dragon doesn't like shiny bling? You need food as well, though, so pick up a few cattle or sheep along the way to keep your belly full. Grab some armor or shields as treasures from fallen soldiers who thought they could take you down, perhaps put your claws on one fancy ring, and beware cursed items that look nicee but bite your points in the end.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the deck of cards, then divide it into a few smaller decks. One player picks up the first deck, places the top card face up on the table, then passes the deck to the next player. Players keep laying out cards and passing the deck &mdash; with a number of face-up piles equal to the number of players &mdash; but players can also claim one of the piles by placing their dragon figure on it. Once all but one player have claimed a pile, the remaining player takes any cards remaining in the deck along with the final pile. You then grab the next deck and repeat this process until all the decks have been split among the player-dragons.&#10;&#10;Players then compare their hauls, and whoever took the least food is eliminated from the game. (In a five- or six-player game, you separately determine who took the fewest sheep and who took the fewest cattle, with both of those players being eliminated.) The remaining dragons then tally the value of their loot to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

His merchants filled the kingdom with exotic goods such as spices, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Perhaps most famously, Solomon also built the Temple in Jerusalem, a golden place of worship lasting hundreds of years.&#10;&#10;Wisdom of Solomon is a 1-5 player worker placement game taking place during the reign of King Solomon. Players act as Governors for Solomon, sending out workers to gather Resources, build structures, and expand Solomon&rsquo;s influence in the kingdom. The player who curries the most Favor will be crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;The Wisdom of Solomon board is divided into two sections. The section on the right side of the board is a map of Solomon&rsquo;s kingdom where players will build custom houses and roads. As a Governor expands their influence in the land with new roads and houses, that Governor&rsquo;s network will become more powerful and pull Resources from more and more areas. These networks of custom houses will control the flow of Resources in Wisdom of Solomon!&#10;&#10;On the left side of the board is a miniaturized version of the city of Jerusalem. Within this city is the Market area, a region of the city where workers will be sent to buy, sell, and trade Resources and also to play powerful Fortune cards that have been acquired. Elsewhere in Jerusalem is a Foreman who has the plans for building new structures throughout Israel. A Governor can use their Resources to build these structures and create new houses of influence in the kingdom, while granting the Governor new ways to gain Resources and Favor.&#10;&#10;Finally, within the city of Jerusalem a Governor may visit the Levites to help build the Temple of Solomon. Workers send to the Levites can donate Resources to raise this awesome structure and gain great Favor and Fortune! Next to this Temple are the Holy Places, the most sacred of objects that groups of workers may visit and receive great things!&#10;&#10;Wisdom of Solomon ends when a Governor no longer has a Custom House to build or the Temple of Solomon has been completed. When that occurs, the round ends and each person reveals their Temple Tokens. Each Governor tallies their final score and the person having the most Favor wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The time is June 22nd, 1941. Over 3 million German troops are poised on the Russian border preparing to launch Operation Barbarossa! What was supposed to be a quick campaign ended up marking the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;From Award Winning designer, Art Lupinacci, Russia Besieged covers the entire German campaign in the east from 1941 to the bitter end, in 1945. One of the finest Army/Corps level games on the market, Russia Besieged Deluxe edition has been overhauled from years of experience and nuances discovered in Tournament play, to bring you a richly detailed, east front experience you expect to see from this classic wargame.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Two large maps cover the territory from Berlin to Archangel to Astrakhan down to Bucharest, all to accommodate 5/8&rdquo; counters! Rich in design features, the game simulates unit breakdowns, surrounded cities, Blitzkrieg attacks, a double impulse movement and attack system, two impulse turns, multi-weather turns and much, much more.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;As the German player, you experience many of the challenges experienced by the German commanders on the Eastern Front. Do you channel your forces to Leningrad? Push for Moscow? Or go for the oil rich regions of the Caucasus Mountains? All a tough call as each looks attainable, if you only had another couple of units more on the map!&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Early victories quickly change to difficult advances to the point where you make that fateful decision to go on the strategic withdrawal to fend off defeat. Or not! Sudden Death Victory conditions can be met at any time during the struggle.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;As the Russian player, the first year of the war is a nail-biter! German troops pour deep into Russia as you husband your forces to blunt the most dangerous attacks, giving up ground grudgingly as you pray for the early onset of Winter. Snow brings respite and fresh forces. But, the relief is short lived as the warm weather of 1942 brings new challenges. A rejuvenated German Army, a shadow of the initial invasion force, is still a force to be reckoned with! Unable to attack everywhere, the German will marshal his panzers and push where he feels success will bring decisive victory. Can you stop him!&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Russia Besieged is a multi-layered game experience that includes not only pushing counters on the map, players must also take into account their side&rsquo;s War Economy. The Russian player must deal with production of troops and oil to rebuild depleted forces while the German is on a constant struggle with replacement points to rebuild a proper mix of units to defeat the Red Horde!&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Can you do better than the historical counterparts? Play the game and challenge yourself!&#10;&#10;",

From prickling hot sensation came the grand idea for this sweet game.&#10;&#10;Sweet &amp; Spicy is a bluffing card game for 2-6 players and the kid-friendly variant of Spicy. Instead of Wasabi you can now play with Lemon and there is a new card in the game: The SUPER-JOKER. But the game principle remains the same.&#10;&#10;Just like in Spicy, the cards are played face down, so you can cheat when you announce your card. But it's not just about bluffing convincingly. You can almost always play a card that is at least half right if you play it skillfully from your hand. It's a matter of tactically considering which card you can get away with: Do I play a &quot;pepper 9&quot; better than a &quot;chili 10&quot; or a suit joker than a &quot;pepper 10&quot;? Or do I pass better, because I'm sure it will be noticeable that I've been thinking about it for so long?&#10;&#10;In Sweet &amp; Spicy, the super joker is added, which can be any spice and any number. It is therefore always correct and cannot be doubted.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

New roads have been built in the kingdom, with a new city founded at their meeting point which has grown so much that the King has decided to move the capital there and build a new castle.&#10;&#10;Numerous corporations of craftsmen were already present in the city, but now guilds are forming, which are larger and more wide-ranging, powerful and in competition with one another. With the goal of obtaining favor with the King, the guilds will gather together the most prestigious personages within them, not to mention those who can bring the largest influx of money or useful talent.&#10;&#10;What better place than the central square to find new members? For this reason, each guild places its tents in the central square every week, inviting the persons it considers most interesting to sign up by incentivizing them with precious gifts. This is certainly not a low-cost operation considering that it can cost many pieces of silver to put together the most convincing gift.&#10;&#10;At the same time, each guild must build its headquarters, spending large amounts of gold to enlarge it with a range of luxurious rooms suitable for its members; if this were not enough, the guilds must also take into account the King's current tastes on what is most important for a guild worthy of his approval.&#10;&#10;Will you manage to make your guild stand out so that it becomes the most important in the city?

    "Description": "&quot;Carrier Battle: Philippine Sea&quot; is a solitaire simulation of the largest carrier battle in history, fought during the invasion of Saipan (June, 1944). As the U.S. commander, you maneuver your task forces and conduct air searches in a tension-packed contest to find the Japanese carriers before they locate and attack yours.  Simple game mechanics control Japanese movement and determine the timing and strengths of their attacks. You will not know that a Japanese air strike is headed your way until it is detected by radar and you scramble your fighters to intercept.&#10;&#10;The game has a total of nine scenarios.   Four learning scenarios take you through the rules by programmed instruction using slices of the real battle.  The other five are full-scale, fully replayable games.  These include one-day scenarios for each day of the action, a two-day scenario for the whole battle, a hypothetical scenario presuming different US plans, and a hypothetical scenario in which Midway was never fought and the Japanese come armed with the full Pearl Harbor striking force.&#10;&#10;Carrier Battle: Philippine Sea is based on Carrier: The Southwest Pacific Campaign &#226;&#128;&#147; 1942-1943 (Victory Games, 1990) but is a new, standalone wargame.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In The Isle of Cats Duel &mdash; a competitive, standalone game designed specifically for two players &mdash; you are citizens of Squalls End on a rescue mission to the Isle of Cats and must save as many cats as possible before the evil Lord Vesh arrives. Each cat is represented by a unique tile and belongs to a family; you must find a way to make them all fit on your boat while keeping families together.&#10;&#10;The Isle of Cats Duel replaces the card drafting from the original The Isle of Cats game with a new movement system. Guided by an Oshax cat, players take turns moving around the island. Where you move determines which cats, treasures, and lessons you can access and will shape the options available to your opponent on their next turn.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who best balances rescuing cats, completing lessons, and limiting their opponent's options will prove themselves as the ultimate cat rescuer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dark Horse is a board game set in the Wild West with an average playing time of 30 to 90 minutes. The game puts one to four players in the role of a unique character in charge of a small territory in the old west. Some examples of the characters in the game are Banker, Cowboy, and Tracker. The characters have various abilities that give them advantages in the game as well as a starting bonus of some sort. Each player collects and uses various resources to build towns, cities, and rails to grow their territories. Players start the game with one city and two towns with the goal of growing out their territories to include additional towns, cities, and railroad connections throughout the areas that they control. The objective of the game is to collect the most victory points when the game ends. Players do this by expanding their territory, collecting gold, and obtaining Influence Points from certain actions on the game board. Players will need to watch each other&rsquo;s progress as the game can end in several different ways.&#10;&#10;Summary of Play&#10;Each turn players roll two colored dice and place those dice on a specific action on the game board. The game has built in actions and tokens that allow players to manipulate their dice in certain ways. So players will have to decide whether to use these actions or limited tokens such as the Wild Die tokens to modify their dice. This allows players to use a majority of the dice rolls that come up each turn to further improve their position in the game.&#10;&#10;The game promotes fast play as each player takes turns placing one or more dice on only one action per turn. Actions can include but are not limited to drawing cards, collecting resources, building additional towns and cities, and taking special actions such as the Sheriff, Mayor, Trader, or Tycoon. Some actions, such as Rail Baron, require a certain natural die roll while other actions require that your dice add up to a certain value. Players gain influence points during the game by taking specific actions which counts for a players overall victory points needed at the end of the game. Players will also need to focus on building their railroad connections as efficiently as they can to maximize their score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with a hand of random flower cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of flower in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of flower, so if you must plant a type of flower that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest flowers, you receive coins based on the number of cards in that field and the &quot;meter&quot; for that particular type of flower. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;",
