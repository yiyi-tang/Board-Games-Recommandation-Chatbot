But the men of the 13th Independent Battalion won&rsquo;t let go of the ridge without a fight.&#10;&#10;In this mini-campaign, command either beleaguered American infantry, under constant attack and cut off from their heavy artillery, or lead Japanese troops in ferocious attacks up the slopes of Kakazu Ridge.&#10;&#10;Historically, the American companies were decimated and thrown back, but not without mauling the Japanese battalion that faced them.  How will you fare?&#10;&#10;Kakazu Ridge is a 3-scenario mini-campaign portraying small-unit infantry combat during the Battle of Okinawa.  It has been written for A Sergeant&rsquo;s War, but can easily be adapted to other WWII rules sets.&#10;&#10;The campaign includes:&#10;&#10;     Historical background, with maps and contemporary pictures&#10;     Campaign special rules&#10;     3 linked scenarios, with overall victory determined by holding terrain, overrunning the enemy, and inflicting casualties&#10;     A painting tutorial for 15mm Japanese infantry&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Across the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the North Sea, two powerful navies battled for supremacy, a life-and-death struggle that resonated throughout the twentieth century.&#10;&#10;King &amp; Kaiser includes half a dozen scenarios from the early years of World War I. &#10;Take on the role of Spee, Beatty, Hipper, or Admiral Sir John Jellicoe: the only man who could lose the war in an afternoon. &#10;Also included are 160 individual ship cards from over 50 different classes of the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine, along with every major warship in the service of the Austro-Hungarian navy during the Great War.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to keep the German threat bottled up at Kiel, making the seas safe for democracy? &#10;Or can you break the back of the Grand Fleet and provide for the German Empire her place in the sun?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Black cards represent rooms, which are added one at a time using special &quot;docking&quot; requirements.  Red cards represent either treasures or monsters: even-numbered cards are treasures and odd-numbered cards are monsters.&#10;&#10;In addition, rooms, treasures and monsters are classified as either Physical or Psychic.  Clubs and Hearts are Physical, while Spades and Diamonds are Psychic.  Two of the dice are used as point trackers for Physical and Psychic attributes.&#10;&#10;To win the game you must explore each room and defeat each monster without running out of either attribute.&#10;&#10;Each card has a description given in the Card Guide.  Here are examples to give an idea of the flavor:&#10;&#10;&quot;4: Room of Eerie Whistling: The walls are covered in what looks like ancient paper wasp nests. Wind blows out of the holes in keening chords.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;9: Cloaked Man: A human in a black cloak. The cloak bursts apart, for it is actually the wing covers of a huge insect. The head unfolds as two spiky legs, and a glow-eyed face with huge mandibles raises up with a horrible hissing noise.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;8: Grimoire of Abjuration: A text to rebuke evil spirits in the strongest terms possible.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Rules and Card Guide will be given in the Files section.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Although savage creatures like orcs barely comprehend fear, that is not to suggest this barbaric people does not understand their own mortality. Such notions are instilled in their culture by the bone shamans, enigmatic and revered figures at the heart of each tribe.&#10;&#10;Bone shamans converse with the souls of the dead through ritualistic ceremonies born of fire and blood, their eyes flooded by visions gifted by past warlords and shamans. Their words are sacrosanct omens none dare to ignore, for to earn the ire of a bone shaman is to invite nothing but death.&#10;&#10;Rattlebone is a visionary of unlimited potential, her voice carrying prophesies not only of the chieftains of old, but the Ascended themselves. Her supplicants wage war across the Burnt Isle, seeking Godtears to gift to their revered figurehead, each shard increasing her power tenfold.

By regaining possession of Sardinia, the Romans were better able to control the western Mediterranean, and able to gain access to Sardinian wheat, which was used to feed their growing armies. One similarity between Hannibal and Ampsicora was that after their defeats, their cities of origin&mdash;Carthage and Cornus, respectively, were razed by the Romans.&#10;&#10;A copy of Centuria is required to use this supplement.&#10;&#10;",

Can you hit the jackpot and win the payout?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In Jackpot Payout, each player receives the same starting hands of cards and a play mat. A display area of cards that can be obtained is placed within reach of all players. On a player's turn, the player will draw the top 3 cards from their hand of shuffled cards and place them on the 3 areas of their player mat. The mat represents 3 reels of a slot machine.&#10;&#10;If a player gets 3 matching cards, they hit the jackpot! Those cards are placed in the player's score pile. Cards will have coins on them in addition to symbols and special text. As the cards with coins enter the score piles, these cards can no longer be played, but they count towards the player's total score.&#10;&#10;Once a player receives 12 coins, the game end is triggered and a final round takes places where players have an opportunity to chain jackpots together!&#10;&#10;If a player does not hit a jackpot, they may take a card from the display and that card as well as the rest of the cards in hand are discarded.

The players are rival leaders competing to build and visit locations. As the city grows, more actions become available, but players must race to claim the diminishing real estate. Specialists can be hired, granting powerful abilities to combo and enhance player actions. Points are awarded for locations, specialists, and the diversity of factions represented. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;You and your rival take in turns placing workers on the border locations of the city. Where your workers intersect you place additional workers - place them on empty spaces to build new locations there, or on existing locations to perform new and powerful actions. Instead of placing a worker, you can recall all of your workers to perform the action of those spaces, including harvesting resources, building locations for new actions, and hiring specialists to improve productivity.&#10;&#10;All cards that you build and hire are worth points. You gain bonus points for sets of different factions, building adjacent to other factions, and increasing the city&rsquo;s population. As the name suggests, diversity is key to victory and becoming the new mayor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Animals from Langland meet again in Langland Domino, a classic game with the Langland twist: no numbers, but cute animals. In the game 2 to 4 players aged 4 an up try to get rid of all their animal tiles first. To do so, they have to continue or complete animals on the table. If they complete an animal, they get to lie another tile immediately. The special corner pieces not only have the ever-growing line of animals stay on the table, but also grant an extra turn. As soon as a player got rid of all tiles or cannot lay out any of their tiles anymore, the game ends and the player with the least tiles left, wins.&#10;&#10;As all games in the Langland line of games, Langland Domino takes a classic and makes it accessible fun for kids. An appealing display of long animals, and simple tactical decisions are the highlights of this visit to Langland.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Mary will have to find these to bring everything back to normal. In the game, players try to find the magnetic pieces of clothing, shown on a face-up search card, by moving the magnetic Mary figure onto any item. To search more effectively players also have to remember which items turned out to be non-magnetic. Whoever collects the most enchanted (i.e., magnetic) items wins.&#10;&#10;Mary Magica is a cutely themed and illustrated, mag(net)ical spin on memory games for kids aged 3 and up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

No knowledge of LARP or Empire is required to play or enjoy the game.&#10;&#10;Players represent fabulously wealthy members of the Bloody Butchers Guild of Temeschwar who are seeking to acquire the most prestigious artifacts associated with the Butchers Guild.  Players make sealed bids for Artifact Cards which are revealed in turn, each with a Prestige value ranging from 1-9. Three Banker Cards (featuring Lorenzo La Volpe von Temeschwar, The Master of The Butchers Bank, who was the in-character designer of the game) are shuffled into the deck of Artifact Cards; the game ends when the third Banker Card is revealed.  There is no limit to the amount that players can bid, although whoever has spent the most at the end of the game loses.  The winner is whoever of the remaining players has the most Prestige from the artifacts they have bought.&#10;&#10;The unlimited bidding mechanic was inspired by that used in Q.E. and Tony's Treasures.&#10;&#10;The game is presented in a hand-crafted wooden box which matches those of other games by The Guild of Good Games in the LARP world of Empire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Here is your free introduction to All Units Engage!&#10;&#10;All Units Engage is a set of simple rules for skirmish games for two or more players. Play can be based around a handful of minis or include multiple squads. &#10;The game plays equally well with 15mm or 28mm miniatures.&#10;&#10;All Units Engage is a solid &ldquo;old school&rdquo; game with a modern perspective. It is a game that flows very well from turn-to-turn and player to player. &#10;Games are intended to be short, with an emphasis on achieving objectives inside of a brief span of turns.&#10;&#10;All Units Engage is a toolkit that invites you to play with the minis and models you already own. &#10;The focus is on sci-fi, near-future and post-apocalyptic gaming, but the mechanics are flexible enough to support a wider variety of settings such as Cold War and even WWII.&#10;&#10;All Units Engages uses ten-sided dice. &#10;No templates are required and only a few basic markers are needed to track pins and reserve actions.&#10;&#10;All Units Engage is casual, but complete. This introduction is only a taste of what AUE has to offer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If necessary you could also use card counters.&#10;&#10;Minimal bookkeeping is required because Markers or Tokens are used to indicate the status of aircraft during the game. Furthermore you do not need to use a hex mat.&#10;&#10;The capabilities of aircraft within the game have been calculated, taking a common aircraft type of average performance as the base line, in this case the Albatros D.III. All other aircraft capabilities relate to how they compare with this aircraft. It is possible that the performance of this or that aircraft might not match your expectations based on anecdotal evidence. We make no apology for this as we are not trying to create a simulation. The resulting data has been kept to a simple format, which enables a Player to control several aircraft during a game, and the overall gaming experience will be improved if multiple Players attempt to &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo; on each side.&#10;&#10;The abilities of pilots and crew are represented by having Skill Factors. These determine how well they fly their aircraft, their chances of hitting the target when shooting, and avoiding serious damage if their own aircraft is hit. Pilot skill is vitally important in air combat, and Players will need to learn where to position their best pilots, as well as to protect their novice aviators . In the case of aircraft with several crew members, Skill is determined for the crew as a whole. You do not need to keep track of individual crew.&#10;&#10;To carry out any action other than level flight requires the expenditure of one or more Orders, which may also require a successful Skill Test. Orders are generated each turn and better leaders generally mean more Orders. &#10;While air combat is probably what most players will want play, there are also rules for Ground Attack, Bombing, Photo Reconnaissance and Balloon Busting.&#10;&#10;Altitude represented during the game assumes that the main combat is taking place in roughly the same area of the sky, and it is possible to climb or dive to gain an advantage, or try to escape.&#10;&#10;Players alternate the activation of their aircraft. Optional Tactical Cards can be used during the game to provide additional detail.&#10;&#10;Data is provided for most aircraft that were in action during the First World War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Grendha: Origins Expansion is the prequel of Grendha: Search for Lost Triumphs. The Origins is a wondrous story of Arnorus's fight between vicious predators of Meru and with his confederates Mirgoth, Kondu, and Genu. Grendha: Origins gives a sneak-peek into both Arnorus and Meru's past. This addon is a standalone game and an entirely co-op/solo gameplay for 1-4 players.&#10;The game starts with the exploration of arnoru with his allies to dominate the planet Meru. Four heroes combine their strength to destroy the creatures on the planet. The territories have a strange connection with one another, to capture an area, the four heroes should explore and find the territories which are interconnected. The dangerous creatures have many odd powers that can only be defeated by great strategy. The primary power source of each dangerous monsters lies in different territories. The clue for destroying each creature lies within the hands of many wizards and witches. You have to draw each event card in the time of gameplay to see the clues hidden.&#10;&#10;Attacking a territory and conquering it doesn't mean the dangerous monsters are fully annihilated. They can always come back, so spend your energy wisely before you exhaust. The provinces on the planet have many mysterious behaviours. By using the combination of technology, magic, weapons, and armies, you should dominate the planet.&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview:&#10;The four warriors start from their home base. An event card is used to see the current situation of the planet. The event cards will tell how crucial it is to make a journey to any territories. For example, the event of the day states that now there is heavy rainfall, which causes you to exhaust your energy two times more than your usual travel. The event card will also indicate the connection of the territory with another territory. There will be certain symbols for showing the links of territories.&#10;&#10;Green skull symbol: shows a connection with one territory.&#10;Orange Skull Symbol: Shows a connection with two territories.&#10;Red Skull symbol: shows a connection with three territories.&#10;&#10;To destroy a monster in a territory A, the players should place their diplomacy card or resistance card(depends on the type of monster you are dealing with) in the linked territory to diffuse their mysterious power. For example, if Arnoru have to destroy a monster in the territory 'A,' which is of green skull symbol, the other warrior should place his diplomacy card or resistance Card in the other territory 'C.' If its done, Arnoru can give a perfect strike to the monster, and the beast will destroy.&#10;If there is only one player, The player should deploy his Resistance or diplomacy card in multiple territories and should target the regions he/she should attack later.&#10;Thus you should capture the celestial city and make the planet Meru a real heaven.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;That night, the earth shook. The ruins of an unknown civilization appeared but the earth's crust continued to tear apart, causing natural disasters all over the planet. Strange seismic impulses seemed to come from a temple within these unexplored ruins.&quot;&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;Maztec comes with 28 &quot;game turn&quot; pieces, 38 &ldquo;gem&rdquo; pieces and 4 &quot;temple&quot; pieces: &#10;The four &quot;temple&rdquo; pieces represent 4 parts of the entrance to the temple. &#10;The &quot;gem&quot; pieces are of two different colors. The front shows a red or green gem with 3 or 4 symbols. The back shows a gray gem and two continuous pattern lines.  &#10;Each &quot;game turn&quot; piece is numbered from 1 to 28 on the back. The front reveals 1 symbol on the decor background of the temple.&#10;&#10;Overview and purpose of the game&#10;Welcome Adventurers! As an expert archaeologist of ancient civilizations, you have been commissioned by governments around the world to solve the temple enigma of this strange civilization.  &#10;After a trying journey, you approach these ruins. A camp has been set up. A strange temple with an entrance marked by two red crystals invites you to enter. Carefully, you enter this temple and feel terrible tremors around you. But you're brave and courageous, and you decide to continue as planned. &#10;As you explore the place, you discover new symbols. You also gather strange green and red gems surrounded by these symbols. These symbols appear to be clues that allow these stones to be placed in the right locations within this temple, by uniting them. After placing back a crystal, the tremors seem to be less important.  &#10;But the earth is shaking again. That&rsquo;s right. These crystals must be placed back as quickly as possible within the temple in order to permanently stop the seismic waves coming from this temple!&#10;You'll investigate why this is all happening once the challenge is faced, the problem solved.&#10;Only the  sharpest minds can solve the enigma behind these stones. It is now your turn... But time is running out... And if you can solve the enigma of thsi temple, you can finally declaim: MAZTEC!&#10;&#10;Elements of the game&#10;&ldquo;Game turn&rdquo; pieces: On the back, the number of the turn of play, and on the front, an element of the temple with a mysterious symbol. &#10;Temple:  the starting point for exploration. This temple is to be assembled at the beginning of the game, already shows you 2 symbols. It is made of 4 pieces.&#10;&ldquo;Gem&rdquo; pieces: On the back is a gray gem. Beneath this gem are drawn 2 lines of patterns. On the front is a red or green gem framed by 3 or 4 symbols on the front. These symbols allow you to form combinations by juxtaposing them. But the combination is only successful if confirmed by the perfect combination of patterns on the back of these pieces. The &quot;gem&quot; pieces also have a small &quot;spiral&quot; symbol (a sort of deception maker) located at the top left of each piece allowing you to always put them in the right way.&#10;&#10;Setting up&#10;It is necessary to assemble the entrance to the 4-room temple in the first place. You then have to form 3 stacks of parts: A stack of &quot;game turn&quot; parts, sorted from 1 to 28. Number 1 is visible at the top of the stack. And 2 stacks of &quot;gem&quot; pieces must be formed: a stack per gem color, gray gem on a visible blue background. At the beginning of the game, you have to reveal 2 gems below each &quot;gem&quot; stack.&#10;&#10;Each player also picks 2 &quot;gem&quot; pieces in the stacks: 1 red gem and 1 green gem per player that he places with the front visible before him. &#10;Solo mode: The one player 2 red gems and 2 green gems that he places in front of him.&#10;&#10;Course of the game&#10;The last player player to feel an earthquake begins.&#10;Game turn: &#10;The first player will pick a &quot;game turn&quot; piece and add it to the temple. It bears the number &quot;1&quot; on it. This begins the exploration and reveals a new symbol. At the beginning of each round, each player will pick a &quot;game turn&quot; piece. &#10;Possible moves during a player's turn:  &#10;- select 1 gem piece from the 4 visible ones and draw one of the same color to replace it. If there are no more gems to draw, replenish the pickaxes with discarded gems if there are any. &#10;- discard the 2 pieces of the pile of green or red gems and replace them with 2 others, then select 1 of the 2. &#10;    With the selected gem, you can:  &#10;    - place it on the temple by combining it, &#10;- add it to a gem or to a combination of gems from an opponent (except in a solo   game)&#10;    - add it to one of its gems to create a combination. &#10;If no placement is possible, the player places the piece in front of him. &#10;If a placement is successful, the player may try again to place or combine the pieces in his possession as long as his placement attempts succeed, at an opponent&rsquo;s (except in a solo game) or on his/her pieces. &#10;Last possible move: the player can try to place a combination of his/her gems on the temple. It is then the next player&rsquo;s turn (or the next turn in a solo game).&#10;&#10;Bonus move:&#10;At any time, the player can secretly (without revealing it to other players) return his/her gems to observe lines that can help him assemble the pieces.&#10;&#10;End of the game and goal&#10;&#10;&rdquo;If not all of the gems are placed in the temple before 28 turns... The end is near.&rdquo;&#10;Competitive mode: If all the gems have been placed, it is the first player who no longer has any gem to place who wins the game. &#10;Collaborative mode: If all the gems have been placed, your team wins the game.&#10;Solo mode: If all the gems have been placed before 28 turns, you win the game.&#10;&#10;If all the gems have not been placed, after 28 turns, the first player who no longer has any gems, or any more combination of gems in front of him, or who has the least, wins the game. &#10;Must-know: a combination of gem not assembled in the temple counts as a single gem. &#10;However, humanity will only be saved if all gems are correctly placed before the 28 turns.&#10;&#10;",

The advantages lay with the defender and that made the attacks costly and time consuming. Often both sides seemed to be in a quagmire that sapped morale and destroyed equipment and devoured manpower. In the end, the Allies prevailed, but their sacrifice, valor and victory were overshadowed by the D-Day landings and the campaigns in France and Germany.&#10;&#10;This game system is fast to learn, fun to play and reflective of the realities of warfare of the Second World War. The user will not have to invest in large armies or costly terrain pieces. With a little skill and some imagination players will be able to recreate and reenact some of the most difficult kinds of combat faced by American GI's, the Canadian Armed Services and the famous British Tommies.

    "Description": "In the 17th Century, three English civil wars produced a new and truly Great Britain. In the first and second wars (1648-49), supporters of King Charles I clashed with the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war (1649-51) pitted supporters of King Charles II against supporters of the Rump Parliament. It all ended with the execution of King Charles I, the exile of his son, King Charles II, and the shifting of the seat of government power. The outcomes of these battles are well documented, but what would be different had the troops of King Charles II prevailed at the Battle of Worcester or if Sir John Hotham failed to keep Charles I from entering Hull? &#10;Pike Hack: The Road to Dunbar may have some plausible answers.&#10;&#10;In this fun and fast-paced game, players use D-10 dice for casualty and morale calculations and D-6 dice for additional movement (evades and pursuits). The D-10 system for casualty and morale eliminates the endless modifiers that tend to make each move a monotonous chore. &#10;Basing figures, a common practice in many other popular game systems, is not essential to Pike Hack: The Road to Dunbar, since movement and engagements are based on numerical and figurative representations. For example, the system allows for infantry ranging from six to twelve figures and cavalry from four to ten figures; both are representations of much larger forces. &#10;Players are not, however, limited to small representations, as the game is designed to accommodate complete armies.&#10;&#10;An added wrinkle in this system is the use of directional dice for command control and first artillery fire. We found that the use of directional dice for these functions keeps the game streamlined, fast-paced, realistic and fun.&#10;&#10;The appendix contains tactical information, color illustrations to better explain tactics, and four pages of suggested army compositions. Because there are several different types of units, players are also provided with sample army lists and blank templates for composing custom lists.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are 4 different colours based on CMYK Colour and Black(K)can represent any colour.&#10;&#10;During the game, the Player will go through 3 phases. &#10;First is the Player's phase whereby he or she is given 3 actions to either: &#10;A) Draw 1 card from TOWER deck &#10;B) Put 1 card from hand into play &#10;C) Discard 2 identical cards from hand to destroy target enemy AMMO. &#10;Player can repeat the same action as long as 3 actions are fulfilled.&#10;&#10;Second is the Special Event Phase whereby he or she will roll a 6-sided dice to determine one of the Special event to occur.&#10;&#10;Third is the Enemy Phase whereby the Player will count and receive the total number of damage dealt by all the CANNONs in play&#10;&#10;Player repeats each phase for multiple rounds until all the enemy CANNONs in play are destroyed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
