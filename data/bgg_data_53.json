    "Description": "While Farmer Henry is enjoying red wine in his newly-built colossal basement, the piggies in the barn are also partying for fun! Impish as they are, they're really organized when it comes to forming groups for games. Recruit your team carefully, but not too slowly!&#10;&#10;Pick-a-Dog (first published as Formissimo) features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Pig, with the only difference being that dog noses in one game are replaced with piggie snouts in the other. An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined they support up to eight players.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, light/dark, one/two arms, with/without sunglasses, and with/without popcorn. (As noted above, combining the two games adds a sixth attribute: pig/dog nose.) Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot;. The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card (two cards when playing with 6-8). If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;Whoever has collected the most cards when the game ends wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fernando Pessoa (13 June 1888 - 30 November 1935) was a Portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher, and philosopher and has been described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets of all times. Pessoa was a prolific writer &mdash; and not only under his own name because he created approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them all pseudonyms because he felt that some did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them heteronyms.&#10;&#10;In Pessoa, you are one of Pessoa&rsquo;s most famous heteronyms &mdash; Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis, &Aacute;lvaro de Campos, and Bernardo Soares &mdash; and move between the metaphysical space of Pessoa's head and the physical spaces of Lisbon to gain inspiration from the iconic caf&eacute;s, visit bookshops to expand your library and knowledge, and seek inspiration to write poems, thereby scoring victory points. Whoever has the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, Pessoa is a worker-placement game with special rules in which players can place their heteronyms since each player is a different heteronym, but all players are also the same physical person, that is Fernando Pessoa.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two modules that can be switched on and off as the players wish. If you play with only the base game, Pessoa fares well as an advanced family game with straightforward rules, but interesting decisions and a more tactical nature. With the modules, Pessoa becomes a more crunchy game, in which extra layers of strategy combine to offer you a rich experience that tries to shine light on the complex figure that Fernando Pessoa was.&#10;&#10;The game's rulebook includes historical notes to explain how theme and mechanisms are interconnected, providing you an accurate historical background about this extraordinary poet and his metaphysical creations that had their own personality and writing style: his heteronyms. We hope that at the end of your first game, we have spiked your interest to learn more about Fernando Pessoa and his poetry.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bloc by Bloc: The Insurrection Game is a semi-cooperative tabletop game inspired by 21st century protest movements, riots and popular uprisings. Each player controls a faction of revolutionaries&mdash;Workers, Students, Neighbors, or Prisoners&mdash;fighting against the State in the streets of a city that change with each game. Build barricades, clash with riot cops, occupy districts, loot shopping centers, and liberate the city before time runs out and the military arrives! Bloc by Bloc features hidden agendas, deep strategy, area control, asymmetrical player abilities, and a special method for randomly generating billions of unique city layouts. Bloc by Bloc 2nd edition features brand new art, streamlined gameplay, improved components and new objectives for the insurrection!&#10;&#10;The game lasts up to 10 rounds. Each round is 1 night and each night has 2 phases. During the Nighttime phase, each player takes a turn: 3-5 actions followed by a police response that is controlled by the Police Ops deck and the level of Police Morale. Each player starts with 2 blocs in the city and can add more throughout the game. On a player's turn, they roll dice and take one action (such as looting, occupying, attacking, or barricading) for each die rolled with 1+ of their blocs. Players may use loot cards to enhance their actions. After all factions have taken their turns, the Sunrise phase begins, which is when police go on the attack and factions have a chance to liberate districts.&#10;&#10;The police and the State are the common enemies of all factions. Factions must build occupations in all of their own districts for the social insurrection to be successful. However, each faction also has its own secret agenda with a set of specific tasks that faction must complete in order to win the game. The majority of factions will have Social Agendas and they must cooperate to win the game together. But some factions may have Vanguardist or Nihilist Agendas that secretly pit them against the social insurrection. These factions can only win the game alone!&#10;&#10;",

The game goes over five rounds giving a scoring after the 1st, 3rd and 5th round. Victory points are awarded for majorities of allocated buildings (very similar to the original game Alhambra). To get the buildings you roll 8 dice each showing the six building-symbols. Each player has 3 rolls on his turn to get as many similar symbols as possible (up to a max of 8). A player can only note his result for one type of building. The results of the dice rolls from every player is marked on the game board. So everybody can compare his dice rolls with those of the other players. After a round is completed the player with the highest dice-roll can choose between 2 buildings of the respective category or 1 building and a special counter giving a certain bonus. (Bonuses can be: additional 1-3 VPs, extra dice-roll,  exchange one building, determine Starting player, etc.) The second best player in that category will get the other part. Each round has a certain number of turns depending on how many players are playing (3, 4 or 5 turns). So, because a player can only hit one type of building during his turn, he cannot score all 6 types of buildings in a single round. After round #1, #3 and #5 the majority in each building category is awarded the same way like in Alhambra. The player with the most VP's wins the game.&#10;&#10;Special: There is a variant in which you can combine the building counters of the Alhambra game which adds some building strategy.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Gardens of Alhambra is an abstract influence game from Dirk Henn where each player is represented by plants of a particular color.  Using tiles with all four colors on them, the players place them onto the board in fixed locations.  In doing so, they try to surround victory point markers and capture them.  Of course, since each tile has all of the player's colors represented, every tile placement must be carefully thought-out so that you maximize your points while minimizing them for your opponents.  Ties disqualify players - and so the next highest color total will earn the points.  The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tunisia II is an Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing covering the campaign in Northwest Africa from November 1942 through May 1943.&#10;&#10;This new edition is similar to the original 1995 Tunisia game from The Gamer&#039;s, but features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and new maps. The tempo of play is just outstanding, beginning with just a few units in play. Over the next few months both sides rapidly reinforce the theater. The build-up culminates with Rommel&rsquo;s offensive at Kasserine and tension over the variable entry of Montgomery&rsquo;s 8th Army. This climax is followed by the slow destruction of Axis forces in North Africa.&#10;&#10;The upgrade of this game involved a handful of important decisions. A straight reprint was out of the question, since the original was designed back when the OCS v2 rulebook was fairly new. In Tunisia II we standardize how the game should be played with the latest series rules, and also have updated it to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; better with newer OCS games. So units and rules have been changed to conform to games also set in 1942-43: DAK II, Case Blue, and Sicily II. Recent work on Beyond the Rhine is also factored in.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters - includes replacement counters for Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe [16] and Korea: The Forgotten War [4])&#10;One 56-page OCS Series Rules v4.2 rules booklet&#10;One 24-page Tunisia II specific rules booklet&#10;Two 4-sided OCS v4.2 Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two Player Aid unit arrival cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-50 Hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simple racing game where speed and movement is decided by the driver and not the dice. Only when exceeding safety speeds on the bends are dice used to decide the penalty incurred.&#10;&#10;The players use &quot;dashboards&quot;, cardboard cutouts resembling dashboards, complete with a speedometer and tire and brake wear gauges.  Maximum acceleration is fixed, tire and brake wear may happen as a result of cornering too quickly&mdash;then there are the dreaded spinouts.  A few tight spots exist, so blocking is also an effective tactic.&#10;Tactic cards (you get 5 for the entire race) put a few aces up your sleeve.  They can give you an extra burst of speed or of cornering ability.&#10;&#10;Pit stops will get you fresh brakes and tires but you must reach them by exact count&mdash;otherwise you're forced into another lap.  Also, pit cards throw a monkeywrench in&mdash;usually you'll lose a turn, but now and then you'll get extra fast service, a burst of speed in coming out of the pit, or special brakes good for one extra corner.&#10;&#10;The race runs for up to 10 laps; the player furthest past the finish line when all players have had the same number of turns wins.&#10;The game's simplicity makes it accessible to younger players, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The Table Battles system is a light battle game that recreates battles throughout human history with broad strokes and an emphasis on playability. Players roll and allocate dice to Unit cards, with each card accepting specific die results or dice combinations. On a later turn, those dice are removed to activate the Unit and attack an enemy formation, removing wooden pieces assigned to the formation in question. But the enemy may be able to screen the attack (cancelling it), counterattacking (inflicting extra losses on the attacker), or absorb it via a strategic reserve. In fact, in most cases, the enemy MUST do so if they're able to. The result is a tense cat-and-mouse game in which both players make feints and counterfeints, looking for an advantage and acting decisively once it presents itself.&#10;&#10;In this base game, there are eight different scenarios and 84 different formations. The battles included are:&#10;&#10;     Bosworth, 1485&#10;     Ivry, 1590&#10;     White Mountain, 1620&#10;     Marston Moor, 1644&#10;     Battle of the Dunes, 1658&#10;     Malplaquet, 1705&#10;     Plains of Abraham, 1759&#10;     Brooklyn Heights, 1776&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Match half donuts for cash and full donuts to score. Fry up a tasty win today!&#10;&#10;To set up the game, place four 1x1 starting tiles on the 6x6 game board that represents your donut shop and take five &quot;dollar&quot; tiles from the bag; on their backside, dollar tiles have either a half donut (plain, chocolate, sprinkle) or a set of donut holes (again in the three flavors). The starting tiles depict half donuts in these three flavors&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can purchase a 1x4 donut tile that depicts half donuts along its edges from the six available tiles for a cost of $0-5. You then add this tile to your shop &mdash; with some of the tile hanging off the edge of the board if you wish &mdash; ideally lining up the half donuts on that tile with those already on your board. If you make a matching donut, i.e., putting two sprinkle halves together, then you take a sprinkle scoring token; if you make a non-matching donut, i.e. a plain half combined with a chocolate half, then you draw a dollar tile from the supply bag. Note, however, that jelly donuts give no dollar tile if paired with a non-jelly donut because who in the world would reward something like that?&#10;&#10;To end your turn, you can place a dollar tile on your shop board to complete a donut (and score) or fill a space with donut holes (which might also score). Additionally, you can serve a customer in line by offering them scoring tokens that match their desired donuts, which will earn you more points than the tokens on their own.&#10;&#10;When one player has filled every space in their shop or the donut tiles run out, the game ends, with you scoring for satisfied customers, neighborhoods served, donuts still on hand, and donut hole pairs in the shop, while losing points for empty spaces in your shop. The player with the highest score clearly has the most popular shop in town!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the bleak future, after the collapse of our modern technological world, most of the structures we hold dearly today are no longer effective. The things that brought us comfort and ease have fallen into disrepair and disuse. Central governments have given way to localized strongmen. In some places the world is nothing but a vast wasteland and in other locals mankind thrives by calling back to its pre-modern lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Through it all men still choose to compete and challenge each other in the various arenas. Auto racing is one of these sports that will not die. But the rules no longer apply. The racing circuits are no longer about speed and guile. Now they resemble high speed demolition derbies. The most famous organized racing competition of them all, the Apocalypse Road, is run by callous thugs and monsters who encourage drivers to arm their cars and literally destroy their opponents. It is the Roman Coliseum reincarnated.&#10;&#10;Over time, new rules and organizational structures have taken hold. Ten teams now complete across the Thunderverse in a season-long show of firepower and twisted metal. Drivers work as part of a team struggling to complete laps under machine gun and even missile fire. The tracks, falling into decades of disrepair, are a jumbled mess of jumps, joker lanes and dirt. Much like the gladiators of old, in a time of intense anguish, the chance to be a hero, even for a day, calls drivers out to risk life and limb for wealth and food. The arena beckons, will you take the wheel?&#10;&#10;Apocalypse Road is a race game using the Thunder Alley/Grand Prix engine. Players attempt to score points by crossing the finish line (somewhat like roller derby) and by eliminating opposing cars. The first team to 15 points wins the event and gets a double portion of foodstuffs as a reward.&#10;&#10;In Apocalypse Road, a race is played to the accumulation of 15 skins for a team. A Skin may be scored in two ways.&#10;&#10;Each time a car crosses the Finish Line is worth 1 Skin.&#10;    Each opposing car that is eliminated during your activation is worth 1 Skin.&#10;    There is no leading and there is no tracking of lapped cars.&#10;&#10;",

In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!&#10;&#10;What's different with this story compared to other Graphic Novel Adventure books is that The Crusoe Crew is for 1-4 players, and each player has their own book, embodying a particular character with special powers.

Their chosen general, Abraham Steele, would be in charge of recruiting an elite task force whose only goal would be to stop VENOM once and for all.&#10;&#10;Venom Assault is a Cooperative Deck Building game with Dice based combat for 1-5 players.  Players will use their turns to recruit new Freedom Squadron Soldiers and Vehicles into their hands that they will use to challenge one of the seven VENOM leaders on the board.  Each card will have set abilities that can help bring about victory, but VENOM can also call upon their own troops to help them out as well.&#10;&#10;Each game will be played using one of ten missions in the base game, which will tell players what goals they need to accomplish to win the game. However VENOM is not going to be idle and if the players are not careful and quick, they may find they have lost to their devious foes while they weren't looking.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Heredity: Book of Swan is a co-operative, narrative game for 1 to 4 players in which you play a family in a post-apocalyptic world in a campaign structured in five chapters, for a total playing time of 12-15 hours. You can take any number of references as your starting point: Mad Max, Last of Us, The Walking Dead, etc.  All will be revealed as you play!&#10;&#10;The five chapters of the campaign are grouped into five adventure packs including everything you need to play: terrain that forms the game board, characters to interact with, objects, narrative cards, etc. Some cards describe what is seen, found, and met; symbols indicate how each card is used. Depending on your actions and events in the scenario, you can turn over these cards and change the playing field, situation, objects, and characters as you advance through the story in your adventure.&#10;&#10;No matter the player count, four player characters are controlled by the players, while Swan, the youngest member of the family, is a non-playable character. Each character has three action tokens, and you collectively decide in which order to use them to make your characters act out the story you're telling. (Some actions may or must be done by multiple characters at once for maximum effect.) By using the tokens on your character's cards (head, torso, legs), you can talk to other characters, look around, move, fight, or get better items. Each card can also be combined with equipment cards, whose location is indicated using a system of matching symbols. Equipment gives you additional actions or helps you do things. You can switch equipment between games or create new items to use. If your character gets hurt, they can't perform certain actions.&#10;&#10;A &quot;karma&quot; deck is used during checks and combat and can potentially change the outcome of your actions. During the campaign, this deck transforms to match your choices and will influence your morale, actions, story evolution, and ending of the game.&#10;&#10;The game has no fixed order of moves. Instead players follow the &quot;time line&quot; of cards that controls the game's events. The scenarios are written, but your actions lead to cards moving along the timeline as you explore one part of a scenario or another. This makes it possible to create a deeply narrative game without the need for an app.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the turn of the nineteenth century, and mad scientists throughout Europe are competing for the infamy of being the first to create life through the power of alchemy. Using only the raw materials provided by some dubious &quot;Suppliers to the Anatomical Trade&quot;, harnessed lightning, and the services of a motley crew of unattractive servants, in It's Alive! you race to collect the eight body parts needed to create your monster and bring it to life. Unfortunately, the local peasants are particularly clumsy and tend to die in freak farming accidents, so the dubious gentlemen rarely find a whole cadaver in sufficiently good condition. Instead, they offer the parts they have managed to salvage. Each turn, you may buy the offered part, sell it to an anatomist for a meager profit, or auction it, trying to get a better deal or rip off your opponents. You might be lucky and get a coffin with a weakling clerk's cadaver in it, which can be used in lieu of any strapping villager's body part, or your involvement in the macabre trade might invoke the villagers' wrath.&#10;&#10;Reimplements (and reimplemented by)&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Menorah Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each poker hand is competing against the one opposite it that's being built by the opponent.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a pharaoh, they draw three face-down blocks that weren't initially chosen, discard two of them, then add the third block to one of their poker hands.&#10;&#10;Once all the blocks have been removed, the player who wins two or three of the poker hands wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Wars of the Roses were fought between the Houses of York and Lancaster for over three decades during the 15th century in England. The houses were both branches of the royal family, therefore the Wars were originally known as &quot;The Cousins' War&quot;. Each player represents one of the houses as they fight battles and gain influence to control England.&#10;&#10;The Cousins' War is played over a maximum of five rounds, with each round representing between five and ten years of the conflict. Each round involves gaining influence across England and preparing for a climactic battle.&#10;&#10;In each round, the players decide where the current battlefield will be, playing action cards to deploy troops to the battlefield, while also increasing or decreasing their influence in the regions, after which they fight. Players resolve the battle by engaging in bluff and counter-bluff, using three dice, until only one side has troops remaining on the field. Winning the battle helps to consolidate your house's influence on the board.&#10;&#10;You win The Cousins' War either by dominating all the regions of England or by controlling the most regions at the end of the fifth round.&#10;&#10;2nd Edition is a new version of The Cousins' War with larger components. There are English (Surprised Stare Games, Flying Lemur Game Studio), German (Frosted Games) and Spanish (2Tomatoes) versions separately published. 2nd Edition contains an optional variant, Times of Change. This variant adds in the cards originally published as the Events expansion to the 1st edition. There is 1 extra card, Jura Belli, in the Times of Change variant over and above the Events expansion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.&#10;&#10;Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).&#10;&#10;Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.&#10;&#10;Runebound is playable solo and the first edition was updated with a 2nd Edition in 2005 (only 1 year after its release).&#10;&#10;Runebound 1st Edition is different from 2nd Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by two 10-sided dice in the 2nd edition, which helped to better balance the luck factor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1936 Guerra Civil (1936 civil war) is a card game in which each player plays one of the sides in the conflict, either the Republic or the Nationalists. A player must design his deck from the cards available for his side (a pool of over one hundred), with a minimum selection of 36 of them. Besides the cards belonging to one of the two sides, there are cards representing political and military objectives, for which the sides fight. Each objective gives victory points to the player who wins them. Victory can be achieved by military victory points, by political victory points, by a combination of the two of them or by the demoralization of the enemy.&#10;&#10;The game is for two players, although some possible variants for four players are also provided.&#10;&#10;There are different types of cards: objectives (political or military), characters, military units and management cards. Each side is made up of factions (ten factions for the Republic and eight factions for the Nationalists). A side may also benefit from having appointed a leader if certain conditions are met.&#10;&#10;All cards have images from public Spanish archives and contain detailed historical information.&#10;&#10;(A note on the language barrier: it's not as big as it seems. If your first language is French, Italian or Portuguese most game terms will be either the same or very similar. Even with English there are many easily understandable text parts. Additionally, all game text and rules are available to download in French and English from the game's website).&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;     252 unique cards&#10;     4 game boards (one for each side, one for managing military objectives and one for managing political objectives)&#10;     24 small markers to be used on the boards&#10;     1 rulebook 36 pages long, plus two additional double-side reference sheets&#10;&#10;&#10;The game was slowly developed between 2000 and 2006 and it was finally self-published by the author himself through Ediciones Rotura as a limited and numbered edition of 1936 copies, being released in Madrid on December 29, 2006.&#10;&#10;The game entered the BGG ranking on July 18th 2007 (anniversary of the outbreak of the war).&#10;&#10;A small expansion ('Guernica') was released in September 2009 through Spanish magazine ALEA (#33). Several Print&amp;Play expansions have been released since October 2009 linked to the game reaching certain milestones: number of fans in Facebook, number of distributed games, presence during gaming events.&#10;&#10;",

Red hot lava will soon consume the three secret Seien-ji (&#232;&#129;&#150;&#231;&#133;&#153;&#229;&#175;&#186;), sacred temples hidden deep in the bowels of the volcano. The Sh&#197;&#141;gun is determined to preserve the precious heritage and sends his most noble and gifted samurai  warriors on a quest inside the volcano to retrieve the valuable goods.&#10;&#10;After a grueling climb through snowstorms and treacherous rocky terrain the samurai find the entrance that leads down into the cavern.&#10;&#10;The volcano rumbles and the walls start shaking! The floor underneath their feet crumbles and our brave samurai fall into the huge cavern that contains the three temples, which are slowly sinking into the smoldering lava.&#10;&#10;It is now up to our heroes to explore the cavern and find as many of the relics, sacred scrolls, and monks as possible, to bring back safely to the Shogun before the volcano erupts and all is lost forever.&#10;&#10;Fuji Koro can be played in a competitive mode with 2 to 6 players or a cooperative mode with 1 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Players will try and gather sacred scrolls and blueprints for magical weapons, gather resources, craft the best possible gear, and try to get out of the volcano before it fully erupts. To make matter worse, players will encounter fantastical dragons on their journey throughout the volcano, that they will have to try and defeat by themselves or with the help of other players.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the end phase of the game, which is triggered by one player reaching 30 victory points. Once that happens, players will have 8 final turns to escape the volcano.&#10;&#10;To win the game, a player will have to score the most victory points by defeating dragons, exploring the cave, crafting the right weapons and bringing magical gear, dragon teeth and monks to the Sh&#197;&#141;gun during the end phase of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Even if it had been over 200 years, everyone knows a dragon's lifetime can be far longer than that. Yet, here I am like all the other fools. Driven by my thirst for fame and to fill my satchel with coin, I arrived in the village at the same time as the other adventurers...&#10;&#10;Dragons Down is an adventure game inspired by the classic game, Magic Realm. The game is set in Western fantasy where players act as adventurers seeking fame and glory seeking hidden treasure sites, looting great treasures and epic artifacts, fighting monsters... and perhaps each other, all while attempting to become a legend.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players can hide from monsters and other players, move around the realm, search for treasure sites and hidden paths, loot found treasure sites, stay alert for trouble, prepare magic, enchant the realm, and/or rest from their wounds. By slaying monsters, looting epic treasures, completing quests, or even hunting down your fellow adventurers, players accumulate fame and fortune. Although a winner is crowned for collecting the most fame and retiring (or dying), the game is a very large sandbox that can be played with your own goals in mind.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Mars is an unforgiving world, a barren wasteland on the surface, therefore the people live in vast underground cities known as labyrinths. &#10; Over the years, the people of Mars have formed their own culture and identity and want more say in their own rule. To many, Earth is a remote world with too much control over Martian affairs. Furthermore, Earth&rsquo;s corporations have too much power over life and death. Some long for a green Mars, covered in oceans and life. While others recoil at the idea that humanity will destroy the climate of another planet.&#10; Red Dust Rebellion is volume XII of GMT's acclaimed COIN Series, and tells the story of the Martian revolts of the 2250s and the rise of Martian nationalism.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Death Valley: Battles for the Shenandoah is the seventh installment of the Great Battles of the American Civil War (GBACW) series, published by GMT Games.&#10;&#10;Death Valley: Battles for the Shenandoah contains eight battle games with multiple scenarios. They range from division level contests on half sized maps to two map battles between armies. Experienced players will be able to play many of the scenarios in one sitting. The rules compare the development of the cavalry, and the changes in infantry and artillery organization and tactics in 1862 and 1864.&#10;&#10;Three Battles of the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862&#10;In a campaign still studied in military academies, Confederate General Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson engaged and defeated the Union forces pursuing him. Greatly outnumbered and at times facing three Union armies, Jackson defeated them all within ten weeks, at one point completely freeing the Shenandoah Valley of Union forces. Three battles from Jackson&rsquo;s 1862 Valley Campaign are featured.&#10;&#10;    Kernstown, March 23, 1862&#10;    Winchester, May 25, 1862&#10;    Cross Keys and Port Republic, June 8-9, 1862&#10;&#10;&#10;Five Battles of the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864&#10;&#10;    New Market, May 15, 1864&#10;    2nd Kernstown, July 24, 1864&#10;    3rd Winchester, September 19, 1864&#10;    Fisher's Hill, September 22, 1864&#10;    Cedar Creek, October 19, 1864 &#10;&#10;&#10;The Great Battles of the American Civil War Series:&#10;&#10;This series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest-lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental level Gettysburg game &ndash; Terrible Swift Sword (SPI) &ndash; designed by Richard Berg in 1976. Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable, but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles. The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the oftentimes-chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level.&#10;&#10;Changes have been made to the series rules for Death Valley in order to enhance their clarity and simulation value. Veteran players will find the revised rules to be very familiar, with the main differences being in the user-friendliness of the rulebook, as well as how the game &quot;feels&quot;, especially for players versed in Civil War tactics.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        1960 counters&#10;        Three 22&quot; x 34&quot; double-sided maps&#10;        Two 17&quot; x 22&quot; double-sided maps&#10;        One GBACW series rules booklet&#10;        Two Battle booklets&#10;        Sixteen Activation and Turn Record charts&#10;        Two Player Aid Cards&#10;        One Terrain Effects Chart&#10;        One 2nd Disorder Chart&#10;        Two 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: Each Turn = 1 Hour&#10;MAP SCALE: 145 Yards Per Hex with 25-Foot Elevations&#10;UNIT SCALE: 50 Men or 1 Cannon per Strength Point&#10;&#10;description from GMT website&#10;&#10;",

Without the right naval vessels, these voyages would have been impossible. But even the incredible wealth of the royal houses could not sustain these expeditions for long. So they were happy that private entrepreneurs were ready to finance these expensive journeys. Now your king has come to offer you the opportunity to invest in the great voyages of famous explorers like Columbus and Magellan. You will need to purchase a fleet of ships, and assign them to the most successful expeditions. Of course, you will need a lot of money! To earn money, you must fulfill trade contracts. Can you balance the needs of trade with the demands of the great explorers? It is time to seek wealth and glory in the Age of Discovery!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The game board depicts nine cities in a diamond shape, with St. Louis at one tip and Sacramento at the other, and locations where track can be built are marked on the game board.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places one of their track tiles in the appropriate space, paying the cost while doing so.

    "Description": "An interesting little game that uses a miniscule deck of 28 cards, consisting of 2 identical suits of Sun and Moon cards. Each partnership takes the part of either the Sun or Moon cult, and plays cards only of its designated suit. An interesting mechanic is that since the cards are dealt randomly, it is often necessary and even prudent to have an opponent play a card for you. The object of the game is to collect souls (of either cult) and temples of your own suit (which serve as a multiplier). Rounds move quickly, and points can add up dramatically.

    "Description": "At Any Cost: Metz 1870 is a game simulating the situation west of the Metz fortress during those few days of August 1870. The game is designed to be a playable, two-player brigade-scale game that allows players to experience the unique tactical warfare matchups that characterized fighting during the Franco-Prussian War.&#10;&#10;This era, though generally overlooked in the gaming industry, is a fascinating study in Napoleonic tactics (and uniforms) slamming head-on into modern killing technology. The Prussian military juggernaut is armed with the new steel Krupp breach-loading artillery pieces that far outclassed the French guns. Prussian doctrine, adapted to the lessons learned during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, allowed junior officers to exercise initiative and aggressiveness. The French army, meanwhile, was armed with the modern and deadly Chassepot rifle, a firearm so advanced that many argue its deployment alone should have won the war for the French. In addition, the French army was now equipped with their ultimate secret weapon - the Mitrailleuse, which was the first machinegun used en masse. Moreover, the game system makes clear that the French soldier, despite misconceptions to the contrary, fought valiantly during these battles. By all rights, they could have &ndash; and should have &ndash; won many of these engagements. But leadership, morale and tenacity won the day for the Prussians.&#10;&#10;All these factors are seamlessly embedded into the At Any Cost game system and players will be challenged to utilize their advantages and minimize their disadvantages throughout the game. Will YOU as the Prussian player be able to withstand an early severe numerical disadvantage and use the brave audacity of the Prussian soldier and artilleryman to win the day? Can YOU as the French player overcome the lethargic and uninspired command structure of the Army of the Rhine and allow your tough and well-equipped infantry to fight unhindered?&#10;&#10;At Any Cost: Metz 1870 also features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the current situation. Unlike traditional chit-pull mechanisms, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.&#10;&#10;UNITS&#10;&#10;All brigades and artillery groups of both the French Army of the Rhine and the Prussian First and Second Armies that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each Strength Point equals 600 infantrymen, 450 cavalry troopers, 3 heavy artillery pieces or 4 light artillery pieces. In addition, units have a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience plus a Movement Allowance.&#10;&#10;SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS&#10;&#10;Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a two-D10 dice mechanic. Two differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The first (colored) die generates an initial result and the second (white) die simultaneously informs the players of any physical casualties suffered by the unit and any morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire. The assault combat system uses a differential mechanism and results in a more dynamic combat outcome.&#10;&#10;Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, March or Regroup. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.&#10;&#10;Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for both players. It features three different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:&#10;&#10;Activation Chits = these activate all units of the listed Corps or Cavalry Division. In some scenarios, Activation chits for the French player are fed into the game piece-meal to represent the slow reaction time of the French command structure. But the French player does have some options to speed up this process (see below). &#10;CIC Chits = these are special Activation Chits. The Prussian player has a Chief-of-Staff chit and the French player has a Commander-in-Chief chit. These chits allow players to select any one Division (for the Prussian player) or any one Brigade (for the French player) for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate units twice in the turn. &#10;Event Chits = there are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of a turn, players select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are then placed into the cup with the pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they initially chose.&#10;&#10;Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all of which are different) and a Command (or Common) Event side. The Unique Event is tactical in nature and has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Event examples are Auftragstaktik, Krupp&rsquo;s Guns, Beaten Zone, Moulin a&rsquo; Cafe and Battlefield Conditions. The Command (Common) Event side is used for more strategic options. The Prussian player may attempt to speed up his reinforcements and/or change their arrival location and to curtail the effects of the Prussian Aggressive Tactics Event that the French player may play against him. The French player can use his Command Events to hasten his Activation chit availability and to attempt to cancel the effects of the crippling Bazaine&rsquo;s Malaise Event.&#10;&#10;Prussian Strategic Movement: In order to add player input into the strategic off-map movement of the approaching Prussian forces, some scenarios offer the opportunity to use the unique hidden Prussian Strategic Movement system. This involves the Prussian player openly moving units on a special point-to-point map whose results, nevertheless, are hidden from the French player. This will vary where and when the Prussian forces arrive on the map. However, the system is set up so that even the Prussian player cannot be assured of the arrival time or the content of his forces. There will be a solitaire friendly version of this feature, as well.&#10;&#10;MAP&#10;&#10;The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire west of Metz. Each hex equal approximately 500 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, towns, quarries etc.&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;The game includes six scenarios:&#10;&#10;The Afternoon Crisis - a small, limited battle depicting the French advance across the Fond de la Cove on August 16th, 1870. This scenario serves as a teaching experience for new players. &#10;Twilight Of The Guards &ndash; a small, limited battle depicting the fighting around St. Privat on August 16th, which at one point resulted in 6,000 Prussian Guardsmen casualties being inflicted in 15 minutes! This scenario serves as a teaching experience for new players. &#10;The Battle of Mars-La-Tour &ndash; the whole battle beginning at 8:00 am and continuing the entire day. There are two variations offered &ndash; historical and free-setup deployments. There are also options for a historical reinforcements schedule or a variable schedule utilizing the Prussian Strategic Movement system. &#10;The Battle of Gravelotte-St. Privat &ndash; &ndash; the entire day-long battle. There are two variations offered &ndash; historical and free-setup deployments. There are also options for a historical reinforcements schedule or a variable schedule utilizing the Prussian Strategic Movement system. &#10;Campaign Scenario #1 &ndash; the game begins with the Mars-La-Tour scenario but continues past the first day until the campaign victory conditions are achieved.  &#10;Campaign Scenario #2 &ndash; the game begins on August 15th and the French player must march the entire Army of the Rhine across the map to escape to Verdun or, as a secondary option, protect the army from destruction. The Prussian army&rsquo;s movement is done entirely via the Prussian Strategic Movement system until they enter the game map. This scenario gives players the option to shape an entirely new campaign.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;1 &ndash; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map&#10;2 &ndash; 9/16&rdquo; countersheets&#10;1 &ndash; Rulebook&#10;1 &ndash; Playbook (Scenarios, Historical Notes and Examples of Play)&#10;1 &ndash; Game Tracks Card&#10;1 &ndash; Prussian Strategic Movement Card&#10;4 &ndash; Player Aids (2 Prussian and 2 French) &#10;4 &ndash; Ten-Sided Dice (1 Blue, 1 Red and 2 White)&#10;&#10;",

What&rsquo;s worse, the ultimate gem to rule them all has been forged into a single, mighty scepter. Whoever holds it wields even more power at an even greater price.&#10;&#10;In Puzzle Strike 2, players build their deck as they play, giving them the tools to arrange and manipulate their set of colored gems. These gems can be &ldquo;crashed&rdquo; (destroyed) in order to build up power for four different super moves as well as to flood other players with more gems. As this process unfolds, gems will fly back and forth between players as they desperately try to remain under the threshold of corruption. Holding the scepter &ldquo;helps,&rdquo; but can also doom the greedy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.&#10;&#10;For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Space Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The world is too late. The virus known as MV1 has gone global. You, the leader of your people, have moved quickly to consolidate your local governments in hopes that you are not too late to carve some chance of hope out of what appears to be none. Rushing to develop effective technologies and retrain your military against this new threat proves difficult but is your only chance at salvation. Resources will prove important and become continually scarce as MV1 continues to sweep through your territory. Do you have what it takes to keep your people alive? Or, better yet, can you eliminate the threat of the walking dead from your territory completely? Many technologies lay at your disposal if you test them successfully, but the true strength of these technologies lie in the versatile combinations that you choose to use. Will you rely on military strength, physics and science, or research medicine to find a cure? Perhaps your survival lies in utilizing combinations of these technologies. Either way your fallen countrymen have only one form of diplomacy and that is that they are at peace only when they are feeding. Feeding on you and your people and spreading the deadly MV1 viral infection. Welcome to The Zombie State: Diplomacy of the Dead.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;You are the world leader of a group of nations.  Each turn zombies feed and randomly spread throughout your territory, quickly reducing your population and increasing the number of zombies. At the beginning of the game you have no technologies or military that are effective against the viral threat on a worldwide scale.  Each turn you must maximize the use of resources to draft and use military, test technologies, and then strategically use these successfully tested technologies.  As the game progresses, outbreaks and the spread of zombies makes the game more difficult through a loss of population, resources, and freedom to act.  However, if you have been an effective leader you will have developed effective technologies that you may use to try and eliminate the threat from your territory completely. Otherwise leaders will find the game ends with the total conversion of their population into the walking dead.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 2123 and the planet earth is becoming uninhabitable. New powers of interstellar travel make it possible for earthlings to find a new home. Competing teams of human explorers use space stations spread throughout the universe as bases for discovering new worlds and befriending aliens to help them in their quest. Explorer teams are not only racing each other, but an alien race also hoping to discover the planets. Will your team be able to reach a planets before the others to establish colonies?&#10;&#10;Cosmic Run: Regeneration is a revised version of Cosmic Run. Like the original, Cosmic Run: Regeneration is a quick, push-your-luck, space race for 1-4 players. On a turn, a player rolls dice and must commit at least 1 of them to one of the various exploration tracks or to an alien card. Some of the tracks require multiple identical dice, with the most valuable tracks costing many identical dice. However, once a player commits a die, it cannot be moved. So players have to decide between a conservative approach (making sure and steady progress along less valuable tracks) or an aggressive approach (pushing one's luck to try to move up the highly valued tracks).&#10;&#10;Players may opt to use their dice to befriend aliens, rather than explore, because the aliens provide special powers that can eventually help them move along their exploration tracks even faster.  The game may be played competitively or cooperatively.&#10;&#10;Cosmic Run: Regeneration is different from the original Cosmic Run in many ways. Regarding the rules, these are the main changes:&#10;- A 6th planet track with its own rules for placement&#10;- A 6th type of alien card&#10;- The mechanism for the alien race landing on planets (which used to be meteors hitting planets) is now card-based, rather than dice&#10;- Alien cards must be turned in during the game to score points&#10;- Alien cards are one use and easier to acquire&#10;&#10;The game's components are also different, insofar as this game has a full board and some updated graphic design.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your civilization has reached the stars, and your population is hungry for discovery. Explore, colonize, research &mdash; but be sure to build up your strength to be ready for the dangers that await!&#10;&#10;One Deck Galaxy is a co-op space civilization-building game using only cards, dice, and tokens. Each card in the deck represents both a location in space your civilization has scouted, but also the benefits it could reap by colonizing or studying it. These benefits increase your ability to roll dice and manipulate them, and help your civilization grow stronger. When the deck runs out, the era advances and your foes become more dangerous. If you're not ready, they may overwhelm you and send your empire into decline before it can become truly great!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Western Town, each player is a Marshal of an expanding town in the Old West of the U.S. in the early 1860s. Each Marshal wants to develop the most prosperous town, one that President Lincoln himself would be proud to visit.&#10;&#10;The three principal criteria that allow you to win the game are population growth, charm/attractiveness, and wealth, as measured by gold. Turns are regulated by the visits of Lincoln, who determines, bit-by-bit, the value of the towns relative to those three criteria. These criteria can and do change every round, and you will need to adapt to these changing criteria to win this game!&#10;&#10;Each player has his own board on which he will be building his town. Every building gives him different, and increasing, rights and abilities, and therefore power. The bigger your town gets, the better &ndash; but managing too much growth is challenging, so you'll need to make difficult choices at the beginning of each round as to which buildings you'll bring into play.&#10;&#10;This &quot;building-adding&quot; mechanism helps players stay in the game and not get lost in the overwhelming number of choices available. Of 22 different buildings, six of them are identified every round as &quot;bonus&quot; buildings, and players are forced to adapt varying strategies and test new combinations of these buildings for their town as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;In addition to logic and strategy, Marshals will need to bluff and occasionally resort to questionably bending the law a bit, to succeed in building their Western Town. And as if that weren't enough, there are even occasional Indian attacks to deal with as well!&#10;&#10;",

Carthage concentrates on Punic events that take place in Carthage/Africa as well as Sicily, with the main scenario being the massive First Punic War. Building on the popular mechanics and systems of Rise of the Roman Republic (Vol I), Carthage includes the full, advances naval system, with galley battles, fleet building expanding ports, and everything featured in the unusual, truly naval war that was the First Punic War. In addition, the detailed political systems for both powers, the soul of the game and a set of mechanics that truly puts the players in the heart of ongoing events, are expanded and clarified. With the addition of rules for the Reduction and Repair of city defenses, militia, and the ability of garrisons to Sally, sieges are now more than just sideshows.&#10;&#10;Carthage still uses The Ancient World's unique combat system, with its unusual Unpredictable Results, elephants, cavalry pursuit, and the dangers of fighting too many battles. Carthage's main scenario is, of course, the First Punic War, a twenty year affair that will take some time to play, but keep you entranced for years. The game also includes quick, one evening scenarios, including the playtester two-turn favorite Hiero; Hero or Gyro?, the twisty opening year of the First Punic War. We also have short scenarios for the first invasion of Carthage by Agathocles of Syracuse (311 BC) and the infamous Mercenary War that erupted in Carthage right after the First Punic War (241 BC).&#10;&#10;Carthage contains one full-sized map - the slightly redone Italy map (we've expanded rivers to a three-tiered system and corrected some tangential map errata) - plus a half-map for Carthage and Africa. The 1000+ full-color counters include every Roman magistrate of the era plus lots of Libyans, Numidians, Egyptians, Iberians, Celts ... if they were there, they're in this game. Also, part of the game package is a expanded group of play-aid charts, prompted by playtester insistence, to help keep track of the many details that campaigning can require.&#10;Carthage is the Punic War's game that ancients and gaming aficionados have been waiting for since the beginning of the wargame hobby. Detailed and demanding, it provides players with a highly playable leel of insight, decision-making, and just pure Fun.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;TIME SCALE     1 year per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     13 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE      Strength point = either 500 men; 300 cavalry; 10 elephants&#10;&#10;Designer: Richard Berg&#10;Developer: Alan Ray&#10;Art Director: Rodger B.

    "Description": "The third game based on the German web cartoon &quot;Nichtlustig&quot; by Joscha Sauer. It features the Mafia Lemming characters from the cartoon.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&quot;Real lemmings want to jump off the next cliff. Members of the different lemming mafia families aren't any different. Because in the game, there is not only one, but six members of the suicidal species, they make a contest out of it. They all run to the lake and the first one who jumps in the lake wins. And it wouldn't be a real race if you couldn't place bets on the result. Each player has his favorite lemmings and tries to use the dice results to influence the race.&quot;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has 6 cards (1/lemming), and 2 mission cards (bonus VP at end of game). On your turn, roll two dice (sides show one of the lemming colors) then choose to move one of those lemmings (if one is out of the race, move the lemming in last place). Lemmings may move one track section at a time, to any unoccupied space in the next section. The spaces on the race track are one of several types (e.g., give a lemming concrete shoe; 2=dead, remove concrete, allow you to place bets, move a lemming, etc.).&#10;&#10;Betting is interesting: each time, you have the option to bet. To do so, place a lemming card face down on top of your stack of bet cards; goal is to place winner on TOP of your stack (last bet placed).&#10;&#10;The game ends when a lemming reaches the finish; place remaining lemmings in the order they are on the track. Mission cards score bonus VP if completed, or cost VP if failed. Then resolve bets: turn over your cards, then go through them getting 1 VP per card revealed until you get to winning lemming (max 6 VP).&#10;&#10;",

With these resources, you develop your colonies and attempt to build science stations and outposts.&#10;&#10;The game is played over ten rounds, each of which consists of three phases: discover, excavate, develop.&#10;&#10;In the discover phase, a resource card is flipped and resources are placed in excavation zones.&#10;&#10;In the excavation phase, players use their excavation cards to compete for those resources.&#10;&#10;In the development phase, development tiles (which are won in the excavation phase and come in a variety of shapes) are placed on the player's individual colony board. The resources, which also include ships, colonists, and crystals are placed in designated spots on the tiles.&#10;&#10;In the competitive game, players score points by creating the best mining colony, i.e., having various resources, people, and ships that are determined to be more valuable.&#10;&#10;In the solo mode, the player competes against a dummy player while they attempt to complete their colony.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is 1700, and a youthful Karl XII has recently come to power as King of Sweden. Rivals around the Baltic Sea seize the opportunity to get their hands on Swedish territory. An alliance is struck between Denmark, Saxony-Poland, and Russia, the last under the vibrant leadership of Tsar Pyotr. This coalition mobilizes to take advantage of the untried King, and break Swedish dominance in the Baltics forever... Thus opened the Great Northern War, ravaging Northern and Eastern Europe for over two decades at the beginning of the eighteenth century. By the end of the war, one nation would lose its status as a Great Power, while another would rise to dominate the region for centuries onward.&#10;&#10;PAX BALTICA is a two-player wargame covering the entire Great Northern War (1700-1721). Published first as a limited &ldquo;guerilla&rdquo; edition in 2009 by Three Crowns Game Productions of Sweden, this new enhanced edition has been revised and upgraded by GMT Games in conjunction with the original designers.&#10;&#10;Over twenty years of fighting span the map from Norway to Turkey, Saxony to Finland. Units are represented by labeled wooden blocks, which are stood upright to conceal their identity and strength from the enemy, allowing players to dupe and outfox each other on campaign. Action points are spent to maneuver on the map, but also for reconnaissance, replacements, or a roll on the treacherous but lucrative National Politics Table. Straightforward rules account for lines of communication and forage, as well as time-consuming sieges, adding to the period flavor. The fast-paced and exciting combat system captures the aggressive &quot;charge with cold steel&quot; tactics that Sweden used to defeat her enemies in succession at the start of the war.&#10;&#10;Players are subject to a host of influences and distractions that will hinder their plans at every turn. An elaborate plan will be at the mercy of a poor action roll or sudden plague, while other events shape strategy with historical motivations and deterrents. Players must prepare for the worst, but be open to fleeting opportunities.&#10;&#10;Special rules capture simply the unique events and circumstances of the Great Northern War, including:&#10;&bull; Russian army reforms&#10;&bull; Ukrainian Cossack uprisings&#10;&bull; Intervention by the Ottoman Empire&#10;&bull; Polish royal politics&#10;&bull; Attrition of Swedish manpower&#10;&bull; Founding of Sankt-Peterburg&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are included with the game: a short tournament scenario covering the Swedish invasion of Russia that led to the Battle of Polt&aacute;va; two scenarios that simulate the first and last half of the war; and a &ldquo;grand campaign&rdquo; scenario that refights the entirety of the Great Northern War, a first in wargame publishing. Turns typically take no more than a couple of minutes, ensuring a fast pace of play. Swings of fortune ensure that no two games will turn out the same.&#10;&#10;Can you save Sweden&rsquo;s empire? Or ensure Russia&rsquo;s rise to prominence? You make the choices that will determine who reigns over the PAX BALTICA.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&bull; 1 Map (22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;)&#10;&bull; 1 Rulebook (16 pages)&#10;&bull; 1 Playbook (32 pages)&#10;&bull; 65 wooden blocks (units) in five colors&#10;&bull; 1 sticker sheet for mounting on blocks&#10;&bull; 51 wooden cubes (control markers, etc.) in six colors&#10;&bull; 8 dice, 4 blue and 4 green&#10;&#10;Game Design: Stefan Ekstr&ouml;m and G&ouml;ran Bj&ouml;rkman&#10;Development for GMT: Scott Muldoon&#10;Complexity: 4&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 3&#10;Scale: Strategic. 1 turn = one season; units are armies, regiments, and fleets; 1 strength step = approx. 1500 troops or 6-8 fighting ships&#10;Players: 2&#10;Time to Play: 1-2 hours for the shortest scenario, 7-14 hours for the grand campaign&#10;&#10;&#10;Original Three Crowns edition:&#10;&#10;Great Northern war, a 21-year long war lasted from 1700 to 1721 and ended Sweden&rsquo;s period as a major power in northern Europe and started Russia&rsquo;s domination of Eastern Europe. An intriguing conflict that is often considered a side-show of the War of Spanish succession. Nevertheless the former had probably greater impact of the developments in Europe during the 100 years to come than the latter. The effects of the war are in fact still seen today.&#10;&#10;Pax Baltica. Probably the first board game ever covering the entire Great Northern War.  The game includes five different scenarios with a varying playtime between two hours and a day. The units in the game are blocks which give a great flexibility in taking steps and differentiate the quality and strength of the troops. The high quality map is divided into provinces which you have to conquer in order to take control over a country. This dynamic conflict covers large parts of northern and eastern Europe. From Bremen in the West to Smolensk in the East. From Trondheim in the North to Bender in the South.&#10;Playable nations are Sweden, Russia, Turkey, Denmark and Saxony. Other countries represented as minors are: Great Britain, Poland, Ukraine, Prussia and Hanover. The game, packed in a book case, includes a A2 full color map, 60 high quality wooden blocks, 4 dice, various markers and rules including 5 scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Following on the success of No Retreat: The Russian Front, where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, Victory Point Games' dynamic duo of game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up again to present the second chapter in this game series, No Retreat: The North African Front. This time they take the gaming action to the African Front, from the start of Operation Compass on 8 December 1940, through 1942 to the eviction of the Axis from Libya.&#10;&#10;Building on the notion of a card assisted game and death-or-glory victory conditions, No Retreat: The North African Front offers a narrative game rich in the feel for the ebb-and-flow of the campaign, wrapped around an exciting maneuver and combat system that harkens back to the glory days of classic wargaming, but includes all the modern features and plenty of innovations. Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 &quot;mini-maps&quot; located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating &quot;mini-games&quot; in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.&#10;&#10;This Deluxe Edition combines both the original game, featuring Five quick-playing scenarios, a Tournament Game, a Full-Fledged Campaign game, and a Bonus &quot;Invasion of Crete&quot; mini-game, all using deluxe components of &quot;Twillight Struggle Deluxe Edition&quot; quality.&#10;&#10;The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.&#10;&#10;The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.&#10;&#10;The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake. You must endure and prevail under the most surprising and grueling of circumstances, for there is No Retreat!&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;&#10;No Retreat: The Invasion of Crete&#10;This Bonus mini-game will allow you to refight the first airborne invasion in history, during May 1941. Each player will fight to gain or maintain control of the Island's critical 3 airfields. Time is of the essence here as each contestant has to manage his limited ressources in a life-or-death contest where neither has space to Retreat! This is a very intense knife-fight that can be very well be decided in the few first days, while the German Airborne force is most vulnerable, or could turn into a desperate rear-guard action, as the hard-pressed Allied troops try to escape the island. An innovative pre-game set-up planning procedure, and Airborne Landing rules, will insure that no two games play the same.&#10;&#10;Scenario Listing:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Compass, 1940: The British surprise offensive against the unprepared Italians in Lybia, pushing them back over 300 miles and capturing 115,000 prisoners!  This scenario makes an excellent tutorial due to its low unit density. It is essentially a race game, with the Allies rushing to reach Map 2 and win the game there.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Sunflower, 1941: Rommel arrives in Africa with the 21st Panzer Division and begins operations to roll back the recent Allied advances, thanks to the withdrawal of their best troops to fight in Greece. Can you capture the important Port/Fortress of Tobruk, or will you to be stopped by the tenacious Australians?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Crusader, 1941: The importance of Tobruk and pressure from Malta on the Axis convoy routes to Africa caused both sides to fully commit to winning the war in the western desert during the British all-out attack to relieve the siege of the embattled Fortress. It's a wild free-for all battle, where speed of manoeuvre is all-important.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Venezia, 1942: After capturing Tobruk in this operation and routing the Allied forces in the desert (and the cancellation of the Malta Invasion), the German High Command sends resources to help Rommel&rsquo;s exhausted forces race to Egypt. Can the forces of the Commonwealth hold the line at El-Alamein, or will the Afrika Corps reach Alexandria and the Suez Canal?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Lightfoot 1942: The last-ditch defence of Egypt and the resulting stalemate at El Alamein was finally turned to victory for the Allies as Monty&rsquo;s overwhelming force pushed back the depleted and badly-supplied Axis Divisions. Or maybe Rommel will be able again to outmanoeuvre the British foe, and turn this battle of attrition into another of his famous victories? &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A Tournament Scenario 1941: For players that have time to play more than a scenario, but not enough for the full-fledged campaign game.  Action starts with the first Rommel Attack of Operation Sunflower, and continues until Operation Crusader the end of 1941. Can the British keep Tobruk and Beghazi, or will the scenario end in an historical stalemate around Gazala? &#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     One 22x18 Mapboard &amp; two 11x18 Mapboards (all mounted and two-sided)&#10;     One sheet of 88, 2-sided square units - One sheet of 56, 2-sided round markers.&#10;     One rule book (24 pages)&#10;     One Scenario Book (24 pages)&#10;     55 Event Cards (36 for NR2!, 19 for Crete)&#10;     Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Number of Players: 2&#10;Ages: 14 and up&#10;Playing Time: approximately 50 minutes for each scenario; 4 to 5 hours for a campaign game; 60 to 90 minutes tor the Crete mini-game.&#10;Scale NR2: German &amp; Allied units are Divisions (8-10,000 men), Italian units are Corps of binary (2 Regiment) Divisions; each hex is 15km across, and each turn is 1-2 months of real time (sometimes split into tactical turns of 3-4 days) .&#10;Scale Crete: Units are Multi-Battalion size battlegroups; each hex is 3km across, and each turn is 8-12 hours.&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Charles Kibler&#10;MAP ART: Charles Kibler&#10;&#10;",
