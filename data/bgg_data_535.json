    "Description": "The players place their tokens on the start space.Each turn the players throw a die. If a 1 is thrown the player can move the pawn to the next field. When a player throws 2 - 5 the player takes a card from the pile. The player reads the question on the card aloud. The hourglass is turned and every player, including the player who had read the card, has 2 minutes to give the right answer. If a player knows the answer, he/she shouts 'stop.' When it is the correct answer that player may move its pawn to the next grey circle corresponding to the number on the card. Otherwise the player has to move backwards to the circle with the same number. If a 6 is thrown the player may choose a card from the pile.&#10;When there is no time left and nobody has given the correct answer, then the next player starts its turn. The first player who reaches the last space, wins the game.&#10;&#10;A variant of the game is to write down the answer and compare them when the time is up. All the players move their tokens forward or backwards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Unbridled Fury is a set of miniatures rules for the fantasy genre which is designed from the ground up for skirmish battles. These small engagements and affrays are set in worlds as diverse as the players themselves (as well as the history of our very own Earth). It has no &lsquo;official&rsquo; setting or miniatures line and allows the players to use whatever they want, in whatever setting they desire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Game-play is fast and brutal. The game is a departure from the regular approach to fantasy skirmish games - combat feels more like an all-out brawl rather than organized groups of fighters rolling dice at each other. You can almost feel the pain of the fighters as they hurl themselves into battle. Once the players get a grip on the rules games are usually over in under an hour, which is crucial to those who have to squeeze real life in between them. Physical space required is also&#10;small - most 4&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; terrain boards are ideal; kitchen tables will suffice, though, and may even produce a tighter battle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules were designed to be used with 28mm figures. &quot;[O]ne figure represents one warrior, beast or frothing lunatic, so the effect of a single figure on the game is of great importance.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Every figure has a profile, a set of equipment (weapons, armour, etc.) and possibly some 'special abilities.'&quot; The profile for a figure consists of nine categories plus any special abilities. Special abilities include Berserker, Camouflage, Creature of Darkness, Fanatic, Flier, Giantslayer, Invisible, Musician, Night Vision, Teleporter, Undead, and Were-Creature.&#10;&#10;The game includes rules on creating characters, companies, and setting up games using scenario creation tables. The game play covers areas such as command, morale, visibility, ambushes, cowardice, and fires.&#10;&#10;",

By doing so they made golf portable (think family vacations, road trips and even around the office), accessible and incredibly easy to learn, even for someone who has never stepped foot on a real fairway.&#10;&#10;Par Out Golf is challenging, exciting and incredibly unique, playing as inconsistently as the real sport thanks to a twist you'll never &quot;see&quot; coming! It puts you and your family in the middle of the action, competing in stroke play, match play, or one of the many variations that will continue to challenge and entertain round after round.&#10;&#10;Best for ages 5 and up and from 1 to 4 players, Par Out Golf is filled with lighthearted competition as players shoot for the lowest score through the 18 stunningly illustrated holes on the course. Game play is easy to learn for the amateur or junior golfer, and still challenging for the pro requiring a strikingly similar level of skill and focus on every shot.&#10;&#10;Best of all, this course can be played again and again! A simple wipe with a damp cloth is all it takes to get the greens and fairways ready for another round.&#10;&#10;Par Out Golf is played on a set of spiral bound, laminated pages. Special &quot;wet-erase&quot; markers are used so the line is easy to draw, won't smudge, and very easy to erase. The rules are very, very close to the game of golf, complete with sand and water traps, obstacles and slopes. So close is it to &quot;real&quot; golf, you can play each of five classic variations of golf: stroke play, match play, tombstone play, and pro play.&#10;&#10;Of the several skills you practice while playing Par Out Golf, a fascinating, and, to any golf player, significant challenge is learning how to visualize your shot. The more observant you are, the more capable you are at remembering the lay of the land, the more effectively you can imagine the exact amount of drive to put on the ball, the better you'll do. This, of course, is the essence of Par Out Golf. Like &quot;real&quot; golf, Par Out Golf challenges both mind and body. If you want to know more about the physical and cognitive aspects of the game, take a look at the thoughtfully written essay: Par Out Science 101 at www.paroutgolf.com.&#10;&#10;If you want, you can practice on the Driving Range (on another page) or use the 19th hole (on yet another page) to design your own. You can add your own obstacles, changing the difficulty of each hole, essentially making the game something you can play for-just-about-ever.&#10;&#10;Par Out Golf is recommended for 1 to 4 players (it comes with four different wet-erase markers). If you must try before you buy, you can download the first three holes online.&#10;&#10;",

Players move their forces and have combat across the map in an effort to occupy key areas at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game, published in Issue #3 (Spring 2008) of Panzer Digest, comes with a mapsheet, set of unit counters and markers, and rules (printed within the magazine).  The map represents a portion of northern Italy where the original campaign was conducted.  Movement on the map is regulated via a series of areas, usually representing towns.  Areas that are connected by a line are adjacent to one another.  There are no terrain effects in the game, and any one area is the same as any other, though some areas are designated with a star to represent victory areas.&#10;&#10;French and Austrian units represent divisions, and each combat strength point represents approximately 1000 men.  Units take losses in combat by marking off lost strength points from a unit roster.  The overall commanders, Napoleon for the French and Alvinczy for the Austrians, are also represented by counters.  Napoleon has a number of special benefits, to help balance the massive numerical advantage of the Austrian army.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, players bid the number of victory points they claim they can earn playing the Austrians, and the player with the highest bid must earn at least that many to win.  Each turn represents three days of campaigning, and the game lasts six turns.  Playing time is about 20 minutes solitaire, about 45-90 minutes against an opponant.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to score the most points possible during each turn. Players score points when a die or dice combination matches one or more numbers on the field of play. Players use glass markers to cover those numbers as they compete.&#10;&#10;Game in a Nutshell&#10;&#10;The first player rolls three dice onto the field of play, called the leather , then uses glass markers ( paddy flats , or flatties ) to cover numbers that match an individual die or dice combination (see Basic Roll). A turn ends when a player is topped &mdash;unable to use all three dice to cover one, two, or three numbers on the leather . On the final roll of a turn, a player is allowed to cover as many numbers as possible, even if all of the dice cannot be played. At the end of each turn, points are added up and recorded by the scorekeeper. The dice are then passed to the next player.&#10;&#10;Players must always roll three dice. If a roll results in stacked or cocked dice, including those cocked against a flattie , all three must be rolled again.&#10;&#10;The player with the most accumulated points wins the match.&#10;&#10;Basic Roll &#10;Dice can be added together or played as naturals. For example, a 2 , 4 , 5 roll offers five options:&#10;&#10;Cover the 2 , 4 , and 5 .&#10;&#10;Cover the 6 [2 + 4] and the 5 .&#10;&#10;Cover the 9 [4 + 5] and the 2 .&#10;&#10;Cover the 7 [2 + 5] and the 4 .&#10;&#10;Cover the 11 [2 + 4 + 5].&#10;&#10;This is just an overview&hellip;.&#10;&#10;You will also learn how to score the game.

Its purpose is to encourage intergenerational discussions of wealth management within families. The game name comes from the saying, &quot;From shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations,&quot; meaning that a family fortune earned in one generation can easily be lost by another.&#10;&#10;This game was featured on the news radio program &quot;Marketplace&quot; and a version of the story can be found online here: http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/06/25/shirtsleeves_to_shirtsleeves/&#10;&#10;A summary of gameplay, excerpted from the &quot;Marketplace&quot; report:&#10;&#10;&quot;Every player starts with $25 million in play money and from there the game is kind of a cross between Monopoly and the game Life. You roll the die and move your piece along a snaky row of squares in the shape of a dollar sign...every turn, you have to draw a card...Everyone starts in generation one and after a few turns...You enter generation two and then three and there's a separate deck of cards for each.&quot;&#10;&#10;According to the report, GenSpring is coming out with an advanced version of Shirtsleeves to Shirtsleeves that will let players control the outcome of the game.&#10;&#10;",

These pieces are placed upright on the wooden playing board (15 x 7 inches), at the center of which there is a pendulum made of a one inch diameter wooden ball affixed to a 10 inch long string.  Players take turns pulling back the ball and letting go it, allowing it to free-swing in any direction around the board.   A player wins the round by knocking over the opponent's 7 pieces before all of one's own pieces are knocked over by the pendulum.&#10;&#10;Variants described in the instruction booklet include St. Louie (&quot;The Pendulum Dice Game&quot;), Tower Tumble (noncompetitive), and Bowling.&#10;&#10;Pendulum has a small 16 page instruction booklet which includes 14 black and white photos, most of young children playing the game.  There is one picture (from about 1900) of an outdoor game of 'quilles', described as &quot;an early pendulum game developed in France in the 14th century.&quot;&#10;&#10;According to the booklet, Pendulum's &quot;composition is of a Folk Toy Style.&quot;   Its board design is &quot;taken from a 12th century A.D. Jain Temple at Kathiawar built to honor Patala, a land devoted to games.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game book is attributed to Anne Rivers and Carl Chase.  The game and package design are attributed to Carl Chase.  Pendulum was distributed in the mid-1980's by Pinocchio's, located in Kalamazoo, Michigan.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;A Thrill on Every Play. New Thrills in Every Game. Easy to Play. Realistic Football for Real Fans.&quot;&#10;&#10;This vintage football card game was originally released in the mid-twenties. A 1940 edition, marked on the box cover as the &quot;New Collegiate Edition&quot;, was used to prepare the following description. The limited information located regarding the twenties edition indicates that it may have been self-published, but otherwise it is believed to be similar to the later edition.&#10;&#10;The 1940 New Collegiate Edition consists of a box, a 16 3/4 x 9 3/4 inch football-field board (a box bottom insert), 55 Offensive cards, 55 Defensive cards, individual card boxes for these two sets of cards, 29 Time-Out cards, a metal football marker, a cardboard &quot;10-Yard Marker&quot; and the rules.  Note that there are are tracks on the board for keeping track of the four quarters and four downs, so there may have been additional markers to place on these tracks.&#10;&#10;The board depicts a 100-yard football field, marked in one yard increments. The 10-Yard marker is used to determine when enough yardage has been gained for a first down. The metal ball is used to mark the field position of the ball. Movement of the ball up and down the field is determined by the Offensive and Defensive cards.&#10;&#10;The 1925 set does not contain Time-Out cards, or mention of time-outs in the rules.  The separate board does not have any tracks for quarters or downs.  In addition to the Rules, it includes four pages of &quot;Help for the Novice&quot;, a summary of the current NCAA football rules.&#10;&#10;",

By the time the combat was over 10 hours later, 400 Zulu lay dead and they had not been able to break the spirit of the defenders.  This battle restored the honour of the British army and earned the defenders eleven Victoria Crosses, Britain's greatest award for military valour.  This number for a single battle has not been surpassed to this day.&#10;&#10;The game concentrates exclusively on the defense of the hospital (western portion).  It has few counters, a single page map which represents the western approach and the hospital, and two pages of rules.  It has three scenarios which all deal with protecting the wounded (they are represented by counters).&#10;&#10;Components must be mounted.&#10;&#10;",

The sides have dots or lines in different patterns, carved into the wooden surfaces.&#10;&#10;Each player &quot;owns&quot; a type of side, e.g. the &quot;cross&quot; or the &quot;four dots&quot; and places one cube on his turn onto the 5 x 6 grid board, starting from a corner. There are only a few rules:&#10;&#10;1. Placing a cube, the sides surface-to-surface to another cube has to have the same pattern.&#10;&#10;2. This also applies, if the cube has to fit in between two or three cubes already placed, thus limiting the possibilities.&#10;&#10;3. It is forbidden to place a cube in a way, that an adjacent cube cannot be placed. SO, sides facing a &quot;spare&quot; place are not allowed to be the same.&#10;&#10;4. There may not occur any &quot;holes&quot; on the board, so the whole grid is filled up slowly.&#10;&#10;Since you have to draw your next cube randomly, there is a &quot;luck factor&quot;, for the limitations in placement can be huge or non-existent.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;If the grid is filled up - or cannot be filled any further - the sides showing upside are counted for each player. The player with the most sides showing up is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are a lot of puzzles, too, for the 1-player-variant, and 3D-variants.&#10;&#10;One special thing about this game is, that you can also play it blindfold or with blind people.&#10;&#10;",
