Pieces represent ships and as the players move around the board, they draw cards relating to getting drinks on shore leave. Squares on the board and cards instruct players how many drinks to take. The first player to return all of his ships to the port is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

In this expansion for Stupiduel there are 40 new Modifiers; enough to make your original deck a full 50/50 collection of Modifiers and Items!&#10;&#10;But wait, there&rsquo;s more! They also enjoyed your original ideas (didn&rsquo;t read the rules) and clever gambits (cheating) so much that we&rsquo;re adding 20 new &quot;Trick&quot; cards to mix things up!&#10;&#10;",

Each player gets an additional card with a child wearing four pieces of clothing and has to find them on the lines. But the cards can only be taken off the side facing the player, and he or she can only see the back side of these. In each turn, a regular and a color die are rolled. The rotary line is rotated by as many sides as the regular die determines, then a card with a pin in the color die's color can be taken off. So it's all about memorizing where which piece is. The first player to collect all four cards of a set is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

That thing is honour.&rdquo; - Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs J&oacute;zef Beck, 5th of May, 1939&#10;&#10;September 1st, 1939. Germany invades Poland in the early morning hours. The Germans employ highly mobile massed tank formations, closely supported by mobile artillery and their airforce - the Luftwaffe. The world would come to know this warfare as the &ldquo;Blitzkrieg&rdquo;. As the Polish forces are being driven back, they are ordered to mass together near the Romanian border, where they will try to hold out until the Allies invade Germany from the West. But then the Soviets surprise attack the Poles from the East, cutting through their weakly defended border and fullfilling their secret pact with Germany to split Poland between their two nations.&#10;&#10;Price of Honour, is an expansion game which requires either of the award winning games - Awakening the Bear! and/or Storms of Steel!&#10;Players are presented with the same tactical dilemmas and decisions that commanders faced during some of the most ferocious engagements of WWII.&#10;Conflict of Heroes (CoH) follows the evolution of modern tactics, from WWII to the present.

    "Description": "A simply and funny  business game, Urs Hostettler created for the &quot;Migros Genossenschaft Bern&quot;. Migros is the largest supermarket-enterprise in Switzerland. The game was part of the annual business rapport, every member of the cooperative got one. The game was never sold in shops. The rules were written in the business rapport, and there were some funny materials like phone keys or dowels coming with the rapport. The paper of the rapport was perforated, so you could tear the papers and use it for the game.&#10;&#10;In the game, every player is owner of a Migros Store and has to buy and sells products. Prices are changing depending on supply and demand. You can also invest in propaganda and good relationships. The players write their offers and prices simultaneous on a secret paper. When players want to buy goods, the one with the highest offer can buy first. If they want to sell, the one is the lowest price sells first.&#10;&#10;Basic game mechanism is close to Executive Decision.&#10;&#10;",

It is more a game about economics and game theory than about China and its neighbors, however. Routes in &#232;&#178;&#191;&#230;&#152;&#147;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#232;&#183;&#175; (M&agrave;oy&igrave;zh&#196;&#171;l&ugrave; - trade roads), the 'trade roads' of the title are chains of trading posts / inns etc. that you as a merchant can choose to use. All trade roads can be used by all players. Shipping fees are payed to the 'shipping company' that controls that trade road. There's shipping by sea as well, which works a tiny little bit differently.&#10;&#10;The players, rich merchants, decide which shipping company invests where and how. They do this by buying cubes of the color of that shipping company. The cubes bought can be put on the map as sections of trade roads (or harbors), or they can be kept in the player's stock as 'influence' in that shipping company. The profits of a shipping company are divided by ratio of such influence cubes. Hence, owning more cubes means a larger share of the profit. However, a shipping company can only make a profit if it has many trade roads, many cubes on the map. Therefore, cube hoarders get a large share of nothing, and a player that spends all his cubes on roads gets a tiny share or even nothing of - potentially - a lot.&#10;&#10;Of course, the profit a shipping company makes is entirely dependent on whether the roads (and harbors) of that company are actually used. Players decide what to ship from what location to what other location. Of course, the choice is driven by profit maximization.&#10;There are 10 locations on the map. 7 of these are Chinese cities. The other 3 are foreign locations. In all locations, three (out of five total) goods are traded. Prices are set randomly at the beginning of the game, but after that they depend on trade. Buying goods in a market makes the price of that good increase. Selling goods in a market makes the price of that good decrease.&#10;&#10;And, rather importantly, all players (secretly) plan their trades at the same time. Plans are revealed simultaneously, and then carried out one after the other. Only after all players have made their trades, the market prices change.&#10;&#10;",

You also have 'chance' cards and 'pig in a poke' cards - in the latter you find a question that you should answer - or get minus 1 point.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Global Financial Meltdown of 2008 is widely considered the greatest shock to the world financial system since the Great Depression fueled by a perfect storm of speculation in the housing market, the mismanagement of hedge funds and a lax regulatory atmosphere.  In short, pure unbridled greed.&#10;&#10;This game allows you to enter the mayhem as a speculator with immense influence in the affairs of major United States banks heavily invested in real estate throughout the country.  Your aim is to invest in these regional banks and build them up.  If the banks get large enough, you begin to score points for your efforts.  However, as the game wears on, events in the world threaten your more ambitious investments and other major financiers may also decide to make risky investments that run counter to your interests.  Likewise, it is also possible for the end of the bubble to never come in this game - and the same investments that can bring about your own downfall may very well make you a very rich person indeed.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over four turns or quarters.  The game ends prematurely if three banks fail or the financial system fails.&#10;&#10;This game is print and play and can be found at:&#10;&#10;http://www.jkntech.com/blog/page/Downturn-Board-Game.aspx&#10;&#10;",

Players start as one of these tribal kingdoms anywhere on this map and compete with each other and with neutral kingdoms to unify Japan, or to build the strongest (winning) kingdom of Wa at least.&#10;&#10;The game borrows some mechanics and ideas from Civilization / Advanced Civilization, but there are unrelated mechanics as well, and a lot has been adapted to the smaller spatial scale and to the two/three-player limit. Trade is different, development is different, movement is different, to mention just a few, but still it feels a somewhat similar to Tresham's games that inspired 'Kings of Wa'.&#10;&#10;The game is still a prototype. The three-player expansion has not been tested much, and the characteristics of the civilization / advance cards may need further tweaking based on more playtesting.&#10;&#10;",

Resources may be kept track on paper, but it is suggested to use a token system (like Poker Chips) in order to do this.&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;System Vector was designed to be printed using Photos, and all printables are 4x6 inches, and are high-resolution. This keeps ink costs down, and makes things easy to carry and store.

The emphasis is on unit morale and cohesion rather than casualty generation.  While this is an ideal that many rule sets acknowledge, these rules actually collapse both missile and close combat into the morale phase.  Movement by units are quite limited, 'arthritic' in the designers' words.  This, too, makes the games move more quickly while remaining faithful to the tactical systems used in large-scale land warfare in Europe during this period.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed for figures at the smaller end of the scale range.  Units are brigades of two elements each.  Figures already based for DBx rules need not be rebased.&#10;&#10;First version rules (2001) are available online for free.&#10;&#10;",

This will allow you to test drive the Rebel Yell system in general and the upcoming game in particular, at no cost.&#10; Tha game is about one of the most lopsided victories in the war for the Confederates. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a threat to General Sherman's vulnerable and strung out supply line during his Georgia March to the Sea in 1864.&#10; A detachment of 8000 Union soldiers, a mix of cavalry &amp; infantry, were sent to eliminate Forrest's troops.&#10; The over eager young Union officer, Samuel Sturgis, sent his cavalry over 7 miles in front of his infantry.&#10; Forrest predicted the battle's outcome early that day to one of his generals. He stated that their Confederate cavalry would drive the Union cavalry back in a rout and push them into the tired Union infantry slogging their way towards the battlefield. His prediction was true as the Union cavalry quickly broke and retreated right back into the confused infantry. The infantry could not organize a stand in the panicked retreat of the horsemen. The Union troops were routed and suffered casualties that exceed the CSA losses by 3 to 1.&#10; In the end though, Forrest was not able to interfere with the supply line of Sherman's army, so in this, Sherman's goal was accomplished.&#10; This game comes with 2 scenarios, the simplified rules, 2 maps (in four pieces), counter images and needed charts. A 10 sided die will need to be supplied. The counters will need to be mounted on cardboard.&#10; Scenario 1 is Forrest Attacks! It depicts the initial routing of the US cavalry and is played on map 1.&#10; Scenario 2 is Drive on Brice's Store and is played on map 2. &#10;The 2 scenarios can be played as a 'campaign' game. This would require the CSA player to win both or the Union will be victorious.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Historically, this attack, along with some French shocked the Germans. Originally, the attack was to have occurred on the 22nd, when other French units near Cambrai and their 7th Army south of Amiens were to attack. Due to confusion, the British went alone, while the Cambrai attack occurred on the 22nd and almost retook the city. The 7th Army historically was near ready but failed to attack until days later when it did not matter. The &ldquo;what if&rdquo; in this game is a simple one: the planned attack slated for the 22nd with the British and French at Arras, while French units near Cambrai were also part of the attack from Arras instead, and its 7th Army south of Amiens went on the coordinated offensive to cut off the panzer divisions in the 40 mile wide corridor.&#10;&#10;Each turn is six hours.

    "Description": "A dice and card game based on the RUNEQUEST runes. Designed for 3-10 players, PANTHEONS gets better the more people that play. Appropriate for the entire family, ages 10 and up.&#10;Six specialty dice&#10;163 card deck&#10;Scoresheets&#10;Rulebook&#10;Scenario folder and charts&#10;&#10;The dice and cards show 32 different RUNEQUEST runes which regulate play. Each player represents a Deity. Each player has unique play abilities and victory conditions. The object is to outplay your competitor Gods and reach your maximum Attribute points &ndash; thereby ruling the Gloranthan PANTHEON!&#10;There are 5 different Attributes. You begin with one Minor God and may acquire more &ndash; Minor Gods allow you to take Attribute Points from the other Deities. Every turn, each player rolls the dice and draws/plays cards to earn more Points. Cards can be saved to advance questing Heroes to Minor God status or used against your opponents to take Points. Playing time is 1 - 4 hours depending on how many players you have. 3-4 players takes 1-1.5 hours [less for experienced players], while 10 players is more of a party atmosphere that can go for up to 4 hours [again-usually much less for experienced players].&#10;&#10;The original version of this game was produced in 1984 under License / Permission from Greg Stafford and the CHAOSIUM. Less than 300  were ever printed. Over 250 copies were sold. I have an archive copy &ndash; the last one. Currently, artwork is being prepared for a 25th Anniversary Limited Edition printing.&#10;&#10;",
