    "Description": "Viewpoint in a non-collectible card game produced by the Australian game design company 93 Made Games.  The game contents consist of a deck of 70 cards, each illustrated in a &lsquo;70s/&lsquo;80s retro art style, and a rule sheet, attractively packaged in a small black cardboard box.  Most of what you need to know is printed on the cards themselves and makes picking up and getting into the game very easy.  The use of icons on the cards, representing different aspects of the game (e.g. the discard pile, the play area and your hand of cards), makes the game even easier to understand.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2 to 6 players of ages 7 and up.  Games can take as little as 5 minutes or as long as 30 minutes to play - depending on the experience of players and the number of players in each game.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to be the first player with 100 points down on the table, which isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds.  Players have cards that can steal cards you have tabled or send them to the discard pile.  So you need to be able to judge the best time to put cards on the table and how to defend your cards once they are down.&#10;&#10;Game-play is highly interactive and the base rules are simple to follow to make it accessible to casual and non-gamers as well as dedicated gamers.  At the start of play, each person is dealt a hand of five cards.  These cards each have values clearly printed on them, ranging from negative amounts to a maximum of 20 points.  They also have actions printed on them, along with a graphic (which features some pun on vision such as &lsquo;wink&rsquo; or &lsquo;blind spot&rsquo;).  The action associated with an individual card is usually executed as you attempt to put the card face up into your play area (known as your Field of View).  There are a few cards (such as Spectacles) that allow you to play the card as a reaction to other players trying to affect your cards.&#10;&#10;While your first few games of Viewpoint might not appear to involve a high degree of skill for winning, you will soon discover that you need to be much more strategic about how and when you play your cards, as well as keeping a careful eye on what people have got down on the table.  Simply placing cards into your Field of View won&rsquo;t win you the game, as other players will start targeting you as you hit a score of around 80+. You need think &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; and bluff your opponents, by sitting on a &lsquo;non-threatening&rsquo; score, while searching for cards that will let you steal cards or take multiple turns, allowing you to suddenly win the game by coming from behind.&#10;&#10;The design of the game system provides an entertaining and interactive experience encouraging replayability.  The games system also provides the opportunity to release future expansion packs of cards to add to the mischief already present in the base deck.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Bid-It! is the bidding game where your hand doesn&rsquo;t really matter, as long as you know how to bid it!&#10;&#10;The object of Bid-It! is to bid how many of a given number appear on the cards held by all players together. For instance, a bid of &ldquo;four 5&rsquo;s&rdquo; means the bidder believes that there are at least four fives being held by all players as a group. The next player must either make a higher bid or challenge the previous bid. Once a bid is challenged, the cards are revealed. If the bid was too high, the bidder loses a card. If not, the challenger loses a card. Players try to figure out each other&rsquo;s hands by their bids, but remember, bluffing is not only legal, it&rsquo;s sometimes quite effective (unless you get challenged!)&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re very sure that your opponent&rsquo;s bid was too high, why not bid &ldquo;double&rdquo; and put the loss of 2 cards on the line? Of course, the bidder may turn the tables on you and &ldquo;redouble&rdquo;. Or if you think that your opponent&rsquo;s bid was exactly right, take a chance and bid &ldquo;Perfecto!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Includes 110 cards and instructions in a colorful metal tin.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Perudo&#10;&#10;",

Each continent is connected by portals, the primary gateways between city-states that reside on these continents. Warlords command Guardians to lead armies through the portals on quests to conquer and control each other's lands.&#10;&#10;The many continents are filled with races of all types, from Orcs, Goblins, Dwarves, Skeletons, Elves, Humans, as well as new races, such as the Celethreals and Boneshadows. While once in harmony with each other, the peace of the countryside has since been destroyed as portals open with armies pouring in from unknown continents.&#10;&#10;What Guardians will protect your lands?&#10;&#10;Guardians of Graxia will be released this summer as both a board game and a PC online-downloadable version. The game features dynamic strategic gameplay using more than 240 unique and spell cards, figurines, and map tiles in a fantasy-based environment. Heroes of Graxia is being released at the same time and is a Deck-Building Card Game version of the Graxia world.&#10;&#10;Guardians of Graxia will support both single and multiplayer gameplay as well.&#10;&#10;",

As you explore your mountainside made of cards you will encounter rockslides, yetis, and danger at every turn!&#10;&#10;You start with a deck of 18 mountain cards, laying out 15 of them face down in a pyramidal mountain and keeping the rest as your backpack. Each card has a yin or yang value of 1-4 on it as well as a special effect. To start the game, each player reveals a card in their bottom row, carries out the effect, then places their meeple on the card.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you explore an adjacent card on a non-lower level by flipping it over, carrying out its effects, and placing your meeple on it; trade a card from your backpack with a card in your mountain, pacing the replaced card in a cache; or hide a card, which is the same as trade, but on another player's mountain. If your face-up mountain cards have a balance of yin and yang, you can remove them from play.&#10;&#10;Once you reach the mountain's peak, you add your cache to your hand, then you can spend your turns doing nothing, dropping cards from your cache face up on the mountain to better balance your yin and yang, and throwing cache cards onto another player's mountain, who then flips up one of your remaining face-down cards.&#10;&#10;In the competitive game, when everyone is at the peak, players score 3, 2, and 1 flags based on who is most balanced, with ties being broken in favor of whoever ascended their mountain first; play multiple rounds until someone collects nine flags and wins. In the co-operative game, you end the game after everyone has scaled their mountain, and you all win only if everyone has an even yin-yang balance.&#10;&#10;There are also rule books for Cooperative, Solo, and Team play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players command four fantasy races in Kings Under Mountains &mdash; orcs, dwarves, goblins and giants &mdash; and they use these creatures to secure mines up for grabs, then develop those mines. Why would they do this for you? Because you're the king of one of these races, that's why!&#10;&#10;Each card in the 80-card deck is double-sided; one side depicts a creature from one of the four races and a numerical value (0-9), while the other side depicts a mine with a defense value, a size value, and a point value. To start the game, shuffle the deck, lay out four mines, deal each player a hand of six cards, then lay out four cards creature-side-up to form the Camp; group like creatures on top of one another. Each player also receives a King card to show which race he represents.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he must play a creature on (1) a mine currently up for grabs or (2) a mine that he's previously claimed. In both cases, the creature being played must have a higher number than the creature currently on top of the stack &mdash; except for a 0, which can be played on a 9. In the former case, you can play a card of any race, while in the latter case you can't play a card of your own race! When the number of cards on an available mine matches that mine's defense value, the King of the race on the card last played claims the mine. (If that race isn't in the game, whoever played the card claims the mine.) Move all of the cards played into the Camp.&#10;&#10;When the number of cards on a claimed mine matches that mine's size, discard all of the creature cards to the Camp, then place the mine under your King &mdash; unless the mine bears an overseer symbol, in which case you need to first play a creature of your own race on top of the creatures developing the mine (following the rule for how to play cards) before you can score the mine and place it under your King.&#10;&#10;To end your turn, you refill your hand to six cards by drawing the top card from the deck or from one of the four race piles in the Camp. When the deck runs out, the game ends. Players score points for all of the mine cards that they've fully developed (that is, mine cards under their King), then lose points for mines claimed but not yet developed. The player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

The new Combat Results Table better reflects the attritional aspects of combat on the Eastern Front, while certain anomalies arising out of the sequence of play have been eliminated. The opportunity has also been taken to introduce more elegant air and supply systems, which will be functional for the series as a whole. Unit types include bridging, motorcycle infantry, combat engineers, rocket artillery, anti-aircraft units, etc., &mdash; as well as the more standard armor, mechanized and infantry units. Supply, weather and terrain all play their part, as do fortifications, strong points (these can be built each turn), air power, artillery, reinforcements and replacements, HQ units and reserves.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 km&#10;Unit: Company to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Seven dual-side printed countersheets (1,040 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 48-page East Front Battles Series rulebook &#10;One 32-page Spires of the Kremlin rulebook &#10;Four Player Aid cards &#10;1 10-sided die&#10;&#10;Player: 2 or more&#10;Complexity: Medium-High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium-High&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 10 hours, depending upon scenario; up to 40 hours for the Campaign Game&#10;&#10;",

The Master chooses two cards from her/his hand and places them face up on the table. These two cards become the Mobscenity Roots. The Master then states what the Mobscenity Phrase will be by combining the two terms. For example, if the Master plays the cards &ldquo;Wax&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dolphin,&rdquo; the Master can state the Mobscenity Phrase is &ldquo;Waxing the Dolphin.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The other players are given 3 minutes to write both 1) a definition of the Obscenity Phrase and 2) a sentence that includes the Obscenity Phrase (the Master can decide to boot people from the round if they do not finish on time). When the time is up, each player folds up their written response and puts it in the hat. Players take turns reading the responses, and the Master decides which response s/he likes the best. The player with the best response gets 1 point.&#10;&#10;",

The game lasts 8 rounds.  Everyone starts with a hand of 9 Teamwork cards (1-9) and each turn plays one card that will indicate how much effort you are going to put into the project, and consequently what order you will get to choose the research cards on offer.  Teamwork cards are chosen and revealed simultaneously.  If both team members play the same card they automatically lose ! Then Teammates add up their total teamwork effort for the Team Total, and the Team with the highest Total chooses first with the player in that team who played the highest card taking the pick and keeping it for himself.  Then the lowest card player in the losing team goes next.  So if you care about the cards on offer you either want to persuade your partner to play high (and play higher than him) or persuade him to go low (and go lower than him) but never risk playing the same card as him.&#10;&#10;At it's best G.Nome is for 4 players with each game having a change of partners and the highest cumulative score winning overall.&#10;&#10;",

On the room boards there are 5 empty spaces for the &quot;Hideouts&quot;.&#10;Players receive randomly 5 hideout counters each and place them &ldquo;covered&rdquo; in front of them.&#10;Finally all kittens are placed in the garden which is in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get rid of all the hideout counters before your opponents. Each counter should be placed on its appropriate slot, according to the shape and color of the room.&#10;How to do it? Each turn a player move his own cat (the one corresponding to the color of his room&rsquo;s frame) and according to the his counters he chooses the room where hiding the cat. If he chooses his own room then he can place the cat on any slot of his choice. But if he chooses to move his cat to a room controlled by an opponent, it&rsquo;s up to the owner to choose where to place it.&#10;&#10;When your cat is placed on a slot that corresponds to one of your hideout counters (according to the shape and color of the room), discover it and place it on the corresponding position; but remember, each room cannot host more than one cat because they are not willing to share a territory. If you place your cat on a board occupied by another cat, the brawl starts.&#10;&#10;After this phase starts the &ldquo;Housekeeper moment&ldquo;.&#10;The current player rolls a die. All players compete to grab the matching colored kitten, wherever it is. The fastest hand moves the caught kitten to the garden and pass one of his remained counters, of his choice, to the player with less counters. If there are 2 or more opponents with the same number of counters left, he can choose the target. However he can never pass his last counter, which must necessarily be placed on the appropriate slot.&#10;&#10;The first player that remains with no hideout counters is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

If you cannot claim a card, place your played card on a pile, leaving all numbers in the pile visible.&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, sum the values of the cards you've claimed.

These chips can be used to get help from the citys former master-detective if the player has a hard time in figuring out the clues.  &#10;When the player thinks he or she has the correct answer they move to the police-station as quickly as possible and once there they get to write down their guesses.

Driven only by your courage, you decide to follow in the footsteps of those first explorers and launch a worldwide expedition, but you're not the only one on this quest...&#10;&#10;In Lost Explorers, each player starts with five figures on their research team: two leaders to track your discoveries, and three members to gain equipment and go on expeditions. On your turn, you can place members on one or both equipment areas to gain tokens; placing one figure means you retrieve the first token from the pile, two figures the second token, etc. The visible side of a token represents a vehicle &mdash; a train (red), a car (yellow), a boat (blue), or an airship (green) &mdash; while the hidden side depicts two or three locations on the world map. For each token you take, choose whether to keep the vehicle side face up or flip it over to reveal the mission side of the token. Once you choose, the token is locked, and you place it in front of you with your other vehicle and mission tokens.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, instead of collecting equipment you can place members on map locations. Each location shows 2-3 vehicle tiles, and you must have all depicted tiles in front of you to place a member on a location. Each time you place a member, choose one of the vehicle tokens used, then place it in the discard pile next to the box. (If you travel to the location of another player's member, you instead give them the discarded token.)&#10;&#10;After you either collect vehicle/mission tokens or send members on expeditions, you can complete one or more missions if you have a member on each of the 2-3 locations depicted on that mission. For each mission, remove one of your members just used from the board, then advance the appropriate leader on the discovery track for the color of the mission and the number of members used. (Each game, 2-4 locations are marked as &quot;validated&quot;, and a validated location is always completed automatically for missions, but you score no points for it.) If you advanced your leader who was behind on the discovery track, take a vehicle token from the discard pile and add it to your collection.&#10;&#10;When one of your leaders reaches a &quot;clue&quot; spot on a discovery track, you collect a clue token. If you collect four clue tokens first, you win! Alternatively, the game ends once all the vehicle tokens have been claimed, at which point the player who has advanced the farthest on the discovery track with their slower leader wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players then travel around the outer ring buying the things they need, and marking them off of the project cards. When the player has one or more project cards filled they can move into the inner ring and go to the room the project is for. A rating card is drawn (1-4) and a description of the project is read. The back of the project card contains four different outcomes for the project ranging from spectacular to horrible, these match the rating card and instruct the player what benefit they get from their project. Each project can add equity to your house. The first player to increase the equity of their house by $50,000 wins the game.&#10;&#10;This is a fun lighthearted look at home improvements.

However no-one survives in the desert alone - each camel must always be adjacent to at least one other camel.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts a desert with a starting area in one corner and a finish area in the opposite corner. There are two oasis spaces in the middle of the desert and a gorge which approximately splits the desert in two.&#10;&#10;After the initial placement of the pieces in the starting area, each player rolls all six of the dice, and moves whichever camels they want - restricted by the rule that a camel may never be by itself, but must have at least another camel in one of the 4 adjacent spaces (diagonal spaces do not count). The die roll determines how a camel may move: A 1 allows one space of diagonal or horizontal movement; a 2,3,or 4 allows the camel to move in a straight line (but not diagonally) that many spaces - it may also jump over any intervening camels; a 5 or 6 allows the camel to move that number of spaces and allows one right angle turn in the move - it may also jump over any intervening pieces.&#10;&#10;Being the first person to move a camel onto an oasis earns the player bonus points, and also being the first person to move a camel past the gorge likewise earns a player bonus points. These bonus points are added to the points earned by your camel's finishing position (ie 8 points to the first camel to get to the finish line, 6 for the second camel and 4 for the third).&#10;&#10;The person with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

As in xiangqi, it is played on the vertices of the grid. The board is divided into two lang territories by a river in the middle of the board. The three files on one side of the board form the sea. The object of the game is to capture the opponent's Commander, or all units of a single division of the opponent's army.&#10;&#10;The pieces on both sides, with their abbreviations, movements, and rules, are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 Commander (C): moves any distance orthogonally; captures 1 point orthogonally; may occupy Headquarters; may not &quot;see&quot; the opposing Commander on an open file&#10;     2 Infantry (I): 1 point orthogonally&#10;     2 Tanks (T): 2 points orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter, remaining stationary; carries C, In, or M&#10;     1 Militia (M): 1 point orthogonally&#10;     2 Engineer (E): 1 point orthogonally; carries all pieces, only across river; controls airspace 1 point any direction&#10;     2 Artillery (A): 1&ndash;3 points any direction; crosses river only at reefs, by attacking, or carried&#10;     2 Anti-aircraft gun (AA): 1 point orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter; controls airspace 1 point any direction&#10;     1 Missile Rocket (R): 1&ndash;2 points orthogonally or 1 point diagonally; controls airspace as it moves&#10;     2 Air force (AF): 1&ndash;4 points any direction; may return to its departing point after capturing or carrying, unless capturing opposing Af; carries C, In, or M; destroyed immediately on passing through opposing airspace&#10;     2 Navy (N): 1-4 points any direction on sea, sea banks, and river banks; captures as it moves at sea; shoots 1&ndash;3 in any direction at land targets; controls airspace 1 point any direction&#10;     2 Commander Base (B): stationary and does not capture; may house only C; protects C, but not itself, from In, M, Aa, and Ms&#10;&#10;&#10;General rules:&#10;&#10;     Pieces capture as they move, and never jump, unless noted.&#10;     Pieces can cross the river but not occupy sea points unless noted.&#10;     Pieces which check the opposing Commander are promoted, gaining special abilities.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Chinese xiangqi has generally been the most popular form of chess played in Vietnam. In fact, there is no traditional distinctively-Vietnamese chess game; which is partly what inspired C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh.&#10;&#10;C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh is played on the vertices of an 11x12 &quot;geographic&quot; board similar to the 9x10 xiangqi board, with the addition of an ocean occupying files A&ndash;C and two &quot;reefs&quot; allowing all pieces to ford the river. It shares many features with wargames, including area denial, ranged attack, and unit cooperation.&#10;&#10;Besides the fact that Vietnam has never had a distinctive regional form of chess, Nguy&#225;&#187;&#133;n noted four complaints with xiangqi influenced the creation of C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh:&#10;&#10;1. Xiangqi promotes individualism and class conflict, particularly in the willingness of players to sacrifice low-level pieces to succeed.&#10;2. Winning xiangqi is due more to luck than to intellect.&#10;3. Xiangqi does not reflect the geography and history of Vietnam.&#10;4. Xiangqi has many rule variantions, none of which are accepted by the entire community.&#10;&#10;Each of these points is answered in C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh:&#10;&#10;1. Pieces cooperate through a &quot;carrying&quot; and area denial mechanics. As well, losing an entire class of piece loses the game, forcing protection of and cooperation among all classes.&#10;2. Nguy&#225;&#187;&#133;n believes the interactions between pieces and influence of geography necessitate more strategy and reduce the role of luck.&#10;3. Besides the single river of xiangqi, there is an ocean, as well as &quot;reefs&quot; across the river, all of which interact with special piece rules. Besides the Vietnam-like geography, the pieces modern rather than ancient military structure.&#10;4. By promoting C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh educational programs, Nguy&#225;&#187;&#133;n hopes to ensure that a single authoritative set of rules is used by all players.&#10;&#10;",

As a rail baron in the 1880's American West, you try to expand your railroad empire by moving goods and passengers between cities. You may invest in new trains and stations or upgrade your trains to make them go faster and carry more goods. Buy goods where they are cheap and sell them where they fetch the best price. But beware: Gangs of desperadoes hired by rival rail barons will try to hold up and rob your trains, or blow up the tracks to derail you.&#10;&#10;A roll-and-move game where you each turn will roll three dice; your large trains will move the sum of all the dice, your small trains the sum of the two highest dice and your gang of desperadoes the highest die. Pay to pick up goods in cities (small trains may carry one good while large trains may carry two) or pick up passengers for free. Deliver goods and passengers to the cities accepting them, your profit will depend on how far you moved the goods. Goods available for buying and selling are fixed for the different cities and prices are pre-printed on the board. If an opponent's train pass your gang of desperadoes you will rob the train if you roll higher on a die than your opponent does (trains cannot change direction and are forced to use the entire die roll and hence you can maneuver to force them into your ambush). Other features are &quot;telegrams&quot; (a la community chest cards), marshals and sticks of dynamite...&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first to reach a given number of &quot;success points&quot; (victory points), which you get for buying trains and stations and for cash in hand.&#10;&#10;",

Pitting Brawn, Speed, and Wits against one another as you chase mayhem around the city-grid.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a small box 'filler' game.&#10;&#10;The game starts by randomly dividing the 18 cards, of which there are 9 green villain cards and 9 white hero cards.  Whichever color you get a majority of will determine which Super you are.  (You play cards of both colors, and you always know exactly which cards your nemesis has remaining in hand)&#10;&#10;The Board is a 6x6 grid and each round the dice are used to find a space on it where 'Mayhem' happens.  Players move and play a card face down after the first die roll (before the exact location of Mayhem is known), and then move again after the second die roll.&#10;&#10;Players can end in 3 configurations- Sharing a space, one player at the mayhem, or neither player at the mayhem.  Each configuration results in 1 of 3 showdowns (Brawn, Speed, and Wits, respectively) where cards resolve differently.&#10;-Sometimes the high card wins, sometimes a Decoy wins, and sometimes cards of the same color are lost.&#10;&#10;Victorious cards are set by one side of the board, and defeated cards are set by another.  Win when there are 5 victory cards of your color, or 5 defeated cards of your nemesis' color.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to anticipate what your opponent will do, and to trick him into thinking he knows what you're up to.&#10;&#10;",

On his turn he will play one of the cards in his hand. Usually he will play them in his own tableaux in one of three piles, votes (orange), money (green) and influence (purple). The person with the most votes at the end of the game is the winner, but you will need money and influence to be able to play the cards with the most votes. Sadly, the cards representing the strongest money and influence have the whiff of corruption about them, and if an opponent sees corruption in your tableaux, he can use the press to strip you of said money/influence.&#10;&#10;Game ends when all cards have been played.&#10;&#10;",

The squares on the outer board are jobs, and the squares on the middle board are apartments. You can take as many jobs as you want, but each one slows you down, making it harder to get to Payday. Money doesn't really matter anyway; the real point of the game is to spend four months in the terrifying center ring. Not that they necessarily have to be four months in a row....&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the game of &#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#171; (ButaBabel), you are a pig who takes charge of building your Tower of Babel (&quot;Buta&quot; means Pig in Japanese). Your duty is to build a higher tower than everyone else.&#10;&#10;Each card has one of rock-paper-scissors symbol. You can easily increase the height of your tower by placing a card from your hand onto your pile of cards, so that your card can defeat the top card of that pile.&#10;&#10;But if you have built your tower too much higher than your opponents, the God gets angry and destroys your tower.&#10;&#10;You can also raise opponents' towers in the same manner, so you should watch every tower and keep your tower at moderate height, though this game proceeds in real time so fast that you don't have enough time to watch closely.&#10;&#10;When the players have exhausted the decks, the round ends and players compare towers by counting the cards stacked in each. In a three-player game, there is a fourth dummy tower as well. The tallest tower wins, unless it is three or more cards higher than the next highest tower. If it is too high, it's eliminated (tying towers likewise). Then compare the next highest tower to see if it is too high and so on. This way, it is possible for the dummy player to win.&#10;&#10;The game is published with Japanese and English rules.&#10;&#10;ButaBabel was re-issued in 2016 as a new version &#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#171; (Onibaberu).&#10;&#10;    This game is based on the Touhou Project video game.&#10;    The contents of the game are the same as Butababeru (only the art is different).&#10;&#10;&#10;Players become tengus and kappas that have been invited to a banquet of demons. Your goal is to drink just the right amount of alcohol and get home as fast as you can, before you can&rsquo;t leave at all!&#10;&#10;The drinking is the easy part. All you do is stack up the cards in the way the rules tell you. But, drink too much and the demons will take a liking to you, and you won't be allowed to leave!&#10;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t want a drink that&rsquo;s made its way to your hand, you can also force the other players to take drink cards. Keep a close eye on your banquet buddies to make sure you don&rsquo;t end up with too many drinks! Know your limit and drink just the right amount.&#10;&#10;Those who drink too much drop out of the game, but those who don&rsquo;t drink enough won&rsquo;t please the demons, so balance is

Then they are questioned. The witnesses are on cards in a 2-witness-row and a 3-witness-row. As soon as a witness card row is full a suspect must be arrested and brought to the police. Those are then held in the police headquarters in a row of 3 and a row of 4. A full row means one of the suspect gets removed and he/she is the murderer...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Thrown is a trick-taking game with a new way to play into a trick, namely by using dice! The colors of the dice represent the suits. The lead player rolls 1-3 dice of a color (the suit), then the other players try to roll in-suit to get the highest value on the table. If you do not have the right suit, then you can roll for trump; rolling a natural 6 on one of your dice in an off-suit will beat the highest value in-suit.&#10;&#10;Winning a trick gives you gold. The game ends following a number of rounds played equal to the number of players, at which time whoever has the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;But wait, there are cards in the game, too! These cards give special abilities which are paid for, or activated with, dice of particular colors. Some of the effects include flipping your dice or an opponent's dice to their opposite sides, removing dice, re-rolling dice, and automatically winning with a particular roll!&#10;&#10;",

As soon as the board rocks away from you, it can rock back! Place the Game Tray on the playing surface between players. Players take the balls of their color and place them into their ball holder trays. The game begins when a player draws one of the uniquely designed challenge cards and faces it up. Each player tries to tries bounce their balls into the tray to match the design on the card. Players keep bouncing until somebody matches the design, and then that player takes the card!

The other players watch his groping through a clear opening in the dome.  A card is collected only when the last piece is drawn.  Points are awarded for pieces drawn and cards collected with a bonus for having a complete set.&#10;&#10;",
