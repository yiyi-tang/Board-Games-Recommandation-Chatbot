Each player or team (the 4-player game is for teams) takes a color of chips, white or black.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player spins a spinner which produces a result from 0-5 in one of the board colors or white.  If the color is pink or a friendly color, the player places markers in the number of spaces shown.  If an opposing color, the player may choose to place the opposing markers on the board.  If white, the player takes opposing markers off the board.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of four possible conditions are met - one team controls the main diagonal of the board, one team controls all squares of their colors, etc.  None of these conditions automatically win the game, but some add points to the team's score.&#10;&#10;",

The first die determines if players get to move their Schlammh&uuml;pfers or the Schmunzelmonster (&#226;&#133;&#148; chance). The second die determines how far they must move. &#10;On a player's turn, if they still have a Schlammh&uuml;pfer in the safety of their burrow, they need to move it out before they may move another one on the board. Schlammh&uuml;pfer can cover quite a lot of distance because they skip occupied spots. That is needed, however, to get away from the ravenous monster.&#10;&#10;The player with the last Schlammh&uuml;pfer remaining wins the game. Schmunzelmonster is a beautiful and colorful game for ages 6 and up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trinity is a New Zealand designed and published abstract strategy game for 2 players.  The game is played on a 4 by 4 square grid, which is marked a-d on the horizontal axis and 1-4 on the vertical axis for record keeping.&#10;&#10;There are three types of pieces, which are identical for black and white.  First are the ORBS, which are circular pieces with red, yellow, green or blue in the center. The second type of pieces are ARCS, which have a stripe of color matching those of the orbs.  The arcs are 120 degrees in extension, so three arcs fit around an orb.  HALOS are the third piece type, and are either white or black.  They are rings which fit outside the orbs and arcs.  There are four orbs, four arcs and six halos of each color, made of plastic.&#10;&#10;The orbs are set up on the 1 and 4 rows with the matching color arcs with those orbs.  Play consists of each player moving one orb one square horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  The matching color of arc MUST be then moved.  Arcs can move to any other legal square on the board.&#10;&#10;The easiest way to win is to trap an opposing orb with three arcs of any color around it (an Arc-win).  If you can box in your opponents orbs so that he has no valid moves, then you have gained an Orb-win.  Finally, if you can move your four pieces inside four halos of your own color you have completed a halo win.  A draw is an option through player agreement or stalemate from repeated moves.&#10;&#10;A halo is &quot;earned&quot; by moving three of your arcs so that they form a complete ring, with no orbs inside it.  The arcs then attack the opposing pieces of the same strip color as the arcs.&#10;&#10;The game rules come in a 16-page A6 sized rule book. There is also a CD for Windows PCs to practice strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll and move, with the requirement that they make horn sounds at certain points in the game.  The first player to reach the finish line wins.  Capital Run is a game for older children, with up to four players.  This game also has a roll-and-move mechanic, and players must successfully name state capitals in order to earn a turn, with the object to cross the country on a preset path.  Freight train is light but nontrivial game for two players, requiring players to assemble a set of different types of trains.  These trains (coal tender, box car, flat car, cattle car) begin the game on preset spaces, and players must roll around the board and assemble their set.  There are several opportunities for decisions.&#10;&#10;",

Choose your own Plays! Follow the rules of football. Players each roll dice, the numbers on the dice refer to sequence tables which determine the results of the play (one player rolls for offense, and the other rolls for defense). Before rolling the offensive player must state whether he is going to run, kick, or pass. The game consists of &quot;Four Quarters&quot; four sets of (20) plays each quarter. The player with the highest score at the end wins.&#10;&#10;Alternate version: Jr. Quarterback came with short game board, markers for downs and quarter of play, a cardboard football and a deck of 20 cards with plays. One quarter of play was one complete pass through the 20 plays card deck. Thus, the deck would be gone through twice per half and 4 times to complete one game. The offensive player would select a play. The card would be turned over to reveal the results. Following the rules of football i.e., 4 downs to gain 10 yards, 4 quarters of play, etc.) the ball would move up and down the field based on the play called and the associated gain or loss in yardage on the card associated with the play called. The plays that could be called were &quot;left end&quot;, &quot;left tackle&quot;, &quot;left guard&quot;, &quot;right end&quot;, &quot;right tackle&quot;, &quot;right guard&quot;, &quot;short pass&quot; and &quot;long pass&quot; as well as &quot;punt&quot;, &quot;kickoff&quot; and &quot;field goal&quot;. Each of the running plays had gains and losses as well as one fumble and a no gain. &quot;Long pass&quot; had four interceptions including one that was returned for a touchdown. &quot;Long pass&quot; also offered a touchdown. Short pass had a higher completion rate than long pass and only two interceptions. Jr. Quarterback is a fun game for two young players and can even be played by one. In my opinion ages elementary or for the adult who likes old school board games from a simpler time. Great game for teaching a young child the basics.&#10;&#10;",

The girls are all somehow later involved in another tragic death. The cards have point values and there is a game that can be played regardless of how many cards have collected. 8 evil puppet cards are included in the full set.&#10;&#10;More information:&#10;http://www.therss.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=41&amp;osCsid=f295fa51966c4cc1ccb021aaff82597f&#10;http://www.therss.com/creepychristine/&#10;&#10;",

Players learn how the same word can represent different parts of speech based on how it is used in a sentence.&#10; As they move around the board, drawing cards and reading sentences, players identify the parts of speech of selected words. All words are used in sentence context for meaningful learning.&#10; The Reference Sheet, included, allows players to familiarize themselves with the parts of speech. Younger players can use the Reference Sheet while playing the game.&#10; The object is to cover the most spaces on the board before one player runs out of markers. The player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game the &quot;rebel&quot; player secretly compiles a list with the opponent's  units that will mutiny, then the &quot;government&quot; player places his army and only after this stage is the list revealed.  At the end of the game the total value of the &quot;strategic goals&quot; achieved by the &quot;rebel&quot; player is calculated, and if his total score is higher than the &quot;government&quot; player's one (the sum of the objectives still under his control) the coup d'etat is successful.&quot;&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;Map of Italy (84 x 39,5 cm) with reference charts embedded;&#10;107 cardboards chits;&#10;1 dice;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Cribbage - The Board Game&rdquo; is a simple, fast game for anyone who enjoys playing the traditional cribbage card game. Unlike the traditional card game, the board game can only be played with two teams and therefore cannot be played by three players. Fortunately (and uniquely) this cribbage game can be played very well with six players forming two teams of three. Each team alternates play by placing a card on the board from their dealt hand. The board is a five by five grid with a face down card in the center revealed only after all cards are played. At the end of each round one team will score the cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; that form the &ldquo;rows&rdquo; while the other team scores the cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; that form the &ldquo;columns&rdquo;.  Every card placed will become a card in one of your cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; on the board but will also be a card in one of your opponents &ldquo;hands&rdquo;. The trick therefore is to strategically place cards in such a way to help yourself but hinder your opponent. The board also has card values printed on some spots for instant scoring. Placing a queen on a spot on the board with a queen printed on it will score an instant two points - just as matching a pair during regular play would in a traditional cribbage game. Placing a five on the same queen spot would similarly score an instant two points for the fifteen. Final scoring is done after all spaces are filled using the same procedure one uses for a traditional cribbage hand. First team to 121 wins. If you like to play cribbage, especially with a group, this is a fun twist on one of the world&rsquo;s oldest card games.&#10;&#10;",
