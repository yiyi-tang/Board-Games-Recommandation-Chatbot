To make this game, we carefully researched the things that scare people the most. Things like Flying, Death, Public Speaking, and Family Reunions. It includes 300 beautifully photographed Fear Cards that depict the scariest, and the funniest, fears you&rsquo;ve ever seen or experienced. Up to four people can play at once&mdash;the winner is the first player to score (you guessed it) 13 points by correctly ranking the fears of the other players. You&rsquo;ll discover entirely new aspects of your friends, family&mdash;even your significant other&ndash;that you didn&rsquo;t even know existed. But best of all, Your Worse Nightmare spurs great conversations that help people start the process of facing their fears&mdash;because acknowledging and talking about fears is the first step to overcoming them. It&rsquo;s the card game that turns fear into fun!&#10;&#10;Start the game by shuffling the stack of Fear Cards and flipping over the top four. Place them face-up for everyone to see. Players then secretly rank the cards on their Scarecards in the order of what scares you the most, from 1 (the scariest) to 4 (the least scary). After jotting down your own fears, select another player to rank. Afterwards, players take turns reading their rankings. Each fear you correctly ranked earns you one point. And guessing all four fears correctly earns a bonus point. After everyone has had a turn, play starts over with four more Fear Cards. Players choose who they want to rank, but they have to rank each other player at least once. Play continues until someone reaches 13 points and wins the game! Don&rsquo;t be scared, it&rsquo;s frighteningly fun!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Vampire Werewolf Fairies you try to become four different types of people -- Vampires, Werewolves, Witches, and Fairies. The goal of the game is to collect objects to help you or hurt your opponents, and to become types that can use those objects. You can play as multiple types. At the end of the game, a fast-paced lightning round can make or break the winner.&#10;&#10;This is a game for 2-6 players. Or, it can be combined with Zombie Ninja Pirates and played with up to 10 players.&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of cards. Type cards give you points if you are that type at the end of the game. Action cards will allow you to play a quick action, such as become a Type (like the &quot;Bite&quot; card, which lets you become a Vampire), or remove a Type from another player (like &quot;Hair Remover&quot;, to remove a Werewolf type). Finally, Object cards you want to try to collect, and will give you points if you are a type that can use that Object. For example, &quot;Sparkles&quot; are +3 points for Fairies, but -3 points for Vampires, because we all know that real Vampires *don't* sparkle.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Zombie Ninja Pirates&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Such persons may challenge the alleged wrongdoer to single combat and seek retribution for any crime &mdash; or at least that's what the Ancient Law states.&#10;&#10;Ragers: Champions of the Arena is a game of wits and bluff for two players. Each player becomes a head of a team of Ragers &mdash; powerful fighters who settle disputes between tribes during the Great Thing that lasts for three days. During the game, players play cards depicting brave warriors and representing different types of attacks and special actions. By doing so, they gain glory points (GPs) over three rounds of fighting, and whoever gains the most GPs becomes victorious.&#10; Each day of the Great Thing is devoted to a different deity, and each day bloodthirsty spectators expect daring feats of strength and cunning, so the conditions of combat change constantly. It is up to players to choose the best strategy that will appease the crowd and enable them to outsmart their rival.&#10;&#10;",

Players collect resources from the game board through character actions and spend them to hire new characters and advance their tribe.&#10;&#10;Stratos has 5 character classes, each serving a distinct function. The 5 classes and their (promoted forms) are the Peasant (Cultivator), Archer (Marksman), Soldier (Knight), Explorer (Swashbuckler) and Mage (Sorcerer). Each promoted class gains expanded abilities compared to its original version. Enhanced abilities include greater attacks (Knight vs. Soldier), access to stronger spells (Sorcerer vs. Mage), improved resource harvesting (Cultivator vs. Peasant), expanded movement (Swashbuckler vs. Explorer) and increased attack accuracy (Marksman vs. Archer). Characters move from space to space on a tile-based board which can be arranged randomly or according to set maps. Each character can perform up to 2 unique actions per turn with movement being a repeatable action. Available character actions (dependent on class) include Harvest, Travel, Search, Attack, Shoot, Defend, Cast and Use.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded by defeating characters, casting unique spells, discovering treasures, hoarding resources, promoting characters and occupying key map locations.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a pre-determined number of Prosperity points (default 10) is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Stratos is a product of Board and Tale Games Inc., a Canadian boardgame publisher based in Hamilton, Ontario.&#10;&#10;",

Within the same game, each player can adapt the difficulty according to their age, so the entire family can take part in the adventure. Board together your puck aircraft and fly towards 3D Tree Cities to recover birds in need of protection from poachers.&#10;&#10;A game of Canopea consists of 5 trips to bring as many birds as possible to safety before they are captured by poachers. You begin each trip with a new mission that targets a species of bird to recover. You then must navigate between the 6 Tree Cities to find endangered birds.&#10;&#10;When it is your turn, you have three chances to move the puck aircraft, hit a Tree City and make as many piled up Bird tokens fall from the city. Recover all tokens that match your mission but if you cannot find any, then poachers attack and can damage the aircraft or steal your birds. Whenever you want to, head back to Canopea to definitively bring all recovered birds to safety. Then, start a new trip with a new mission.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the aircraft and the Tree Cities will move on the table and will not come back to their initial position. Distances between cities will grow, increasing the difficulty of moves and missions.&#10;&#10;Canopea is an entirely intergenerational game and its varied mechanical elements allow all players to capitalise on their strengths: memory for the youngest, dexterity for teenagers, strategical thinking for adults. What is more, it is possible to adapt the difficulty to each adventurer within the same game: adults can increase the challenge by only using one or two moves per turn while younger children (from age 4) can simply move the Aircraft without the propeller.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's the time of the year when big Hollywood studios are thirsty for new screenplays that will surely become the next big summer blockbuster. Screenwriters &mdash; often working in teams &mdash; try desperately to get a foot in the door, to land a meeting with a powerful film executive. So many screenwriters are knocking on the door, but big breaks are one-in-a-million.&#10;&#10;Million Dollar Script takes place in a lavish Hollywood office. Through extensive market research, the studio has identified the perfect hero, as well as an equally perfect villain counterpart in order to make them millions. But beyond that, these bigwigs aren't taking any chances; they're going to be following that tried-and-true structure of nearly every record-breaking blockbuster of the past forty years. This film will be one of the greats like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, The Avengers, and Titanic.&#10;&#10;Two writing teams have been invited to pitch their finest most preeminent ideas to a studio executive, a.k.a. &quot;the Exec&quot;. During the meeting, both teams are working on the same movie, pitching their ideas for each of the five traditional story events. Each round the Exec picks the pitch they prefer, which then becomes part of the shared storyline. The losing pitch gets discarded and treated as if it never existed, much like what should have happened to Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000.&#10;&#10;Each team of screenwriters is trying to nudge its way into the good graces of the Exec by winning the majority of the five rounds and scoring points in order to secure the profitable writing deal for themselves.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player rolls a die, moves her basket that many spaces around the game board in a clockwise direction, then picks up one item (or voucher) from the row that her basket is next to and places it in her basket. If a player's basket lands on the same location as an opponent's basket, then the player can take an item from the opponent instead. If a player picks up a voucher, she can exchange it later for another item on the board, putting the voucher in its place, in addition to taking an item. The first player to circle the board has the option of then moving counter-clockwise to pick up more goods; everyone else is finished once they circle the game board.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then weighs her goods against Aunt Trudel's holdings using the funky cardboard scale included in the box. If your goods weight more than Trudel's, you're out; if not, then you're still in the game. Of those players, whoever has the heaviest goods wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the box.&#10;&#10;Fleet Admiral is a card game about becoming a fleet admiral.  Take your intrepid crew on missions, earn prestige, upgrade your ship.  Solve a galactic crisis.  And do it all faster than your opponents, because they want to be in charge too.&#10;End of box&#10;&#10;You are in command of a space vessel from one of the major powers of the Portable Galactic Empire (Human, Brerasan, Hragsh or Jasl-Riin). You want to become the fleet admiral.&#10;&#10;You begin the game with a frigate from your race with a power/up grade cost of 1.  One level 1 crew member (orange shirt AKA (also known as) Operations, or a green shirt AKA Marine, or a blue shirt AKA Command) think Star Trek shirts with the colors changed.&#10;&#10;You also draw one level 1 Component card.  there are four types (weapons, power, sensors and defence). Each of these card types has three specialty sub groups in their category.  When you add these cards to your ship you put them under your player board (ship), similar to Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;There are two decks of cards (component and crew).  On your turn you go on a &quot;mission&quot;.  An 8 sided die is rolled. Four symbols on the die match the crew deck, 4 match the component deck, 1 thumbs up and 1 explosion. If you roll a symbol with one of the two deck symbols you draw one card from that deck.  On the upper portion of the card there will be one or two symbols.  If you don't have Crew or Components that match the symbol or symbols the mission is failed. If you can match the first card you must roll again and draw another card. Now you must be able to match up evenly with what is on the cards to what is on your ship.  Lets say the first card required a missile.  This is a subset of the weapon card.  So if you have a weapon card on your ship it must also be specific to the missile to pass phase one of this mission.  The second card drawn required an orange shirt.  Lets say you only have a green shirt assigned to the security section of your ship.  No worries. As captain you count as one crewman of any shirt color.  You have passed the second part of the mission. You could push your luck and roll the die again for a third part of the mission, but if you fail the requirement of the third card the entire mission fails.  So you stop at two.  You may now attach these cards to your ship if you wish. The first card was a crewman. You assign his orange shirt self to your medical station. The second card was Defenses, sub-set shields. You put it on your ship.  These cards now help you win future missions.&#10;&#10;If you roll the thumbs up symbol you pick a card from either deck and auto pass that stage no matter what.  If it is the explosion the whole mission is failed, no matter what.  There are a few more rules in this area but that's the bulk.&#10;&#10;As missions progress you can use cards earned from winning missions to upgrade your ship.  Bigger ship equals more crew that can be attached and more powerful weapons.  When you upgrade to a battleship a crisis starts to perk.  This is abstract.  At the beginning of a players turn (battleship or higher in possession) a crisis chit is placed in a pool on the table.  Once that pool grows to double the amount of players a crisis has begun.  If the pool grows beyond four times the players at the table everyone loses the game.  You knock the chits down on your turn by taking cards you have won during the mission and instead of adding them to your ship you discard them. Each won card discarded removes a chit.&#10;&#10;There is some coop stuff possible on missions and if you beat the crisis you add up the point totals on your ship cards to determine the winner or &quot;fleet admiral&quot;.&#10;&#10;A light game that could be used as a filler or just with beer and pretzels.&#10;&#10;A little tongue in cheek ship captain card play fun that takes about half an hour.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "extrapolated from session report:&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the legendary necklace of Saba, which went to the grave with its owner upon her death. Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.&#10;&#10;The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.&#10;&#10;Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  &#10;Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.&#10;&#10;The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. &#10;&#10;&#10;Once the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the necklace is completed. The player with the most money is victorious.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The goal is to be the first player to score 100 points.  On each turn, a player gets three rolls to make as many points as possible.  After the first roll the player must hold at least four dice. At the end of the second rolle the player must have at least six dice held. You score points by rolling the same number on your dice.  If you roll a pair of 2s, you get two points.  If you roll a pair of 6s, you get six points. For each additional die with the same number you score that number again. So, for three 6s you score twelve, six for the pair of 6s and six for the additional 6. Four 6s would score 18 and so on. There are also bonuses for all evens or odds, six or more dice of the same number or in sequence.&#10;&#10;What makes the game unique is that it uses four different types of dice, each with a different highest number. For example, the game has two 10 sided dice and their highest number is 10. They are the only dice that can make a pair of ten. All dice have the numbers 1-4 on them, so it is much easier to get lower numbers.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have to use strategy to determine which dice they&rsquo;ve rolled are the best to keep and the best to re-roll.  Do you chance it and try to roll another 8, or play it safe and hold a pair of 4s?  Figuring out the right move in a game with countless possibilities will keep you thinking, laughing and cheering for hours on end.&#10;&#10;",

Players work together to survive the Orc realm of Hirntodia. To win, a Player must 'lie, cheat and steal' to negotiate favorable cards (magic, treasure, victory) and gain the highest Prestige value in trading cards by trading away negative cards (Traps, Monsters and more).&#10;&#10;However, because you are a band, you can't out right kill your competition. If an Orc player dies, the game ends and everyone loses!

    "Description": "Since Pinocchio has come to the Carpenter's house, the Carpenter is no longer lonely. However, because naughty Pinocchio lies too often, he gradually fails to distinguish between true and false. Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a 'real' boy.&quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?&#10;&#10;Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.&#10;&#10;Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio's nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &quot;Angel Token&quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.&#10;&#10;In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn't true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose. Therefore, the storyteller should do her best to make the story confusing.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, a lot of the cards make you draw more cards, and a lot of them require that you have a Brain.&#10;&#10;Dead Money is a quick-playing and clever variation on a classic Cheapass game, and it features glorious cowboy zombies by artist Brian Snoddy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Red Code instructions.&#10;&#10;1.0.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Red Code, a board game where you take control of a WWII military ship. Re-live epic battles with your family and friends. Manage your crew to carry out manoeuvres with your ship, attack the other players&rsquo; ships and co-operate with players in your faction to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;1.1. Characteristics:&#10;The players play 1 on 1, or combine into 2 factions of 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3. The game takes about 45 minutes and is for players over 8 years old.&#10;&#10;1.2. Prologue:&#10;The game combines simple mechanics, the placement of crew, to choose different manoeuvres. Take advantage of the possibilities offered by the terrain and your boat to sink the enemy.&#10;&#10;2.0. Objective of the game:&#10;&#10;2.1. Arena mode&#10;&#10;The first group to sink the enemy ships is the winner. You don&rsquo;t use the score card for this mode, as the sinking of all the enemy&rsquo;s ships implies that the enemy player has been eliminated.&#10;&#10;(Games of 2 vs 2) The first side to lose a ship receives 2 order cards. There is no effect for ships sunk after that.&#10;&#10;(Games of 3 vs 3) The first side to lost 2 ships receives 2 order cards between the players of that side. In other words the first team to be reduced to just 1 ship will receive 2 order cards. There is no effect when other teams are reduced to 1 ship later.&#10;&#10;2.2. War mode&#10;&#10;The first side to get 5 victory points is the winner. Sinking an enemy ship earns you 1 victory point. This is shown by advancing your score token on the score card by 1 position.&#10;&#10;When a ship is sunk, it is returned to the beginning map card and flipped over to show that it will miss the next turn. When the ship is restored after being sunk, it is fully restored (crew, repairs and breakdowns) and you can choose any one of the available spaces on the beginning card to place it in.&#10;&#10;A player who sinks a ship receives an order card.&#10;&#10;3.0. Contents:&#10;&#10;15 map cards&#10;30 order cards&#10;3 blue control cards&#10;3 red control cards&#10;1 scorecard&#10;18 red cubes&#10;18 yellow cube&#10;36 white cubes&#10;6 ship pieces&#10;2 score tokens&#10;&#10;3.1. Map cards:&#10;&#10;The map cards are divided into 4 boxes, which each count as one space for movement. Only 1 ship can occupy a box.&#10;&#10;Islands: These are impassable, so ships can not move over them, and they block line-of-sight for firing.&#10;&#10;Running water: When a ship enters this box, it automatically receives +1 movement which must be used to move to a neighbouring box. If that neighbouring box also has running water, the ship gains another +1 movement, and so on.&#10;&#10;3.2. Control cards&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of ship in Red Code: Submarine; Destroyer; Aircraft carrier. These have some similar manoeuvres, but also some manoeuvres which are unique to that kind.&#10;&#10;On the control card, yellow cubes (repairs) and red cubes (breakdowns) are used to show the state of the ship. Once both of these characteristics have been reduced to 0, the ship is sunk. During the game, any damage taken by the ship reduces the amount of repairs. When the number of repairs hits 0, remove a breakdown token and put 3 repair tokens back on the control card (1 breakdown = 3 repairs). You are not allowed to exceed the amount of breakdown and repair spaces available on the control card.&#10;&#10;Another area of the control card shows what your crew (white cubes) are doing, and this is used to manage the different manoeuvres. At the start, all ships have 6 crew, placed on the crew area on the control card. The control cards each have 4 common manoeuvre boxes and 4 unique manoeuvre boxes.&#10;&#10;Crew: These are used to pay the cost of your ship&rsquo;s manoeuvres. You use up your crew during the battle, but also recover crew each turn during the battle. [Representing the energy of your crew, rather than individual crew members] The crew are the engine of this game, and so good management of your crew is what makes your ship more lethal.&#10;&#10;Manoeuvres: You must choose appropriate attack or defence actions at particular points to manage your ship effectively. Manoeuvres with a crew member already on the square can not be used during that turn.&#10;&#10;&bull;    Movement: Move one square. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Repair: Regain 1 repair cube.&#10;    &bull;    Torpedo: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Orders: Draw one order card. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Immersion: Move two squares. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Countermeasure: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum of 2 spaces, and you regain 1 repair cube.&#10;    &bull;    Heavy torpedo: Does 2 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Floating mine: Does 2 repair damage plus 1 crew damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.&#10;    &bull;    Missile: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Depth charge: Does 2 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.&#10;    &bull;    Shield: Cancels the current manoeuvre, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Assault: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.&#10;    &bull;    Air support: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Radio support: Regain 1 repair cube at a maximum distance of 2 spaces. Can not be responded to.&#10;    &bull;    Medical equipment: Regain 1 breakdown cube, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces.&#10;    &bull;    Radar: Does 1 repair damage plus 1 crew damage at a maximum distances of 3 spaces. Can not be responded to.&#10;&#10;Available manoeuvres: Manoeuvres that do not have any crew on their squares are available to be used. The players can only use these manoeuvres on their turn and can only use the manoeuvres on their ship, except for the response manoeuvres. Manoeuvres that can be used as responses are marked in yellow on the control card and can be used both on your turn and the other players&rsquo; turns. Note that the manoeuvre selected must be available to use - it must not have any crew on it. And responses can only be made when the player whose turn it is has executed a manoeuvre that allows responses.&#10;&#10;For example: The counter measure manoeuvre has a distance of two, and can repair 1 damage and do 1 damage.&#10;&#10;Visual field: This shows what your ship can see and where it can carry out actions. It includes the boxes in a straight line horizontally, vertically and diagonally from your ship and depends on the distance that the specific manoeuvre you want to use has. For example: If an manoeuvre has no distance, you can only carry it out on yourself, but if a manoeuvre has a distance of 2, then it can be used on any ship that distance or less (horizontally, vertically or diagonally only) including your own ship. [In the example picture, the red destroyer can target the blue submarine but can not target the blue destroyer.]&#10;&#10;Note that the enemy ships have the same effect as islands in blocking your line of sight.&#10;&#10;3.3. Order cards.&#10;&#10;These provide certain advantages in the game, providing bonuses, hurting the enemy or modifying the characteristics of the ship (movement, repairs, manoeuvres, etc.). Only 1 order card can be used per turn, but the effects can be used on any target on the table, regardless of distance or objects blocking line of sight. In other words, order cards are not affected by the visual field. In addition, order cards will always be executed and offer no chance for the enemy to respond. Each player may not have more than 3 order cards in their hand at any time.&#10;&#10;&bull;    Ambush: The target ship loses 2 repair.&#10;    &bull;    Deserter: The target ship loses 1 crew from the reserve. This crew member can be recovered in the crew recovery phase.&#10;    &bull;    Boatswain: The target ship recovers 2 crew.&#10;    &bull;    Atomic bomb: 2 repair damage to all ships in a 2 by 2 square (4 spaces in total).&#10;    &bull;    Evasion: The target ship gains +3 movement.&#10;    &bull;    Captain: 1 repair damage to the target ship, and then you draw 1 order card.&#10;    &bull;    Mechanic: The target ship gains 2 repair.&#10;    &bull;    Intercept: 1 repair damage to the target ship, and can not carry out any manoeuvres until their next turn. This means that the target ship will not be able to respond to any manoeuvres until its next turn.&#10;    &bull;    Kamikaze: 1 breakdown damage to the target ship (remember, 1 breakdown equals 3 repairs).&#10;&#10;4.0. Beginning of the game&#10;&#10;4.1. Preparation of the table:&#10;&#10;Shuffle the map cards and place face up a 3 by 4 formation (see example picture). The 3 cards left over are not used in the game.&#10;&#10;4.2. Preparation of the ships:&#10;&#10;The players are divided 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3, depending on the number of players. Next, each player selects a ship from the 3 available, and also takes the corresponding control card. Each player fills up that control card with the red and yellow cubes (repairs and breakdowns) indicated on the control card, plus 6 crew members.&#10;&#10;The two teams have a starting card in opposite corners of the board, and the team members put their ships into one of the 4 squares in their starting card.&#10;&#10;4.3. Start the game.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the order cards and deal out one initial order card to each player. Place the remaining deck of order cards in a pile face-down next to the board.&#10;&#10;5.0. Turn phases&#10;&#10;5.1. Recover crew&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you always replace 2 crew into your reserve, either from the manoeuvre spaces or from the pile of withdrawn crew (see the radar and floating mine manoeuvres and the deserter order card).&#10;&#10;You choose where to recover the crew from depending on what manoeuvres are needed for your next turn.&#10;&#10;5.2. Management of manoeuvres&#10;&#10;You use the manoeuvres available to your ship to try to sink the enemy. The manoeuvres cost crew to carry out the action (according to the number of boxes for that manoeuvre), but also depend on the line of vision of the ship. The target must be within the action&rsquo;s range and on a straight line either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.&#10;&#10;5.3. Possible responses:&#10;&#10;Responses are manoeuvres but can be used in your turn or the turn of another player. For example: Immersion can not be used as a response, but torpedo can be used as a response. The last manoeuvre declared is the first to be carried out. For example, if a player launches an action in front of an enemy and they launch a response which the initial player then responds too, then the response of the first player is completed, then the response of the opponent, and finally the initial manoeuvre. If in the middle of this chain of events a ship is sunk, further manoeuvres in the chain targeting that ship will be wasted but the manoeuvres will still be treated as spent, which means that the crew spent on the manoeuvres will remain spent and the manoeuvres will be unavailable.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Super All Green was originally published in 2014 for 2-4 players, and a second edition was issued in 2015 as ALL GREEN for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;ALL GREEN is a card game that simplifies the rules and play of Japanese Mahjong by reducing the types of cards and scoring hands. This edition is very portable, with two decks of small sized cards. One deck is the Tenbo cards, showing scoring points in values of 10P, 5P and 1P. The other deck is only the green bamboo suite (Ryuiso), hence the game being called all Green. The other Mahjong suites and tiles, such as Dragons, are not represented.&#10;&#10;As in Mahjong, players repeatedly draw a card from the deck and discard one from their hand, trying to build a scoring combination from the five cards they hold after drawing. The combinations in All Green are simply a pair (the Head), and either a Run (Shuntsu) or a Meld.&#10;&#10;Based upon the value of the winning hand, players discard their points cards accordingly. The first player to get down to zero wins, or the player with the fewest points after two rounds.&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;&#10;From the Tenbo points deck, players get a 10P, two 5P, and five 1P cards, giving a total of 25 points.&#10;&#10;Then, after shuffling the bamboo deck well, players are dealt four hand cards each. The remainder are placed face down as a draw deck. Play goes clockwise, with each player taking turns to draw one card from the deck, and discard one card from their hand.&#10;&#10;Once a player has a Pair and a Run or a Meld, they call and score. Then they discard Tenbo cards for the score. Players reshuffle the bamboo deck and play another round, until one players gets to zero points. More usually, play continues until everyone has lead twice, at which point the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#227;&#130;&#189;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#186;&#187;&#233;&#155;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;5&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#143;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#230;&#152;&#147;&#231;&#137;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#186;&#187;&#233;&#155;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;25&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;2&#229;&#145;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;0&#230;&#156;&#170;&#230;&#186;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;ALL GREEN is a simplified Mahjong card game. Unlike Mahjong which has 34 types of tiles, this game only has nine types of bamboo cards and green dragon cards.&#10;&#10;Each round, players are dealt four cards each. They take turns drawing one card and discarding one card until someone completes a winning hand of one pair and a set of three cards (in sequence or of a kind). The winner gains points from opponents according to the difficulty of the winning hand.&#10;&#10;Players initially have 25 points. A game consists of rounds equal to twice the number of players, but may immediately end when a player has negative points.&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Then every turn each player will simultaneous pass a card to the person on the left.&#10;&#10;When someone has a complete set in his hands, he gives a not too obvious signal for example constantly blinking an eye or shaking his head. (From that point on the player with the complete set must pass on the card he receives in the same turn to the left in order to keep his set complete.) All the players have to copy the secret symbol. The last person to react looses the round and receives a letter.&#10;&#10;The first time you loose a round you get the letter E, the second time a Z, the the third time another E and the fourth time a L. You are the EZEL (donkey) and you loose the game.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played as a drinking game where the loser of a round has to drink.&#10;&#10;",

Give each player a scoring disc showing ten droplets.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls the die; based on the die roll the player either chooses a colored droplet in the color of her choice from the pond and places it on her scoring disc or drops a wooden &quot;pebble&quot; into the pond two or three times. After dropping the pebble, she then keeps any droplets that match empty spaces on her scoring disc while returning any other droplets to the pond. The first player to fill her scoring disc wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hungry little demons have invaded your neighborhood! They're up to their usual mischief, and it doesn't look like they'll stop until they're fed. The only way to protect your belongings and get them out of your house is to cook them a meal of their choosing. Head into the Shifting Forest to gather the ingredients you need for your culinary countermeasure, but be careful&mdash;the forest has a mind of its own.&#10;&#10;Hungry Little Demons is a competitive memory game for 2-6 players where you play as both the hero and the villain. You&rsquo;ll move your chef through the ever-changing layout of the Shifting Forest to look for and gather ingredients for your recipes, collect Demon Bait to protect your furniture, and even meet with some of the helpful Wood Sprites who call the Shifting Forest home. At the same time, you&rsquo;ll command your demon to destroy furniture, make mischief, and generally just be a nuisance until it&rsquo;s been fed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player completes at least one of their recipes and gets their chef back to their house. Points are then scored based on recipes completed, ingredients gathered, furniture destroyed, and demons remaining in your chef&rsquo;s house. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",
