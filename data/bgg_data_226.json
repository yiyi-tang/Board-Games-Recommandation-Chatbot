We especially like that it does not take up a lot of room on the table, so it makes a perfect coffee date companion.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 8 full colour hexagon tiles, 6 dice, 4 blue player markers, 4 gold player markers, an instruction booklet (with a thank you page for backers!) and a beautifully presented box that it sure to catch the eye.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to get all four of their player markers into the center tile.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice, and use the dice to perform 1 of 3 actions.&#10;&#10;The actions include placing a player marker on the board, moving a player marker, and attacking an opponents player marker.&#10;&#10;While the mechanics are fairly simple, it still allows for several strategic choices throughout the game, but not so many that you end up with decision paralysis.&#10;&#10;The game runs between 15-20 minutes each and is suitable for ages 8 and older.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players in Crowns want to gain as many crowns as they can, and they do so by rolling dice, then covering spaces on their grids based on what they roll and how they manipulate what they roll.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player starts with 18 tokens and a player board that shows a 5x5 grid surrounded by a border on two sides that effectively makes a larger 6x6 grid. Next to the left column of the grid are die faces 1-6 from bottom to top, and above the top row are the numbers 1-6 from left to right.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls the half-dozen six-sided dice once. If she wishes, she can change any die face to a lower number as long as that number is one that she rolled. If she wishes, she then places tokens on the grid to match the die combinations rolled. For example, if she rolls 5-4-4-3-3-2, she could change all the dice to 2, then cover the six 2s space on her grid; she could also change the 5 to a 4 and the 3s to 2s, then cover the three 4s space and the three 2s space. A player doesn't have to place tokens on her turn.&#10;&#10;Once someone places her 18th token on her grid, the game ends after everyone has had the same number of turns, then players score points. Each token in the outer border is worth 1-6 crowns, depending on where it's located; each token in the inner grid is worth points only if it's part of a complete row of five tokens, and you score points (3-20, depending on the row) only for those completed rows, not for each covered space in the grid. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Avoid the hungry hydra to win a place among the stars!&#10;&#10;In Greece Lightning, you race around a circular track, trying to be the first to complete two laps. On a turn, you roll two dice to move your boat: a navigation die (1-3) and a movement die (1-6). You can roll a second movement die to try to go farther, but if the roll is lower than your first movement die, you bust and keep only your navigation die.&#10;&#10;The circular track is comprised of twelve wedges, with the wedges being randomized each game. In general, the track consists of four paths orbiting the central hydra, but these paths criss-cross a lot, with movement dots and bonus icons at various spots on the movement paths. When you move, you must move clockwise a number of spaces equal to the sum of your dice, but you often have freedom to weave from one path to another. Here are the icons you might encounter:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fish: Collect one fish. You can have up to three fish on hand, and you can spend a fish to re-roll your navigation die or second movement die. You might also need fish to navigate whirlpools.&#10;    Favor of the Gods: Draw a favor card, and place it face down before you. At the end of your turn, reveal the card and use it immediately, save it for later, or give it away, depending on what card it is.&#10;    Track wedges: Collect one wedge and place it face up before you. At the start of your next turn, after determining your total movement, place the wedge on the game board (but not on the starting tile or a player's ship). Use these to make your path easier or to place a hydra directly in your opponents' way.&#10;    Whirlpool: When you land on a whirlpool, you often have multiple exit paths from it &mdash; but you might need to pay fish or have a die with a certain number in order to take a particular path.&#10;    Hydra: Spend a fish when you land on a hydra space or else your movement will vanish for the rest of the turn as you must fight it off.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you land on or cross the starting line, thereby finishing one lap, you receive a fish, a wedge, and a Favor of the Gods card. When someone has completed their second lap, you finish the round to ensure everyone has the same number of turns, then whoever has gone the farthest wins.&#10;&#10;",

Bragg's Army of the Tennessee, after the Confederate withdrawal from Chattanooga. Bragg's actual intention was to stand and fight. In fact, this time &mdash; indeed, for the first time &mdash; his army, heavily reinforced, actually outnumbered his pursuers. As the dispersed Federals deployed along the Chickamauga River, large numbers of Confederates assembled to strike the counter-blow. The Battle of Chickamauga would be the Confederates' last opportunity to annihilate an entire Union Army.&#10;     &#10;Chickamauga utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War. The combat system is intuitive, including all of the details that characterized battle during the Civil War while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure a line of retreat.&#10;&#10;In Chickamauga a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of the rifled musket. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a pirate captain, it's hard to steal booty &mdash; but it is even harder to share that booty equally. If you can outsmart your fellow pirates by using your brains and trading skills, you'll probably end up with the most valuable loot!&#10;&#10;Stingy is an interactive booty-swapping game for 2-6 players, with the booty in question being rum, parrots, coins, diamonds, and pirate flags; these first four items come in four colors, with 3-6 tiles of each item in those colors, while the pirate flags come only in black (as you might expect).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with six randomly drawn tiles, with the remainder of the tiles being scattered face down on the table or placed in the included pouch. On a turn, you swap tiles with a fellow player, then draw 1-2 tiles and add them to your collection. When you swap, you choose an opponent, then take all the tiles of one group (matching symbol &amp; matching color) and add it to your collection. Each group has a value, with the values mostly being pyramidal (1 tile = 1, 2 tiles = 3, 3 tiles = 6, etc.). In return, this opponent then takes one or more groups from you that sum at most the same value as what you stole. If it's impossible to take groups this way, that opponent can take groups that sum to a lower value or demand that you hand over groups that sum to a higher value, with you choosing which groups you give up.&#10;&#10;When you collect all the tiles in a group (e.g., four blue parrots), you place those tiles face down to the side. No one can take these tiles from you.&#10;&#10;After the last tile is drawn, each player takes one final turn, then players score points &mdash; but only for the complete groups that they've collected. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Stingy includes two-player rules that introduce a ghost pirate with whom players can trade, a variant in which players also score points for the number of differently colored groups they collect, and a &quot;Captain Sly&quot; variant in which an opponent who can't take tiles worth at most what you took gets nothing. Good luck trying to make those unfair trades!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This near-future what-if is set at 20 miles per hex, with divisions and brigades as the units of maneuver. It covers the first month of the war that could result if Putin decides to abandon the &quot;opaque war&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;gray war&quot;) approach and go for it big time.&#10;&#10;The idea being to take advantage of the West's (particularly the &quot;old NATO&quot; countries') distraction with the jihad to try to win back all or some of the &quot;Near Abroad&quot; on Russia's European flank.&#10;&#10;Before you ask: the difference between this game and &quot;Putin's War,&quot; which will be appearing in an upcoming issue of Modern War, is that &quot;Putin's War&quot; is a strategic (army-corps at 55 miles (90km) per hex) treatment with operational undertones, whereas the present game &quot;Putin Strikes&quot; is an operational-level treatment with strategic overtones.&#10;&#10;The system will be a further-evolved version of the one I used in NNN2, but better adapted to modern real-world military circumstances. In particular, I'm crafting the combat sub-system to emphasize the growing debate on the appropriateness of the &quot;brigading of everything.&quot;&#10;&#10;The growing complaints are that brigades, BCTs, etc., are too small and weak to last long in an eyeball-to-eyeball First World conventional war, while also being too big to be nimble enough to properly prosecute an urban counterinsurgency war.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game, both players must agree on the number of hexagonal tiles that will form the &ldquo;land&rdquo; to be conquered. Beginners can start playing with few hexagons, while experienced players can use the complete set of 36 tiles. The dimension of the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; determines also the number of dice used by the players. In this game, dice are used as a sort of &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; who will &ldquo;fight&rdquo; to conquer &ldquo;Diceland&rdquo;, although the game is definitely not a war game. Rules are very simple, and although the players have to roll a lot of dice during the game, only a good strategy can lead to a winning position. DICELAND can be played at different levels: the basic one will take only few minutes to be completed, while the most advanced can offer up to 45 minutes of entertainment, introducing the special terrain rules. The rulebook comes in 5 languages, full of pictures and with many game variants.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "By the beginning of 1954, both the French and Viet Minh realized that the war in Indochina was nearing an end. Ho Chi Minh had requested cease fire negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and the French government was looking for a way out that would give them peace with honor. Both sides felt that a &quot;big win&quot; on the battlefield would finally secure at the peace table what they had been unable to obtain in six and a half years of war.&#10;&#10;The site of this battle would be near a village called, in Vietnamese, &quot;Seat of the Border County Prefecture&quot; located in a distant valley of north western Vietnam near the Laotian border. The French high command, under General Henri Navarre, reasoned that such a remote location could not be successfully attacked. General Vo Nguyen Giap thought the position was nearly impossible to defend. The siege of Dien Bien Phu would be the result.&#10;&#10;La vall&eacute;e de la mort (&quot;Death Valley&quot;) is a simulation of this epic siege that ended the French colonial presence in Asia and marked the beginning of a 21 year struggle for national unification. The game is designed for 2 players, one taking the role of the French commander of the fortress complex at Dien Bien Phu, the other of General Giap, commanding the Viet Minh forces laying siege. The game and scenarios are small enough to be played solitaire, however.&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game represents one week. Each assault impulse represents one day. A point of combat strength represents 150 to 200 men, 6 aircraft, 5 or 6 guns, or a single tank. An inch on the map corresponds to 700 yards.&#10;&#10;",

All cards are shuffled together at the start of the game, so the Circles are not laid out to begin as they are in later editions.  The board is formed throughout the game by placing Rail and Circle cards.&#10;&#10;Another big difference is the fact that Circle cards have no special powers in first edition.  Special game effects are only available to players fortunate enough to draw the Damnation cards.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     80 cards, Bridge-size (rectangular), full-color fronts, black &amp; white backs, many miscut&#10;     4 engine tokens, cold-cast resin (poorly cast, as no vacuum table was used), unpainted (so all are white, distinguishable only by shape... spider, serpent, demon, and skull)&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    HellRail: Second Perdition&#10;    HellRail: Third Perdition&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Solstice approaches. A swirling darkness coalesces in the night sky over a field as you, one of five Witches, perform incantations to vie for Earthly prominence, calling upon five Goddesses for protection and favor... But which of your fellow Witches serve the light, and which the dark? Gather information and form alliances, cast hexes, and use all your wit and connivance to ensure your dominance. Serve your Goddesses well, and they will reward you above their other followers, as they cast down those who dare to oppose them.&#10;&#10;Coven is a game of secret alignments for 3-5 players in which each player represents a Witch serving either the darkness or the light. Not only is your starting alignment a secret, but each of the five non-player Goddesses has an unknown alignment as well. Deducing which Goddess(es) and which other player(s) share your alignment will make your strategy clear and victory easier to achieve, but not guaranteed by any means. Gameplay is deceptively simple, with five possible actions as players traverse a circular board with an inner pentagram rotating widdershins changing tactics with each rotation. Coven presents an interesting strategic challenge: the side (Light or Dark) that scores the most Balance defeats the opposing side &mdash; but on the dominating side, only the Witch that scores the most Power can win, so players must be careful not to invest too much in one while neglecting the other.&#10;&#10;Coven includes five playable characters (along with their miniatures) &ndash; Witches of Earth, Water, Spirit, Air and Fire. The game also includes a Goddess Power/Balance board, Black and White magic crystals, hidden alignment tokens, &quot;reversal&quot; alignment crosses (for players who dare to change sides), Artifact Cards and Balance cards,  a Goddess Board,  and a two piece circular playing board with a rotating pentagram.&#10;&#10;",

This two-player game may or may not be a trick-taking game, and is, in a sense, intended to live on the edge.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a deck of cards (numbered 1-21) and two optional scoring cards. To set up a round, shuffle the cards, remove five from play, then deal each player eight cards. The starting player plays any card, then the next player either plays a card at most three higher than the previous card &mdash; so on a play of 5, the next player could play 6, 7, or 8 &mdash; or passes. When a player passes, the previous player collects the played cards, stacks them as a scored trick, then leads a card. When a player is out of cards, you resolve the current trick, then the player who has collected more tricks wins the round; in case of a tie, the player who collected the last trick wins.&#10;&#10;The first player to win three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Power up and scan the battlefield for locations to conceal your highly detailed, movie-based ships. Then, brace yourself for battle as electronic voice commands and sound effects signal your search-and-destroy mission to take out your opponent&rsquo;s ships. Play on your own or battle a friend, and choose from three edge-of-your seat missions!&#10;&#10;Deluxe Battleship Movie Edition has its gameplay based upon Battleship Advance Mission. There are three game modes: Classic game (One attack per turn), Multi-attack game (go again if you hit an enemy ship), Salvo game (make 1 attack for every ship you have in play). Deluxe mission also has two weapon modes: attack with only one coordinate at a time, or use advanced weapons that let you scan for enemies, shoot down enemy plans, or launch missiles for massive attacks.&#10;&#10;Differences from Battleship Movie Edition:&#10;&#10;Has a computer, and adds search jets, and has a 10*14 field. The two player boards are joined in the middle. The ships are smaller and less detailed. Does not come with cards.&#10;&#10;Identical to the Advanced Mission version, with the exception of alien ships, a lighter board, and and an alien voice instead of a female one.&#10;&#10;Green Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission differences from the earlier, blue box edition:&#10;&#10;- improved voices and sounds (earlier said to be hard to understand)&#10;&#10;- the original game play in a bigger, 10 x 14, grid, Salvo mission, and Target Plus One Mission, or Bonus Mission.&#10;&#10;- advanced weapons can now be used in Salvo and Bonus Missions&#10;&#10;- the Attack Squadron planes now move and scan on the same turn, and the planes now scan the space immediately underneath them.&#10;&#10;- the Aircraft Carrier missiles were eliminated. The Attack Squadron planes are equipped with a one-time use only missile that automatically hits every space where it detects an enemy target. It does that on the first target found only, and then it only scans.&#10;&#10;- the Battleship has one Tomahawk missile that hits everything in the 3 x 3 square where it lands.&#10;&#10;- the now-called Light Missile Cruiser has two Harpoon Missiles that covers three vertical or horizontal spaces.&#10;&#10;- the Fast-Attack Sub has two torpedoes that travel from one side to the other of the grid unless it hits a target first. The Sub also has a scanner that will tell you that an enemy ship is in the vicinity but will not tell you the precise location unlike the Attack Squadron Planes.&#10;&#10;- the new design has a raised, inverted-Y design.&#10;&#10;- the ships are redesigned.&#10;&#10;-  there are different colored lights to indicated launches, scans, hits and misses.&#10;&#10;",

If you gain 10 Destiny points you win the game. The other way to win the game is to control of Sunnydale Park (in the centre of the play mats) for six consecutive turns. This means having your characters - and no body else's characters in Sunnydale Park at the end of each of those turns.&#10;&#10;Each player controls 4 spaces in which they can place their locations. Then challenges can be placed in these locations. You can get Destiny points by fighting your opponent(s) or by completing challenges. Destiny points can also help you ascend characters, making them stronger.&#10;&#10;There are also Action cards, Skill cards and Item cards.

The German player is on the offensive, attempting to win the game by rapidly seizing key cities. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires he prosecute counterattacks throughout much of the game.&#10;&#10;Game play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their attack on 22 June 1941, and ends on 7 December of the same year. By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objectives. The game may end sooner than the historic termination time if the German player is able to advance so quickly he causes the overall political, socio-economic and military collapse of the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 20 miles (32 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with Axis-satellite and Soviet corps (and one army) of various types. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout the campaign are built into the movement and combat rules. Each game turn represents one week.&#10;&#10;Players familiar with other strategic-level east front designs will note the unique aspects of LWE lie in its rules governing the treatment of supply, the capture of Moscow, and the Stalin line.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     Rules booklet&#10;     Player Aid cards&#10;     700 Die cut counters&#10;     1 34&quot; x 22&quot; Map&#10;     1 Die&#10;     Storage bags&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Land of Clans is a confrontational pattern building and hand management game, set in the medieval Scottish highlands. All players try to build castles on land they claim, and the game ends when someone has built four of them. Castles of different sizes score differently, and the winner is the player with the highest total score. Often the winner is the player with four castles, but not always.&#10;&#10;The game is played with cards, where each card shows a land symbol matching a space on the board. Further some of the cards show a sword that can be used for attacking castles, some show a shield that can be used for defending the same castles, and some show both a sword and a shield symbol. The players only hold five cards each, so hand management is required.&#10;&#10;The game play can be divided into two parts: the peaceful claiming of land and building of castles, and the aggressive conquering of castles built by the opponents. The claiming is very straightforward: at any point in the game, four separate castle patterns are available. On your turn, play a card from your hand and claim a matching space on the game board. You try to claim spaces that create the available patterns. As soon as one of the patterns is built, the player can place a castle tile over those spaces. By claiming spaces next to an opponent's castle tile, you open the possibility of attacking it for yourself. To attack a castle you also play one or more cards from your hand. But now the only thing that matters is whether the cards you hold show the attacker's sword symbol or not. Play and discard as many sword cards as you want, and hope the defender is not holding enough shields to stop your attack. If the attack is successful, the castle's ownership changes. May the most cunning clan chief win!&#10;&#10;",

The game covers the period from 1 July to 4 July, 1863, when these two armies fought the bloodiest battle in American history to that point. The game system is an adaption fo the popular Napoleon at Waterloo system. Various special and optional rules allow the Players to recreate a picture of an historical event.&quot; (from the rules folder.}&#10;&#10;Cemetery Hill is one of four games included in the Blue &amp; Gray Quadrigame set. The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder. A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.&#10;&#10;Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn. Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control. Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.&#10;&#10;A new concept, &quot;Attack Effectiveness&quot; is introduced in this set of games. Essentially, attacking units that receive an &quot;Attacker Retreat&quot; result in combat are rendered &quot;ineffective&quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day. This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs. This makes &quot;what the heck&quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &quot;ineffective&quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.&#10;&#10;",

This can pe put on the top of any snake by any player before his regular move, but before this, the others have the chance to make a guess about his colour. If they are right, he MUST discover his colour, thus giving the others an advantage, and is not allowed to move the head. If the guess is wrong, he may put the head on the top of a snake or move it on top of another one.&#10;The game ends, when all players pass or if one of the snakes topples down - the score for the player causing this is zero.&#10;Best to be played in several rounds, adding the scores.&#10;&#10;",

Someone rolls all the dice in the center of the table, then players race to be the first to yell out a symbol that is on at least one white and one orange die. If correct, the player collects all the dice showing this symbol; if not, the player collects nothing and sits out the next turn. Once a player has claimed dice, this player rerolls all the remaining dice. If no match can be found, the first player to yell &quot;Nada!&quot; and cover the dice with her hand claims all the remaining dice. Players tally their scores &ndash; one point for each die collected &ndash; then play another round. Whoever has the highest score after three rounds wins!&#10;&#10;Nada! includes variant rules for two other games. In one, the players use all 36 dice at once, playing as above but most likely scoring more points each time since more dice will be in play. The round ends after all dice of one color have been claimed, and the player who collects the most dice wins.&#10;&#10;In the other variant, players start the game by secretly drawing 8, 12 or 16 dice from the bag (with the number based on the number of players). On a turn, each player chooses 2-4 dice from his stock, then all players roll their dice simultaneously, claiming dice as explained above. The players take back any unclaimed dice, then choose 2-4 dice again for the next turn. Once a player has no more dice in hand, the game ends, and the player who has collected the most dice wins.&#10;&#10;",

With colorful Cranium Cubes and fun Flipper Frogs, The Family Fun Game delivers the ultimate family game night!&#10;&#10;Can Mom flip a frog through a hoop you've sculpted out of clay?

Can you work together to write down three of the top five most popular pizza toppings?&#10;&#10;In Cranium Family Fun, everyone will have a chance to shine as you perform wacky stunts, act, sketch, guess, sculpt with Cranium Clay, and more! And the short play time (about 40 minutes) makes it easy to squeeze in some laugh-out-loud family fun before dinner or after school.&#10;&#10;Object: Be the first team to cross the finish line and you win the game!  The teams score points and move on the board by successfully completing their activities.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;1. Divide players into at least two teams. Instruct each team to choose its game piece and place it on the Planet Cranium starting space.&#10;&#10;2 Provide each team with paper and a pencil. Place the four card character boxes out on the board (Creative Cat, Star Performer, Word Worm, Date Head). Place the timer, the die and the Cranium Clay container on the table.&#10;&#10;3 The first team must choose its character box and draw a card. Follow instructions on the card. The player whose birthday is closest is the first player to go on the team.&#10;&#10;4 Roll the die and move the appropriate number of spaces only if your team has completed the character card activity successfully; otherwise, pass the play to the team on the left. Stop on any Planet Cranium spaces you pass over during your move forward. Advance forward to the next Planet Cranium if you roll purple.&#10;&#10;5 Advance to the inner fast track if you successfully complete the task from the Planet Cranium card. Remain on the outer scenic track if you do not complete the task.&#10;&#10;6 Pass the play to the team on the left after you have advanced your playing piece.&#10;&#10;7 Halt the game when a Club Cranium card is drawn. All teams follow the instructions on the card to compete simultaneously against each other in a bonus round. The winning team receives a bonus roll.&#10;&#10;8 The winning team rolls and moves. Continue play with the team whose turn it was before the bonus round.&#10;&#10;9 Enter the Cranium Central at the end of the game board. When you roll, advance to the appropriate character box as indicated by the color rolled on the die.&#10;&#10;10 Complete the activity in Cranium Central. Advance to the next character in clockwise motion. Wait for your next turn to complete that activity.&#10;&#10;11 A team wins when it is the first to complete the four activities in Cranium Central.&#10;&#10;",

Armies of mounted and foot soldiers and fleets of ships contest victory by capturing key places. But even a military victory depends upon control of magic. As magic releases powers of earth, air, water, light, and fire, the wizards grow in strength, volcanoes erupt, storms sweep the mountains and seas, and the creatures of magic join the struggle for both sides. When all five charms are assembled, the completed Pentantastar is a dangerous weapon. If carried to Lug Balor, the East wins, if carried to the Wizard Council, the West wins. Victory depends upon taking advantage of military and magic opportunities, and surviving immediate threats, disasters, and treachery.&#10;&#10;",

New missiles are fired and advance 3 hexes.&#10;&#10;All used action counters are then discarded and cannot be used again in the game.&#10;The &quot;shield&quot; points are won by the players via a missile hit or the explosion of player's mines. Some can be lost also in the case of collisions.&#10;If a player's ship goes off the board because he has no turn or brake left, he's eliminated but still can get points if the mines he had laid out explode.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one who has the most points when only one ship is left on the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Quest for the Antidote (a game by Tom Deschenes and illustrated by Scott Sherman), you and the other players have been poisoned by the mad king! Armed with only your wits and a list of antidote ingredients, you must battle the wilds, monsters, and your fellow players to be the first to return to the apothecary with the items you need.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&bull; 1 Game Board&#10;&bull; 6 Wooden Colored Pawns&#10;&bull; 6 Wooden Colored Breath Trackers&#10;&bull; 6 Sets of 10 Ingredient Cards (60 total)&#10;&bull; 50 Monster Cards&#10;&bull; 18 Meddling Cards&#10;&bull; 10 Loot Cards&#10;&bull; 8 Drop Cards&#10;&bull; 1 10-Sided Battle Die&#10;&bull; 1 6-Sided Movement Die&#10;&bull; 1 Wooden Debris Token&#10;&#10;Preparing the Game:&#10;Each player selects a colored pawn, the corresponding breath-tracker token, and the corresponding deck of ten Ingredient Cards. Players place their pawns on the Apothecary&rsquo;s hut in the center of the board and place their breath-tracker tokens on the number 50 on the breath tracker.&#10;&#10;Next, players shuffle their ten Ingredient Cards and randomly select four ingredients. These will represent the ingredients they will need to collect for their unique antidotes. Players will place their four Ingredient Cards on the table in front of them face-up with the black vial at the top. Each player&rsquo;s remaining six Ingredient Cards can be returned to the box.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt Meddling cards based on the number of players:&#10;&bull; In a game with two players, five Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.&#10;&bull; In a game with three players, four Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.&#10;&bull; In a game with four or more players, three Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.&#10;Meddling Cards are dealt face-down and go into the player&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;Rules &amp; Gameplay:&#10;Health:&#10;Each player starts with 50 &ldquo;breaths.&rdquo; Every time a player rolls the 6-sided movement die or a 10-sided battle die, he/she loses a breath and gets one step closer to expiring. All players&rsquo; breaths are tracked around the edges of the board on the breath tracker grid. If any player is reduced to zero breaths, that player expires and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tip: Select one player at the start of the game to manage the breath tracker.&#10;         Note: Even with bonuses, no player may have more than 50 breaths at any point during the game.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Movement:&#10;Each player will start his/her turn rolling the 6-sided movement die to determine how many spaces to move on the board. That player may choose any path and may move spaces forward and/or backward in any direction, even in the same turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Remember: Each time a player rolls the 6-sided movement die, he/she loses a breath on the breath tracker!&#10;&#10;&#10;Fighting a Monster:&#10;A Monster fight is triggered when a player approaches a Monster Deck and lands on a red space leading to the Monster Deck. However, if a player lands on a red space while traveling away from a Monster Deck, no Monster fight is triggered. In other words, if traveling in the same direction as the red arrow is pointing, you enter combat; if traveling in the opposite direction of the arrow, no combat is triggered.&#10;&#10;When a Monster fight is triggered, a player flips the top card of the Monster Deck and must defeat the revealed Monster before moving on&hellip; or die trying. Players may also retreat and reverse direction if they have any movements left from their movement roll.&#10;&#10;The Monster&rsquo;s level is listed at the top of the Monster Card.&#10;&#10;To defeat the Monster, a player must roll the 10-sided battle die and get a number that is equal to or higher than the Monster&rsquo;s level. The player rolls until the Monster is defeated or until he/she decides to retreat. Once a Monster is defeated, it is put in a discard pile on the table.&#10;&#10;Bonuses &amp; Drops:&#10;Some high-level Monsters, though difficult to beat, may offer helpful bonuses or valuable drop items that can greatly assist a player. Bonuses and drops are listed at the bottom of high-level Monster&rsquo;s cards. Some drops benefit the player for the remainder of the game while others are used once and then discarded.&#10;&#10;Meddling:&#10;Meddling Cards can be used at any point during the game to hinder fellow players from advancing. Meddling Cards can also be traded in at any time to regain five breaths on the breath tracker. Once a Meddling Card is used or traded in, it is discarded from the game.&#10;&#10;Collecting Loot and Ingredients:&#10;To collect an ingredient, a player must land on the corresponding starred green space on the board. Once an ingredient is collected, the player flips his/her corresponding Ingredient Card.&#10;&#10;To collect loot, a player must land on the starred yellow space that abuts it. If a player gets a Loot Card, it is added to his/her hand and may be used at any time. Like drops, Some Loot Cards give players temporary abilities while others award advantages.&#10;&#10;Dueling:&#10;During a player&rsquo;s turn, if he/she ever occupies the same space as another player, then he/she may challenge that player to a duel. A player can only challenge another player to a duel when that other player has an ingredient that the challenger still needs.&#10;&#10;During the duel, each player rolls the 10-sided battle die. Whoever has the highest roll wins, and in case of a tie, the advantage goes to the challenged player. If the challenger wins the duel, he/she takes the needed ingredient item from the challenged player, who now has to either go back and get the ingredient again or give chase to get it back. If the challenged player wins, then the challenger automatically loses 5 breaths and cannot duel that player again this turn.&#10;&#10;Note: Players may use any applicable Drop Cards or Loot Cards during their duels.&#10;Looting:&#10;If a player runs out of breath, his/her pawn is left on the spot of expiration. Each other player may loot the body if they ever occupy the same space as the expired player&rsquo;s pawn. A player may only loot an expired pawn once per turn and only for needed ingredient items or unused or perpetual drop or Loot Cards.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game:&#10;The first player to return to the Apothecary&rsquo;s hut center of the board with all of the necessary ingredients for his/her antidote is victorious! Sometimes, though, all players expire and the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The aim of this game is to find a formula, which consists of 3 parchment sheets, and bring them back to your own castle, where a dragon awaits you. To make being successful in battle against different monsters or other players easier, you need to collect money, equipment and magic rings.&#10;&#10;The game resembles, in part, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (with rings, gold, life points, and the same combat system) but isn't close to being identical. For example, the objective of the two games (beginner's and advanced) is quite different.&#10;&#10;According to traditional adventure style, you have to build up your character to make it stronger. You don't get stronger and get more lives (like in Talisman), but you have to get enough healing potions and rings to manage the combat against monsters and maybe against other human opponents.&#10;&#10;You find different things in treasure chests, which you may search through after beating the monster that guards the place.&#10;&#10;There are additional optional rules with traps, wandering monsters, cooperation and high-risk game (a kind of gambling) when you are entering the inner region. You can choose which one or more of those rules you want to add.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Air King you are an air traffic controller. Your task is to be the first one to guide and land certain aircraft. To make things tricky, however, each player has his own task that's hidden from others, so sometimes it's useful to bluff in order to give false information to other players as to which aircraft are yours.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, all ten aircraft wait next to the ariports in order to depart. Each player receives a task card, which shows four (out of ten) aircraft that you have to guide to the opposing airport. Players keep their task card hidden from opponents. On a turn, a player draws an action card, moves two aircraft (not necessarily those on his task card), and plays up to two action cards; these cards give extra movement to some aircraft or block other aircraft. When all four aircraft on a player's task card are landed, he can reveal his task card on his turn and win the game.&#10;&#10;",
