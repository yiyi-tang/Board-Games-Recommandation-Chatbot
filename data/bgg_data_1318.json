    "Description": "In Test of Faith expansion you will employ hersirs, longships, catapults, and countryside brigands against your foes. You will find mountainous passes on the roads of the land, and churches where you can take refuge.  Each of these five additions provides its own path to accumulating victory points which you can use in concentration or dabble in to supplement your strategy.  At the same time each avenue hinders your rivals in its own fashion.&#10;&#10;NEW TILE - PASS is a hex side terrain feature placed across from an empty side, a road side, a mountain side, or another pass.  An unblocked pass side is transited like a road side.  A pass side gives you a church action with which you may construct a church in a town.&#10;&#10;This expansion also includes SOLO MODE for new terrain tiles and the all-new TEAM vs. TEAM MODE. With these modules, you will be able to play the game alone and create a team with your friend and face the team of your opponents.&#10;&#10;",

You will need to use all of your creativity, your wits and your determination in order to solve the Cards. Are you up for a challenge?&#10;&#10;The puzzles are in the &quot;At Home Mystery&quot;-style, meaning they resemble the kind of thought process used in Escape Rooms - but are solvable at home! Clues are scattered throughout all the seven Cards, and combining those clues will bring you step by step closer to the final answer of each card. To solve them you will have to use all of your puzzle-skills extensively, from out-of-the-box-thinking to deciphering and researching. Every card is its own puzzle, and one card (the Letters Card), is a meta-card. That means that it incorporates the final answers of all the other Cards in its puzzles.&#10;&#10;You should be able to send the Cards by mail, as they conform to most of the international postcard guidelines (including PostNL). The Cards vary greatly in difficulty and general puzzle-style, so there should be one available for every kind of puzzle-fanatic out there. You do not need to damage anything on the Cards in order to solve them, so after you've finished you can just send them on to one of your puzzle-lovin' friends!&#10;&#10;This product contains one printed set of The Cards of Confound, containing all seven Cards and a Users Guide. To help you out during all the puzzling, you can find step-by-step-hints and spoiler-free solution checkers on our website.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The gods are angry! Which gods you may ask? The Mediterranean Sea in ancient times. The Persian Empire, the Greek city states and the mighty Pharaonic Empire of Egypt fought for dominance in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. The people from all of these empires see the gods as their allies and trust them as supporters for their cause!&#10;&#10;The game series &ldquo;History of the Ancient Seas&rdquo; is the ultimate journey through these exciting times. Build new fleets in your city to explore unknown lands, conquer islands and build a great empire.&#10;&#10;DIES IRAE is a three player game. The challenge in a three player game is that gamers face a constant two versus one constellation. All three players have to fight on at least two fronts at the same time and have to keep a close eye on both opponents. The worst case is they are in an armistice which means they could both focus on you. Each player should avoid this situation at all costs. Which god will help their people the most in the struggle of dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean Seas?&#10;&#10;Your goal is to become the leading empire in the known world. To achieve this, you will need to build armies and fleets to increase your military might, expand trade routes, conquer islands and provinces, develop your military skills, economic efficiency and culture, while always keeping an eye on the wealth, happiness and stability of your people.&#10;    &#10;The game is played in highly interactive micro-impulses. The heart of the game system is the action cycle: The players choose one of the eight possible actions. Actions chosen by a player can&rsquo;t be chosen subsequently by the next player. The number of possible actions is limited each turn.&#10;&#10;War or peace: That is your decision! You can expand your empire by leading your people to war! But war is costly and the outcome is uncertain. You can lead your empire to the golden age of civilization by keeping the peace and bringing stability and wealth to your people without following the path of war. Offer terms to aggressive enemies to distract or delay them, but always be prepared to defend your empire.&#10;&#10;You will move your 3D wooden playing pieces (representing fleets and legions) across the beautifully illustrated map from the Hellenistic main land and islands to the shores of Persia in the east and the northern part of the mighty empire of the Pharaons to expand your trade network and increase your trading status.&#10;&#10;",

But hedgehogs are very slow creatures. And the other animals are growing impatient!  So one by one, the animals begin to push the hedgehogs along the forest floor, hoping to finish the race before tea time.&#10;&#10;In this preschool game, each player picks their favorite hedgehog and lines it up at the beginning of the jungle track track.  A shuffled deck of animal cards, as well as the big and small animal disks, wait off to the side, cheering on the racers.  On your turn, flip over the top animal card and find the matching animal disk. Then use that animal to push the hedgehogs further along the track, but only as far as the canopy!  As more and more animals crowd in behind the little hedgehogs, they'll get shoved, pushed, and jostled further and further down the field until one unlikely hedgehog pops out the other end of the racetrack and is declared the winner.  If it's your hedgehog, you win!&#10;&#10;Safari Sprint features all real world plants and animals that can be found in the Greater Rift Valley of Africa.

Sir John is known for being the first into any battle and the last to leave, the most violent of the knights and yet, somehow, the one who has survived the longest. He will attack just about every problem with his sword, dive into battles he has nothing to do with, and come out of it smelling of roses - and blood.&#10;&#10;Sir Beauregard was a young man when this began. Other knights teased him, calling him Beauregard the Pure, Beauregard the Chaste, even the more so when the wenches of the village were particularly accommodating to a pretty-faced young man. He has aged horribly since the zombies first showed up, losing much of his naivete and hope for life. He had to cut his way out of the castle, mowing down zombies that had once been peasants - and village wenches. Now Sir Beauregard's eyes are shadowed, and he has vowed to true purity until the scourge of zombies is ended.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Everyone starts at a predetermined base, then presses the button on their bean and runs off to hide while the Seeker closes their eyes and counts.&#10;&#10;While you try to hide, your bean may be unable to control itself and continuously let out little farts and giggles.

If you make it back safely, you can exchange your bean for its matching score card.&#10;&#10;Once all players have been tagged or returned to base, the round ends and each player earns points based on how well they did that round.  The Seeker earns points for any beans they collected (silent beans are worth more than loud ones).  Seekers earn points for any card they collected (loud bean cards are worth more than silent ones).  Continue playing until each player has had a turn as the Seeker, adding up the points you earn each round, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Now our adventurers will travel the lands and interact with villages, towns and cities, and explore vast wildernesses in search of amazing quests.&#10;&#10;Through the use of a special calendar, the adventurers will set off from their homeland (a home hex), spending days (crossing them off on the calendar) to take actions, and all the while trying to complete quests. They will need to scout the surrounding areas and navigate towards quests they will be finding out about on their travels; however, along the way they will need to find food, rest and may encounter events that could aid, or hinder their efforts.&#10;&#10;The different terrain that they will encounter (such as hills, mountains, forests, deserts, swamps, seas, marshes, tundras, jungles and grasslands) may contain rivers and roads, and these will greatly impact their movement, and make journeys slow until they can afford a mount; perhaps until then, they will try to find a passing wagon, or cart and pay for a lift.&#10;&#10;As time trickles away, the seasons pass by and the adventurer will find certain times of the year more food is found during the warmer months and less during the colder months. Also various terrain events may be harder, or easier to overcome depending on the time of year.&#10;&#10;If the current lands are proving difficult, or when 25 quests have been completed, it may well be time to take a voyage across the seas to a faraway land in search dungeons waiting to plundered. The adventurer pays a ship to take them, and plots a route to another land (hex) sheet. There is no limits to the number of lands that can be explored. In addition, if the adventurer wants to take part in the campaign and adventurer books released for D100 Dungeon, they may also take a voyage to those lands and play those quests too.&#10;&#10;You will need the D100 Dungeon rule book to play the world builder game, and it is fully compatible with everything that has been released for D100 Dungeon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Liber Militum: Encamisada ventures as the first miniature skirmish wargame in the Liber Militum series, set in the days of the pike and the musket.&#10;&#10;Although Liber Militum: Encamisada has as its inspiration from the characteristic skirmishes that arise in the West of Europe, it is perfectly valid for other scenarios of the time. Besides being possible to recreate the endless struggle of Protestants against Catholics in Flanders, we will be able to transport ourselves to the Christian border with the Ottoman Empire, to the Russian steppes or even to the early conquest of America.&#10;&#10;As with Tercios, there is a complete version of the game Liber Militum (forthcoming) and a lighter one, Brevis Editio. The Brevis Editio is fully functional and fully compatible with the other, the rules are the same. Only additional content is added in the Liber Militum: Encamisada&#10;&#10;Factions: In the Liber Militum version it will be possible to choose a Faction for our company. In doing so, the rules of each one will be applied to us, with restrictions and benefits. There are a significant number of Factions, giving us great freedom of customization.&#10;&#10;Campaign: Probably the most attractive addition is the possibility of playing in campaign. Different alternative methods are added to manage it with sample maps.&#10;&#10;Progression: We have a system of evolution by experience for campaigns, with which we can improve our Captain and the Company.&#10;&#10;Scenarios: In the full version we have several extra scenarios: shooting cannons, ambushes or assaults in which civilians participate are some of them.&#10;&#10;Multiplayer: Rules are provided for more than two players, including special scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One team represents &bdquo;Team Stefan&ldquo; and confronts &bdquo;Team Candidates, always one player in each game, and scores points for his team with each game that is won. Players split into two teams of even size, if possible, and alternate to provide the host for each game; a player being host must act completely impartial. By its position the round marker indicates the category of the game that will be played, the individual game will be determined by the spinner. Possible categories are Action &amp; Risk, Chance and Dexterity and Bet &amp; Think. Some examples for possible games: Catch a ball, Flea Circus, Bowling House numbers, Spelling mistakes, Hum a Song, Tongue Twisters, Mirror Writing, Card puffing, Pancake turning or Joke Questions and there are also games like The Bottle or Balloon Ball, for which you must find the material in your household.&#10;&#10;When the game has been determined, both teams choose the candidate for this game and the team that currently is behind as regards to points decides who will start. The host reads out the rules or explains them. At the start of the game you choose the length of the game by choosing the number of individual games. When a team has collected the number of points necessary tow in the selected length - 8 points for Ratzfatz with up to 5 games, 28 points for Medium with up to 10 games and 61 points for Showtime with up to 15 games - the game ends instantly and this team is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;In analogy to the &ldquo;grown-ups&rdquo; game Schlag den Raab Kids, too, is a felicitous mix of new and familiar games offering a good mix of action, movement, knowledge and thinking.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1914 Deluxe is an operational level hex-and-counter wargame that covers the first few months of the First World War when the German Army began its offensive into neighboring France. The German player must decide how best to perform the initial invasion. Should it be a direct assault across the French border, or should the assault follow the &ldquo;Schlieffen Plan&rdquo; of a march through a more lightly defended Belgium? Several factors outside of the players&rsquo; control add challenges, frustration, and a high level of replayability. Will the players be able to define their own invasion plans or will their respective &ldquo;High Commands&rdquo; dictate a pre-determined setup? Will treaties be signed with neighboring states that might impact the availability of additional forces? And what of the looming threat of action on the Eastern Front? All these provide a variable, but accurate simulation of the First World War&rsquo;s opening moves.&#10;&#10;The game includes a huge 34&rdquo; by 44&rdquo; map that covers the western border of France from Belgium and the North Sea to Switzerland in the south at roughly ten miles per hex. Combat units are mostly corps, with a smattering of divisions and brigades, representing infantry, cavalry, and artillery. These pieces represent the forces of not only Germany and France, but also Great Britain, Belgium, The Netherlands, and even a couple of Italians. The terrain depicted on the map is a challenge to navigate, with forces depending upon the use of rail lines to more quickly advance and provide the supply needed to fight.&#10;&#10;The basis for 1914 Deluxe is the original 1914 game published by The Avalon Hill Game Company in March of 1968. The project began as an effort to create an updated version of the original game&rsquo;s ugly &ldquo;painted&rdquo; map that is difficult to decipher in many respects. Once completed, it was not that much of an effort to also create a new, colorful set of counters (including new informational markers) that simplifies play. It was then a short, additional step to rewrite the rules in a manner that incorporates some of the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; rules, some new rules, and known errata to create a new, cohesive rules set of under twelve pages.&#10;&#10;This updated version takes what was originally a difficult game to play, more due to its components than its rules, and provides a relatively simple, exciting, and highly replayable gaming experience. For those who prefer the original game (warts and all), they are welcome to simply use the new map with or without the new counters for a more colorful experience.&#10;&#10;Now, YOU can refight the opening months of the First World War!&#10;&#10;1914 Deluxe: Hell Unleashed is available from War Diary Publications.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Apocalypse Zombie Core Set is a miniature skirmish game set in the zombie apocalypse. The outbreak has spread throughout the world while many people thought it was a hoax. Before the world realized that it was indeed happening it was too late.&#10;&#10;In Apocalypse Zombie you have two ways to play. First is quick battles that allow you to choose a character, select a mission, set up, and play. It is a fast, fun, and bloody intro into the game. The second is the campaign. In campaign mode, you are tasked with performing missions to gather supplies, rescue survivors, upgrade home base and kill boss zombies. Campaigns can last as long as you want. With 14 Missions each with variable set up and more coming the carnage can be long lasting or short and sweet. You can &ldquo;win&rdquo; just by killing the Butcher Zombie and saying you have settled the area enough to prosper. Or you can trudge the blood to new bosses, new buildings, and increase the scope of the world.  You may use either pre- made characters for fast entry into the unforgiving world. Or you can create your own character to level and guide through the world.&#10;&#10;Apocalypse Zombie is played with a player turn followed by the zombie turn. Zombies are pretty much automated - reacting to sight or sound. This allows for all players to be on the same side and fight and die together. Apocalypse Zombie does have options for those more combative players that bring player vs player into the game. Zombie Abilities can hinder or severely damage your attempts to survive. Players have the choice of being sneaky or going in guns blazing. It really depends on your play style.&#10;&#10;Combat is done with rolling attack dice to see if you hit. Defense works the same way. Hit Points are tracked with Heart Tokens.&#10;&#10;Searching is done the same way. Each building has its own search deck in Zombie Apocalypse. So searching the Clinic will give you different results then searching the Cabin.&#10;&#10;So how about those Zombies? Well the first boss, the one that comes in the core set, is the Butcher. He is big ugly and hard to kill. You must face him in the Butcher Shop. Players should not attempt this until they are truly prepared. Along with the Butcher you get 18 Shamblers. Slow, pesky zombies that can put your survivors in a bind. Next you get 6 Brute Zombies. These big boys will ruin your day real quick.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hysteria is a quick, compelling, rules-light social deduction game for 5-9 players. Trying to solve the mystery is about what you think you know and who you think you trust. The Dia de los Muertos theme provides a compelling narrative for gamers of all ages.&#10;&#10;There are two unique gameplay hooks that make Hysteria an exciting game for players of any experience level. First, players may actively switch teams during the game. This allows people who don't like being deceptive a chance to choose a different team. Second, every player has to rely on information that has been filtered through other players' memory and intention. Is someone suspicious or just forgetful?&#10;&#10;Hysteria is played with a small row of cards face down in front of each player. The game has three rounds each played in two separate phases: The Information Phase and the Capture Phase. During the Information Phase, players get new cards, pass cards, and share information honestly or deceptively. During the Capture Phase, players attempt to convince others of what they have seen! The game ends after the third round is complete. Capture the Human cards to win!&#10;&#10;",

Each round players collect ingredient cards that can be combined to create different drink orders. There is a &lsquo;lobby&rsquo; of 8 customers waiting for their order, and each customer card displays the type and number of each ingredient needed to craft their drink. Each customer is worth a given dollar amount based on that customers&rsquo; order, which can vary in complexity and size, and this amount counts towards a player&rsquo;s point total at game end. If a player has the required ingredients to fulfill a customer card on their turn they claim that customer towards their total score!&#10;&#10;In addition to ingredient cards, players have the chance to draw special cards that may help them, or may disrupt the plans of their opponents. The game ends when any player has claimed a total of 10 customers, and the player with the highest customer points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The Subjects from each team lie on the floor, side-by-side, looking up at the slime crane - a device made up of a rotating arm holding a syringe filled with green slime.  The slime slowly begins to ooze from the syringe.  Taking turns, the Interrogators quickly draw a card and read the question aloud to their teammate.  If they answer correctly, the Interrogator gets to move the crane into position over the other team's Subject.

There have been immense opportunities to build trading powers in the rich and fertile regions all over the Mediterranean Sea.  But the moment will come when the greed for more power and wealth can only be stopped by another powerful empire at the frontiers of yours that has ambitions and plans of their own. Players will have to decide to send armies or diplomats to regions far away from their capitol to declare war or keep the peace.&#10;&#10;The game series &ldquo;History of the Ancient Seas&rdquo; is the ultimate journey through these exciting times. Build new fleets in your city to explore unknown lands, conquer islands and build your own great empire.&#10;&#10;In MARE NOSTRUM, the third and final installment in the &ldquo;History of the Ancient Seas&rdquo; game series, you will lead one of the great Empire: The Roman Empire, the Mighty Seafarers of Carthage, the Greek City States, Egypt or Persia.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to become the leading empire in the Mediterranean Sea. To achieve this, you will need to build armies and fleets to increase your military might, expand trade routes, conquer islands and provinces, develop your military skills, economic efficiency and culture, while always keeping an eye on the wealth, happiness and stability of your people.&#10;    &#10;The game is played in highly interactive micro-impulses. The heart of the game system is the action cycle: The players choose one of the eight possible actions. Actions chosen by a player can&rsquo;t be chosen subsequently by the next player. The number of possible actions is limited each turn.&#10;&#10;MARE NOSTRUM is a five player game. New in this chapter of the game series is that each power has unique properties that players must use wisely to achieve advantage over their opponents. &#10;Which god will help their people the most in the struggle of dominance in the Mediterranean Seas?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It&rsquo;s time to hit the arena, Coach! Draft your team and get ready to face-off in one of six different action-packed game modes. Pass the bomb, capture the flag or fight to become king of the hill - but knowing when to unleash your players&rsquo; powerful OverDrive move will be key to coming out on top. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t go down without a fight!&#10;&#10;OverDrive features an exciting drafting mechanic that means you never quite know what Players you&rsquo;ll have on your team each game. Take it in turns to choose the Players you want in your roster to create your dream team before heading into the arena. Advanced drafting rules open up even more tactics as both Coaches vie for their favourites!&#10;&#10;On their turn a Coach activates one of their players and moves them around the arena to try and score or knock out an opponent. Dice rolls are required for tests, like Slams or Dodges.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 8 Rushes (turns) or if one Coach reaches eight points. {layers win the game by reaching eight points or having the highest score at the end of eight Rushes (turns).&#10;&#10;OverDrive features an innovative tug of war scoring system that means the lead can quickly pass between Coaches. A good turn can mean you&rsquo;re suddenly back in the game, while poor tactics can give your opponent the edge.&#10;&#10;",

You do this by picking them up, but first you must distract them by appealing to their mood.&#10;Each turn, all the cats will have their mood swings, and then move, act or react accordingly. Then you can move around, opening and closing doors, moving toys and getting food and water where a cat will see it, and, if you played your odds right, pick up some cats to take them upstairs.&#10;&#10;But they won't stay there forever - if they feel strongly about something, they'll come downstairs again, looking to satisfy their urges. So you need to hurry and put all the rest away quickly.&#10;&#10;As if that wasn't enough, your time is limited: your visitors are arriving soon, and if you don't manage to get all the cats upstairs before the mood cards run out, they'll crash your party the entire night. Good luck getting your guests to enjoy their dinner...!&#10;&#10;",
