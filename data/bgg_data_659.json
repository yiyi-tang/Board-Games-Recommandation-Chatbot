    "Description": "Theme:&#10;In Chinese, Kim-Bac means &quot;the treasure seeker&quot;. A breath-taking treasure race in the narrow streets of an old Chinese town: that's the theme of this new game, fast paced, constantly renewed with an uncut suspense.&#10;&#10;Kim-Bac is played in to phases: in the first one, &quot;where is the treasure hidden?&quot;, all the treasure seekers try to put their hands on the chest that contains the secret of the treasure hideout.&#10;In the second phase: &quot;the treasure race&quot;, a single player, the Kim-Bac, knows where the treasure is hidden. All the others ally to capture him and share out the treasure.&#10;Randomness almost never occurs in this second game phase. Alone against everyone, will the Kim-Bac be able to reach the treasure hideout?&#10;&#10;&#10;Th&egrave;me :&#10;En chinois, Kim-Bac veut dire &quot;le cherche tr&eacute;sor&quot;. Une haletante course au tr&eacute;sor dans les &eacute;troites ruelles d'une vieille ville chinoise : c'est le sujet de ce nouveau jeu au rythme rapide et au suspense ininterrompu, constamment renouvel&eacute;.&#10;&#10;Kim-Bac se joue en deux parties : dans la premi&egrave;re : &quot;o&ugrave; le tr&eacute;sor est-il cach&eacute; ?&quot;, tous les chercheurs de tr&eacute;sor essayent de mettre la main sur le coffre qui contient le secret de la cachette du tr&eacute;sor.&#10;Dans la deuxi&egrave;me partie : &quot;la course au tr&eacute;sor&quot;, un seul joueur, le Kim-Bac, sait &agrave; quel endroit le tr&eacute;sor est cach&eacute;. Tous les autres s'allient entre eux pour le capturer et se partager le tr&eacute;sor.&#10;Le hasard n'intervient presque pas dans cette deuxi&egrave;me partie du jeu. Seul contre tous, le Kim-Bac pourra-t-il parvenir jusqu'&agrave; la cachette du tr&eacute;sor ?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game developed out of a BGG dice design contest game i posted a few months ago (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/552079/my-many-monster-dice-game-competition-win-gg). My solo game rules for the pictured dice (which can be purchased at http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/) is as follows:&#10;&#10;Many Dungeon Dice&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll need the many monster dice, paper to keep track of your character and draw out your dungeon, and a pen.&#10;&#10;Roll the D20 to discover how many monsters you must encounter during your game and mark this value down. You must defeat this number of monsters to win the game without being slain yourself. Any gold and jewels you have left at the end if yours to keep.&#10;&#10;Then, with the five numbered dice, assign one die to each 5 values - monster hit point die, and attack and defense dice.&#10;&#10;Roll the map die, drawing out your dungeon as you go. Be as artistic as you like in this. Stairs and doors always have traps. Each door you roll will enter into a room, and there will always be a unlocked exit door in an adjacent wall. The T corridor branches off into other hallways and you may backtrack your path if you wish during exploration.&#10;&#10;If you roll a door or a stair check first for a trap by rolling the 3 trap dice, if two faces match that trap is sprung.&#10;&#10;Next, if you rolled a door, you enter the room. Roll the colored monster die to see what level of monster you will fight, and roll the corresponding colored monster die to see what you will fight. You always have initiative in an encounter.&#10;&#10;To battle:&#10;&#10;Roll your Battle Strength die and add that value to your Battle Strength for a magical weapon if you possess one. Then roll for the monster. Depending on the color and type of monster they will have different strengths and powers as summarized in the rules.&#10;&#10;Once you have defeated a monster you may roll for treasure using the Treasure Die.&#10;&#10;Explore the dungeon until you defeat/kill all the monsters you are required to. If you do this count yourself lucky you survived with your limbs and sanity intact. Spend your gold at the nearest wenchery or tavern.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Scrabble game features six interchangeable board games. You can play the classic game, or try a version with &quot;blanks&quot; and &quot;blockers.&quot; You can even design your own custom game with the nine mini-boards.  Some of the boards have themes like &quot;outer space&quot; or &quot;in the clouds.&quot;&#10;&#10;Other than the classic game, here are the variations you can try with Scrabble Switch-Up&#10;&#10;Blanks and Blockers: If you play a letter that covers a blank or block square you take the appropriate tile. A blank acts as a normal wild card with the added bonus that it doesn't count as one of your seven. A blocker is a tile you can play immediately to prevent someone else from using a specific square.&#10;&#10;Bustin' Out:  Make words that lead you outside the walled in junkyard. This variation also uses cards - land on a guard dog and draw a card that you can use to mess up another player.&#10;&#10;Hyper-Race: A two player game with the object of making words crossword style that lead from the space station at the top to the earth below. Land on a comet and get a free blank tile. Land on a flying saucer and draw a card similar to the guard dogs above.&#10;&#10;Free for All: Uses a smaller 9X9 grid with the expanded rule that words can now be made diagonally with a limit of three words made per turn.&#10;&#10;Surprise: Allows you to completely change the traditional Scrabble board by mixing up where the premium spots are located plus adds new ones such as wild and quadruple score. You have nine double sided squares that you use to make up the entire board.&#10;&#10;",

Based on the property they land on players can take a lottery ticket, play a casino game such as slots, bet on a horse race, or acquire one of a handful of Keno parlors.  Players compete to gain the most money without going bankrupt.&#10;&#10;In terms of actual game play, there is very little decision making other than the amount of particular bets though even this is fixed for some of the games.  Occasionally players have the option of switching between tracks.  All games are determined by random spins, dice rolls, or draws.  For example, the horse race has six horses starting at the same point and all players bet on a horse; a die is rolled and the corresponding horse advances one space; this continues until one horse has advanced to the finish.  As another example, lottery tickets are simply distributed as one lands on the spot with a random winner drawn later in the game.&#10;&#10;The game board is a thin cardboard, the chips and horses are generic plastic pieces.  Generally the quality is below average even for a mass market game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Box --Made by the makers of Nick the Greek Official Casino Gambling Games&#10;&#10;The most exciting strategy board game about casino gambling ever made!&#10;&#10;Contains: Beautiful casino board game, authentic roulette layout, dice, poker chips, keno parlor ownership cards, roulette/slot machine spinner, six molded race horses, six game tokens, lottery tickets, odds cards, cashier checks, NICK THE GREEK money, plus complete easy-to-follow instructions.&#10;&#10;Great fun for the whole family&#10;For 2 to 6 players&#10;&#10;All the glitter and fast action of a trip to any one of the world's glamorous gambling casinos.&#10;&#10;Get to Play&#10;9 Great Casino Games&#10;Including: Roulette, Blackjack, Poker, Craps, Slot Machine, Horse Race, Chuck-A-Luck, Baccarat, and Keno plus A State Lottery!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A DIY expansion for the Great War at Sea series that assumes the Civil War had turned out differently.&#10;&#10;From the APL website... &quot;When Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston&rsquo;s Army of Mississippi destroyed the Union&rsquo;s Army of the Tennessee at Shiloh in April 1862, it brought despair to a Northern public already restive over the war&rsquo;s course. A few weeks later the entire world saw how a single Confederate ironclad could isolate the Union&rsquo;s Army of the Potomac on the Virginia Peninsula; the Union ship that might have saved the day, the ironclad Monitor, had been swamped in heavy seas and sank before it could arrive on the scene. With no help of reinforcement, resupply or rescue and Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s Army of Northern Virginia launching incessant attacks, George McClellan surrendered his command. The American Civil War was over after roughly a year of fighting.&#10;&#10;Fifty years later, the United States and Confederate States share a divided continent. The South has expanded into the Caribbean Basin and Central America, cutting a canal across Nicaragua and establishing new states and territories. Under pressure from their British and French allies, the Confederate States gradually eliminated slavery, but severe class and racial tensions remain. Northern politicians know talk of re-unification is an easy crowd-pleaser; even the United States Navy continues to name warships for Southern states and cities.&#10;&#10;War in Europe has finally brought the long-simmering American feud into open conflict. The United States, pressured by its German allies, seeks to disrupt trade through the Caribbean Basin and deny these resources to the Allied war effort. The Confederacy, outnumbered and outgunned by its rival, must protect its economic lifelines if it is to survive as an independent state.&#10;&#10;Confederate States Navy is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened, waged by a fleet that never existed. It is not a complete game: Ownership of U.S. Navy Plan Gold is necessary to play most of the 10 scenarios included and Jutland, Pacific Crossroads, Mediterranean, Sea of Troubles and Black Waters to play all of them.&#10;&#10;Confederate States Navy is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&rsquo;s components.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Can they find the key to time travel and stop the disaster before it happens?&#10;Morph - Shape-shifting people seeking to develop their civilization through technology.&#10;Ralyk - Fighting &quot;the madness&quot;, a terminal disease, the Ralyk try to improve their genetic codes and overcome the disease by stealing genes from other species.&#10;Varpor - Fed up with the wars, kidnappings, thieveries and utter violence that has overtaken the galaxy, the Varpor, and their liveship Sunrays take it upon themselves to police the galaxy and restore order.&#10;Wallaboo also make an appearance in the form of a powerful ally.&#10;&#10;Aside from missions, Ethereum adds worlds into play. Trading is introduced as a playing mechanic, and civilizations develop by developing technologies that will help each to fulfill their story. Each world has a unique power, and when the powers collide, the battles are certain to be epic.&#10;&#10;This is, at this time, a print and play game. The rule set, all cards and sheets are provided on this site for your printing and reference.Again, the rules are quite simple, and play should begin perhaps less than 10 minutes after resources have been printed. Though cubes can be purchased for easier game play, scratch paper works as well.&#10;&#10;This is NOT an expansion. This is a completely new game with the same incredible characters. This might be compared to a much easier way of learning a thematic game like Twilight Imperium or Galactic Emperor. And thank you Christian Peterson and Adam West for your incredible contributions toward playing mechanics and story-based game play.&#10;&#10;",

The cards are familiar, as long as you&rsquo;re looking at the fronts, lovingly illustrated by Aaron Williams. But on the back, one or more suits appear, giving you a glimpse into the future.  The better the card, the less information you have about what suit it is.  That ability to look into the future gives the game its shape, and presents some unique challenges for the veteran card player.&#10;&#10;Foresight is also an engaging trick-taking card game, using that special set of cards.  The bidding system is at once familiar, a simple system of bidding how many tricks you are going to take, and different, in that you get to bid multiple times.  As befits a game with as much uncertainty as Foresight features, you get to place several bets, rather than be locked down into one bid.  And once play begins, part of your hand is obscured even from you.  Managing your information and your crucial hole cards is a skill that is unique to playing Foresight, and it&rsquo;s a fresh challenge that card players everywhere can appreciate.&#10;&#10;",

Players construct a modular board and then strategically position their dice to make a capture. When two dice connect, the die with the highest facing side wins.&#10;&#10;SET UP:&#10;&#10;1) The board:&#10;Each player picks two colors of Nestortiles and takes all the tiles of those colors. The rest of the tiles are shuffled face down and patched together into a 6x6 grid. The grid is flipped over, revealing the pattern of pips. This will be used as the game board.&#10;&#10;2) The dice:&#10;Players now use their twelve Nestortiles to assemble two dice in any way they please.&#10;&#10;3) Placing the dice on the board:&#10;Players now place their dice in the corners of their own side of the game board with any side face up, so long as it does not match the number of the tile the die is on. Who ever is start player should place his or her dice first, giving the second player a chance to evaluate the position and place his or her dice accordingly.&#10;&#10;Example: In one of Eva's corners, there is a tile with four pips. She may place either of her dice in this corner, so long as it is not showing 4 pips on its top face. Once she places both of her dice, it will be Nestor's turn to place his. Then Eva will make the first move.&#10;&#10;Players may decide turn order in any manner they like. Start player will alternate each round.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:&#10;The first player to &quot;capture&quot; one of the other player's dice wins the round. First player to win 3 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;1) Moving dice:&#10;When players take their turns, they move one of their dice three times. Moving a die means &quot;tilting&quot; it on to the next space forward, backward, left, or right, so that the top face of the die becomes the side facing that direction.&#10;&#10;Example: Eva will play first. She decides to move her die that shows a green 5 on top. First, she will move it one space forward. Eva now tilts the die forward so that the green 5 faces forward and the die rests squarely on the next tile forward.&#10;&#10;Now this same die shows a blue 2 on top and she wants to move this one space to the left. She tilts the die to the left so that the blue 2 is now the side facing left and the die lands squarely on the next tile to the left..&#10;&#10;Now this die has a blue 5 on top, and Eva wants to move it one more space forward, so she tilts the die forward, moving the die onto the next tile forward so that his blue 5 faces forward, toward her opponent. Eva's turn is turn is now over.&#10;&#10;At no point during a player's turn may they move their die back onto a tile it has already touched during the same turn. This means players cannot retrace their path or repeat moves during the same turn.&#10;&#10;Dice may not be moved diagonally. Dice may not be rotated.&#10;&#10;2) Making a capture:&#10;When two opposing dice are in adjacent squares, their facing sides are compared. The die with the highest value on its facing side captures the other and the round is over.&#10;&#10;Example: One of Nestor's dice shows a 4 on one side. Eva is able to move her die so that it ends on the space adjacent to this side with a value of 5 facing Nestor's 4. Eva's 5 beats Nestor's 4, so Eva wins the round.&#10;&#10;Dice cannot be captured &quot;in passing.&quot; In other words, the sides of dice are not compared for a capture unless a player has completed all three moves of his or her turn. If dice are in adjacent squares on the first or second move of a turn, there is no comparison of sides and no capture.&#10;&#10;Sometimes, a die will end a turn on a &quot;matching&quot; tile. A die is said to be on a matching tile when its top face is of the same value as the tile. When a die is on a matching tile, all of its outward facing sides double in value for as long as the die remains on the matching tile. This means it may capture a die showing a side of greater value than it would normally be able to capture.&#10;&#10;Example: One of Eva's dice is on a matching space, and its outward facing sides show values of 2, 3, 4, and 4. Because she is on a matching tile, their values are now 4, 6, 8, and 8. As soon as she moves off the tile, their values will return to normal.&#10;&#10;Let's say Eva ended her turn on a matching tile that is adjacent to one of Nestor's dice. His die shows a 6 facing hers, and her die shows a 4 facing his. Ordinarily Eva would lose the round in this position, but because she is on a matching tile, the value of her 4 doubles to an 8. Her 8 beats Nestor's 6 and she wins the round.&#10;&#10;If dice are compared for capture and their values are equal, no capture takes place on that turn.&#10;&#10;STARTING A NEW ROUND&#10;&#10;Once a capture has been made, players collect their dice and prepare for a new round. Players should decide before a game begins whether or not they want the ability to remake their dice between rounds. Unless otherwise stated, dice should retain their composition for the duration of the game, and the board should likewise remain intact for all 3-5 rounds.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has won three rounds and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The game dates back to the turn of the 18th century and is based on xiangqi and go as well as shogi. Credit for its invention has been given to Confucian scholar Ogy&#197;&#171; Sorai. Unlike standard shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured. Promotion rules are complex, and the fates of several pieces are interdependent. The objective is to capture the opponent's commanding pieces: The general, plus the governor if present, or either the banner or middle army if not. Two players, Black and White, play on a go board ruled into a grid of 19 ranks (rows) by 19 files (columns) with a total of 361 intersections. Each player has a set of 90 pieces of 34 different types. The pieces are round and flattened like go stones. In all, the players must remember 65 different moves. The pieces are generally of the same size, though black pieces may be slightly larger than white pieces. Each piece has its name in the form of one or two Japanese characters marked on its face, in white on black stones and in black on white stones. On the reverse side of most pieces are other characters in red; this side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. - Wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Necromantic acolytes are dueling in a deserted graveyard to become the most powerful Necromancer! This is achieved by collecting arcane tomes of power &amp; the chest of ultimate secrets, or by destroying your enemies minions with devastating spells and hordes of undead monsters.&#10;&#10;This game has been taken to several war gaming conventions in the uK where it achieved Best Participation game at Warfare (Reading 2010)&#10;&#10;The games consists of 4 players each representing a Necromancer in charge of an undead horde. To begin with eaxh player has 3 ghouls, these are; fast, good at searching but weak in combat. During each turn the players will raise a skeleton and a zombie to supplement their force. So more figures will enter play as the game progresses. The turn order is determined randomly by pulling stones from a bag. There are six stones, one for each player and the other two represent the resurrection of skeleton &amp; zombie. When a players stone is drawn, they are allowed to move all their figures. No diagonal movement is allowed, nor are you allowed to enter a space occupied by other players pieces, and finally there's a stcking limit of 4 figures per area. After moving any figures against to an enemy must fight (this is compulsory), otherwise they may search for artifacts. Specially prepared dice are used for both searching &amp; combat. These dice have the following faces; 2 x swords, 1 x shield, 2 x eye and 1 x swirl. During searching a number of dice are rolled, if any show the 'eye' the item has been found and will need to be carried back to the Necromancer in order to be used or scored. In combat, both players roll their respective dice, lokking for swords or shields. Basically a shield will negate a sword, any any excess swords on either side will kill a minion each. Spells can be played to influence the outcome of a battle ie 'Battle rage' - All swirls count as swords, thereby increasing your chance of killing your opponents figures.&#10;&#10;zombies are slow, not good in searching but the best fighters, skeletons are average across the board. The Necromancer himself, is very good at searching, but otherwise similar to a skeleton.Points are awarded for kills and for collecting items. The first player to acquire 25 points wins. Sets of gems are worth more than singles, scrolls give you another spell but are not worth any points, relics are worth 2 points, the chest is 4 (this is placed in the centre of the board) and potions are worth 1 but can be used in combat to roll an extra die. Kills are worth 2 points each, however the Necromancer is immortal so each wound he takes is worth 2.&#10;&#10;",

It is based on a simplified version of the &quot;Wargames Rules for Armoured Warfare 1950-1985&quot;, published by the Wargames Research Group (WRG) in 1979. It is played on a terrain model using miniatures representing single vehicles, infantry sections, and crew-served weapons. Players adopt the roles of commanders of platoon or company sized groups. The game requires at least a neutral player in the role of controller, who sets the scenario, supervises play and resolves disputes. Combat is resolved by percentile dice rolls on probability tables, modified by range, suppression status, movement and terrain.&#10;&#10;Editor John Curry added some weapon tables for the British and American Army, and additional information and order of battles for Canadian, Warsaw Pact and British forces.&#10;&#10;",

Terra Shrinka has a unique lunar tide system that controls the water and will erode the island if you don't work together to scout out the island, gather resources, and build dams fast enough.&#10;&#10;THE STORY SO FAR&#10;&#10;On a South Pacific flight your plane is struck by lighting and makes an emergency landing on a small desert island.  The good news is that everyone survived the landing, the bad news is that the tides are rising and the island is flooding.  It's up to the brave passengers to step forward and bring order to the chaos.  You survived the crash, now can you survive the flood?  The very earth is shrinking around you!  Can you dam the flood?&#10;&#10;THE OBJECTIVE&#10;&#10;Dam the flood by creating an unbroken chain of dams from one board edge to the other and protect the crash-site in the process!&#10;&#10;HOW THE GAME PLAYS&#10;&#10;The game starts with the board taking its turn. The board&rsquo;s turn is broken into five phases:&#10;&#10;1. Move Moon Tracker&#10;2. Add Flood Cube(s)&#10;3. Roll Moon Die that matches current Moon Phase&#10;4. Draw card if &ldquo;N&rdquo; or &ldquo;S&rdquo; is rolled.&#10;5. Move Flood water and resolve damage&#10;&#10;After the water does a good job of destroying board squares, it is the players&rsquo; turn. Each player starts with their Team Leader in the Crash Site. During the players&rsquo; turn, they do the following:&#10;&#10;1. Explore and Move&#10;2. Create&#10;3. Transfer&#10;4. Set Dams&#10;&#10;Each player has a starting character. Are you the ren-faire blacksmith, or are you the bag lady? No matter whom, it is each team&rsquo;s job to explore this uncharted little island. The survivors find food to bribe more recruits off the plane. They make networks of people to transfer gathered goods. And finally, they create and set dams to stop the water. This requires lots of communication and teamwork to protect your Crash Site and stop the water from spreading any more. If your Crash Site is destroyed, you lose. Otherwise, keep track of how many squares were destroyed when you finally blocked off the flood and try to do better next time. There are additional scenarios to add replay value and ensure that you want to come back for more.&#10;&#10;",

There is a nice combination of risk assessment and dexterity: the farther up the opponent's side you get your ball to go, the more points -- the rows of holes score 1, 2 or 3 points.  If you miss and it rolls back into a hole on your side, it counts for your opponent's score.  And if you roll off the far side, your opponent keeps the ball to roll and score on his own.&#10;&#10;",

It is used in schools of the German state of Rheinland-Pfalz, with the goal of inspiring students to put pressure on their communities to buy fair trade goods. &#10;Up to five players represent importers of third world goods (bananas, stones, coffee, tea and cotton clothes), trying to be the one with the greatest profit who doesn't get caught either overcharging the buyers or inhumanly exploiting the producers. The board has five tracks, one for each product (for the sake of the game, they all have the same price). On the track, there are three markers: The lowest is the price that the producers get; the middle one represents the overall cost including shipping costs, the third one the price that a municipality buys the goods for (the distance between the latter two is the profit margin). The mechanism is a simple &quot;play one card, draw one card&quot;. The cards have events printed on them, with each event either influencing the own track (with some choices to make) or that of another player. There are also hidden cards which can be played face-down to another player's track. These are revealed at the end of the game and influence the the maximum prize a municipality will pay and the maximum abuse of producers it will tolerate. A player who exceeds either of these levels is out of the game; the remaining player with the highest profit margin is the winner.&#10;The game has some push your luck element (you can make a rough guess about the tolerable levels from the number of cards played against you) and is embedded in a curricular project in the schools of the state. &#10;It is not for sale nor does it come in a box. 12 copies were hand-made by Reinhold Wittig, of which 10 copies will be used in schools beginning in 2011.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the game) THE OIL IS RUNNING OUT! The days of easy drilling are long gone and oil companies are searching in ever deeper, riskier and more fragile places just to secure our daily fix&#29;x of capitalist cog-grease. The battle is on to protect these areas from the next 'Deepwater Horizon' and with a couple of dice, a few coins and a friend, you can re-enact this struggle. It's Greenpeace vs. the Oil Company, trying to establish marine reserves in the very territory the other player wants to exploit. Through a mix of strategic lobbying, exploration, occupation and reserve creation, one of you will triumph. But beware: too many blowouts and you'll have a deepwater slaughter on your hands. And if all the animals die, you both lose!&#10;&#10;&#10;You only need some coins and 2 dice to play. Everything else is included in the files. Game play takes place on a grided map of the ocean, containing squares of varying depths of water. One player takes on the role of environmental activists, Greenpeace, while the other, the role of a Big Nasty Oil company. Greenpeace is trying to establish marine reserves in the very places that Big Oil is trying to drill. You see, oil (in the form of coins) is available everywhere, but severely limited in shallow and medium depths. So once the easy oil runs out, the oil company is pushed into deep water. Drilling involves rolling two dice, one after the other. If the second number is larger than the first, this drill results in profit (coins equal to the difference in the two numbers) but if you roll a double, it's a blow out. Blow outs are more damaging in deeper water and any blow out might affect surrounding wildlife (animal counters are distributed randomly for each game). If any one species gets totally wiped out, both players lose.&#10;&#10;Each player has 3 strategies to choose from each turn and there is enough variation to ensure that no single outcome is guaranteed (although a lot of animals consistently die).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Designed for the 2010 Christmas Print and Play Game Design Contest, Jingle Jangle is a domino-like placement game which scores points for arranging tiles into the appropriate patterns.&#10;&#10;Jingle Jangle uses a special set of 30 tiles with two bells on them called jangles. The game can be played by two, three or four players and the size of the hand varies with the number of players.&#10;&bull; Two players get 14 jangles each, with two jangles left over.&#10;&bull; Three players get 9 jangles each, with three jangles left over.&#10;&bull; Four players get 7 jangles each, with two jangles left over.&#10;In the case of three left over jangles, one is put away out of the game and not exposed, to leave two jangles in the starter. The starter is the pair of left over jangles. These are turned face up and put side by side to make a square in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;Jangles are placed on the table, vertically or horizontally, played out from the starter square. The idea is to build a &ldquo;crossword puzzle&rdquo; grid of repeated color patterns in the rows and columns.&#10;&#10;Any set of two or more adjacent jangles ending in a row or column is called a group. The jangles must be played so that the bells in each group form a (repeating) pattern. The possible patterns are:&#10;&#10;&bull; a single color repeated, example: red, red, red or&#10;&bull; two colors alternating, example: red, blue, red, blue, red, blue or&#10;&bull; three colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow or&#10;&bull; four colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, red, blue, yellow, green or&#10;&bull; or all five colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, red, blue, yellow, green, purple&#10;As soon as a group has a repeated color in it, or contains all five colors, the pattern for that group is fixed, and future jangles that extend the group must conform to the established pattern. As the layout grows, it is possible for a row or column to contain two or more groups, separated by spaces.&#10;&#10;Each jangle must be placed so that it correctly extends two or more groups, but you are not allowed to create a set of four jangles side by side in the layout, touching along their long sides.&#10;&#10;If a player thinks he cannot play, he exposes his hand. The other players can then (if they wish) point out any plays he might not have seen. In this case the player must play a tile. If more than one possible play is pointed out, the player has the option of picking the one he likes. If no play is pointed out, then the player scores zero and places no jangle. He is not out of the game, but has to wait for his next turn to see if he can then find a play.&#10;&#10;The game ends one of two ways: 1) When one player places all his jangles. The other players who started after him get to place one more jangle, however. 2) When no player can place a jangle.&#10;&#10;Scores are counted and added as the jangles are placed. Each bell on a jangle is worth 5 points, The score is the product of the new lengths of all extended groups. If the jangle used to extend the group is a double, then the score is also doubled.&#10;&#10;All players lose points for the jangles remaining in their hands when the game is ended. Doubles are -5 points and all other jangles are -25 points.&#10;&#10;",

As well as one sheet of 15 new double sided Terrain Tiles.&#10;&#10;Rules-wise, if you are familiar with Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble at all learning the special rules for Hoplite infantry, for the basic game mechanics remain unchanged. Battle dice still resolve combat quickly and the Command cards provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities for victory.&#10; As with all Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients expansions to date, the tactics you will need to execute with these Hoplite armies will conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to these historical units, their weapons, the terrain and history. &#10; - Publisher Page&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;* Rule/Scenario Booklet that features 26 historical scenarios&#10;    * 1 Reference Card&#10;    * 228 Blocks&#10;    * Block Label sheets&#10;    * 2 Terrain Tile Sheets: each contains 15 double-sided Terrain Tiles&#10;&#10;Per back of box:  You need the base game of C&amp;C:A and you need C&amp;C Ancients Expansion Number 1 (Greece and Eastern Kingdoms).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overview&#10;&#10;Guesstimates is a strategic guessing game for 2-4 players or teams, which focuses on making intelligent estimates. Your goal is to occupy as large an area as possible on the game board using the blocks that you receive as rewards for making accurate guesses. Blocks are available in three different lengths and the better your guess, the longer the block you receive. Questions belong to three categories: Market, Technology and Brainteaser.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game &#10;Each round starts with the question category being determined by a roll of the die.&#10;&#10;One of the players reads the question aloud and when all players understand the question, the timer is started and all players have 90 seconds to make educated guesses and estimate as good a guess as possible. The players&rsquo; answers must be recorded in the block before the 90 seconds is out.&#10;&#10;0, 1, 2 or 3 points then are distributed&#10;&#10;The players put their points out on the board according to the rules below. The player with the least number of playing squares covered with points places theirs first, followed by the player with the second smallest number of covered playing squares, and so on. If two players have the same number of covered playing squares, then the player who is next to read a question places their points first.&#10;&#10;The turn then goes to the next player and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Distributing the points&#10;&#10;A correct answer within &plusmn; 25% gives 2 points.&#10;&#10;If the answer is further away than &plusmn; 25% but within the range (10 x correct answer) to (1 / 10 x correct answer), the player receives 1 point.&#10;&#10;The player who comes closest to the correct answer receives +1 point regardless of whether any points are obtained as described above.&#10;&#10;Placing the points and winning the game&#10;&#10;When new points are placed on the game board, they must be positioned adjacent to a previously played point of the same color.&#10;&#10;In addition to the points themselves, players also get points for empty playing squares contained within a border of their lines of points, so it is tactically advantageous to build outwards to the edge of the game board.&#10;&#10;When any player has a point that cannot be placed on the board, the game is over. The number of playing squares contained within each players&rsquo; delimited fields is calculated and added to their number of covered playing fields &ndash; the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",
