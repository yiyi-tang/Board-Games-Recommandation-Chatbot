    "Description": "The vast Forest of Wyr was once ruled by three powerful siblings: Callius, the Lion - known for his strength on the battlefield as well as for his cruelty, Tellard, the Serpent - his face always hidden, who sought out Wyr&rsquo;s enemies with insidious dark magijks, and Amalfia, known as the Sun, also facetiously as &lsquo;the Lucky Star&rsquo; - she for whom everything went as she wished, enticing all who fell under her spell, setting friend against friend, brother against brother.&#10;&#10;It was rumored in taverns, and in the low places favored by thieves, that the source of their power lay in six enchanted gems, hidden away deep within a network of towers in the Forest of Wyr and only the siblings and their loyal Guardians knew of their exact locations.&#10;&#10;There came a time when a Thief of some infamy decided to test these rumours to see if they were true and dared to steal the gems. There would be a high price to pay if caught, but then, what is life without challenge! Across the boundary line of Wyr and into the shadows of the great trees the Thief slowly ventured...&#10;&#10;Needed to play:&#10;The deck of 70 cards divided into Realm, Guardian, Forest Spirit, Stillness and Towers decks.&#10;1 mug or small bag, used as the Tower&#10;65 8mm wooden cubes in 6 different colors&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;To win the game you must find all 6 Gems before you are unable to draw new cards from the last of the 3 Encounter decks.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. Each round has two phases: Encounter and Tower Search.&#10;&#10;Encounter Phase:&#10;Choose one Tower card from the three face-up cards as the Tower you are searching during this round and place this in front of you. Then draw a new card from the Tower deck and place it next to the two remaining Tower cards. &#10;Draw 4 cards from the Encounter deck above the leftmost Realm card. &#10;Encounter each card in turn in the Encounter Line, first by applying any Actions shown on the cards. In any Encounter you may choose to Evade or Incapacitate.&#10;&#10;Tower Search Phase:&#10;After all cards in the Encounter Line have been encountered by evading or incapacitating, you may now search the Tower. &#10;Follow any actions listed on the chosen Tower card, paying icons on the Guardian cards in your hand to the Encounter discard pile if you wish to activate the actions.&#10;Then randomly draw cubes equal to the number of Tower icons showing on the bottom right corner of the remaining Encounter Line cards. The number of cubes drawn may be modified by cards you have incapacitated and/or actions you are subject to, either from the Encounter Line or from the Tower.&#10;&#10;Round End:&#10;Discard all cards in the Encounter Line and begin a new round of Encounter and Tower Search phases.&#10;&#10;Game End: &#10;You win if you find all 6 enchanted gems in the Towers.&#10;&#10;You lose if you do not find all 6 gems before you are unable to draw new cards from the 3 Encounter decks, or if any two Abilities ever reach zero during an encounter.&#10;&#10;Entry in the 2016 Solitaire Game Contest&#10;Best Regular PNP Build Game - 2nd Place&#10;Best Graphic Design - 1st Place &#10;Best Rule Book - 3rd Place&#10;Best Overall Game - 4th Place&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A deck building card game based on the Battle Nations Video Game. Each player controls their own outpost.&#10;&#10;Each player gets his own small Imperial Basic Deck.  All cards in this deck have 2 basic Traits: Build and Fight. Build is used to recruit units, characters, and buildings. Fight is used to defeat threats. Besides the Build and Fight Traits, cards also have additional abilities including:  Draw, Store, Replace, Heal or Repair, Gain VP, and modifiers that increase their traits or the traits of other cards.&#10;&#10;Players also share three Common Decks:&#10;Threat Deck (Missions and Invasions)&#10;Building Deck&#10;Unit Deck (Units and Characters)&#10;&#10;-   Each player shuffles their Basic Deck and draws 5 cards. &#10;-   Shuffle the 3 common decks. All decks are face-down. &#10;-   Place the top 4 cards of the Threat Deck face-up in a line in the middle of the table.  These 4 cards are known as the Threat Spread. There must always be 4 cards in the Threat Spread. &#10;-   Similarly make spreads for the Building and Unit Decks.  &#10;-   As play proceeds each player will have a modified Basic Deck, a hand of 5 cards, their discard pile, a victory pile (defeated Threats), and a storage pile.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising two phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Action Phase&#10;-   Play cards from your hand (played cards are put in your discard).&#10;-   Use Build points to recruit buildings, units, and characters from the Building and Unit Spreads.  The cost of a card in build points is its Recruitment Cost (RC).  When a card is recruited, place it in your discard pile. &#10;-   Use Fight points to defeat threats from the Threat Spread. The cost to defeat a threat in fight points is its Threat Value (TV).  Place defeated Threats into your victory pile.  &#10;-   At the end of the phase discard all un-played cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;2.  Draw Phase&#10;-   Draw 6 cards from your deck to form your hand for next turn. &#10;-   If you have no cards left in your deck, shuffle your discard and draw from it.&#10;&#10;Victory tokens are earned by playing certain cards. Place VT into your Victory Pile along with defeated Threat cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the turn any common deck is used up. &#10;Add up your VT (Victory Tokens) plus the TV (Threat Value) of all Threat cards in your victory pile, deck, hand, and discards.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game for 2-4+ players. Theme: The social and political revolutions in the Middle East and North African countries circa 2010+.&#10;&#10;The board is a circular track of 50 spaces.  Each space is large enough to hold 1 card.  There are 2 types of Spaces: Revolution and Country. Eleven countries are represented: Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Oman, Yemen, Syria, Jordan, Bahrain, Iran and Iraq.  Each country will comprise either three or four spaces.&#10;&#10;Players share a Common Deck. There are three main types of cards: Revolution Cards, Resistance Cards, Motivation Cards&#10;&#10;Players share a common set of Victory Tokens. &#10;Each player has a pawn and a set of counters of a unique colour.&#10;&#10;All players draw 2 cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising five Phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Draw Phase&#10;-   Draw 1 card and place it in your hand. &#10;-   You may discard a motivation card to draw 2 cards.&#10;&#10;2.  Move Phase&#10;-   Roll 1 die and move forward that many spaces OR discard a card from your hand and move forward a number of spaces equal to its force value. &#10;-   If you land on a Revolution Space you may do one of four actions: &#10;    -   Roll the die and move again&#10;    -   Move to any other revolution space on the Board&#10;    -   Draw 1 Card and place it in your hand&#10;    -   Play a Counter onto any Country Space you have radicalised.&#10;&#10;3.  Action Phase&#10;-   If you land on a Country Space that has no card on it, you may play a Revolution card to that space. Tuck it partially under the Board directly next to the space. Place 1 of your counters on the space if you placed a card there. If you have a card under a space you are said to have radicalised it. If a country already has 1 card of the same type, you cannot play a second. For example Tunisia can only have 1 Intervention card tucked under its spaces.   &#10;-   If you land on a Country Space that you have already radicalised (You have a card and one or more counters there already) you may do one of the following: &#10;    -  Place an additional counter on the Space.&#10;    -  Exchange the tucked card with one from your hand.&#10;    -  Draw 1 card and discard 1 card (it may be the same card). &#10;-   If you land on a country space radicalised by another player, you can either do nothing or play one or more resistance cards with a combined force value equal to or greater than the number of counters your opponent has on the space. If you do so, discard all the counters on the space and the card tucked under it. Remove the resistance cards from the game. &#10;-   If you land on a country space that is overthrown skip over it and go to the next space and resume your move.&#10;&#10;4.  Overthrow Phase&#10;-   If you played a revolution card under a country space this turn and all the other spaces for that country have already been radicalised (by you or others) the country is now said to have been overthrown. Immediately score Victory Tokens (VT) for the country. &#10;-   You gain 2 Victory Tokens for playing the final card to overthrow the country. &#10;-   The player with the highest combined total of counters and card force values gets 5 VT. &#10;-   The player with the second highest total of counters and card force values gets 3 VT. &#10;-   All other players with at least 1 card and counter in the country get 1 VT each. &#10;Overthrown Countries are out of play.  Pawns cannot land on them, they simply move past them without counting them.&#10;&#10;5.  End Phase&#10;-   Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when 4 countries have been overthrown. &#10;Each player gets 1 extra VT for each Space they have a counter in. &#10;The player with the most VT at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2-4+ players. A game of social advancement in 17th century France in which players, by means of the purchase of ennobling offices, advance their bourgeoisie families into the aristocracy.&#10;&#10;Each player builds up 1 family at a time.  Once a family has been ennobled and has an income of 30+ silver per turn from investments, it is retired and the player must start a new family.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck comprising card types:  Families, Trade, Bonds, Land, Offices, and Events. The Land, Bond, and Office types are collectively called Investments. Most cards have a value and may also have special characteristics.&#10;&#10;The opportunity track has a place for the deck and 10 cards to be laid out: &#10;Discard | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | Deck&#10;A card&rsquo;s position on the track is the cost in opportunity tokens to take it.&#10;&#10;There are 4 different types of Common Markers: silver coins, gold coins upgrade markers and opportunity tokens&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 1 random family card in play and with 1D10 Silver. &#10;10 cards are laid randomly to each of the 10 spaces on the opportunity Track.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn divided into 9 phases: &#10;1.  Family Phase&#10;-   If you have no family card in play you may put one in play from your hand at no cost. You may have a max of 1 non-retired family card in play at a time.  Cards in play are placed face up in front of you. &#10;-   You may put a trade card in play for gold equal to its value. You may not put a trade card into play if you don&rsquo;t have a family card in play.&#10;&#10;2.  Revenue Phase&#10;-   Gain Silver equal to the combined value of every card you have in play for your most current family.&#10;&#10;3.  Fate Phase&#10;-   Gain 1D6 Opportunity Tokens (OT).  OT can be saved from turn to turn.&#10;&#10;4.  Opportunity Phase&#10;-   You may buy cards on the Opportunity Track using your OT. Place these cards into your hand. A card&rsquo;s position on the track is the cost in OT to take it. Some Event cards are resolved as soon as you buy them.&#10;&#10;5.  Capital Phase&#10;-   You may discard one or more cards from your hand. Gain silver equal to the value of the discarded cards.&#10;&#10;6.  Conversion Phase&#10;-   Convert silver to gold. Every 10 silver converts into 1 gold. Keep the change.&#10;&#10;7.  Investment Phase&#10;-   If you have a trade card in play with your current family, you may buy Land and/or Bond cards from your hand. These cost gold equal to their value. A family may have multiple Land and Bond cards in play. &#10;-   If your current family has at least one Land in play, you may buy an Office card for gold equal to its value. A family may not have more office cards in play than land cards.&#10;&#10;8.  Noblement Phase&#10;-   If your current family has at least 1 office and is making 30+ Silver per turn, it may retire. &#10;-   If it is making 50+ Silver per turn, you must retire it, even if it has no office. &#10;-   Set the retired Family aside in its own stack.&#10;-   When retiring, you must discard all your gold.  &#10;-   Next turn you may start a new family.&#10;&#10;9.  End Phase&#10;-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;-   If there is a card in the 1 spot on the Opportunity track discard it. Then slide all the remaining cards down from 10 to 1 filling in all empty spaces on the Track.  Flip over cards from the deck to fill in empty spots (starting with the 10)&#10;&#10;The game ends when a turn ends and there are no cards left in the deck.&#10;&#10;Score Prestige Points (PP) for each of your families. A family gets PP equal to the value of its Lands and Offices. If a retired family has no Offices it gets -5 PP. Get an extra +5 PP for each retired family you have after the first.&#10;&#10;The player with the most Prestige Points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

One of the cards allow to win the game, another to draw more cards, etc.&#10;When a player attacks another, he can play Fierras or Pallares cards. Fierras are played first. The target player discards as many cards as the attacking player's Fierras cards values.&#10;Pallares are played little by little : the attacking player plays some, the defender can counter by equalling the value, the attacking adds more, etc. If the attacker wins, he/she picks one card in the target player's hand at random for himself.&#10;It is possible to pass a turn to draw more cards.&#10;&#10;",

The winner of the fight may steal a card at the other.&#10;The cards can be used to create shortcuts on the board for one self. Or to prevent others to go to the end of the path.

    "Description": "A space colonisation game for 2-5 players in which players attempt to establish high scoring colonies before their opponents.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck formed of seven different cards types: Planets, Ships, Extractors, Protection, Distance, Events and Growth.  &#10;&#10;       Planet cards have 2 attributes: hazards and resources.  There are 8 types of hazard and 8 types of resource.&#10;       There are 4 types of ship cards, representing 4 propulsion types and 4 corresponding levels of speed. Certain ships cannot be used with certain distance Cards. &#10;       There are 4 types of Extractor card. Each type of extractor can successfully extract 2 types of resource. Additionally, each Extractor card has a secondary trait of colonist. There are 6 types of colonists each worth a different amount of points in settlement scoring. &#10;       Each hazard has a specific type of protection card required to overcome it. Each protection card has a secondary trait of control. There are three types of control each worth a different number of points in settlement scoring. &#10;       Each distance card lists a distance value from 7 to 30. Each distance card also has an obstruction attribute. There are five types of obstruction.  Each obstruction type may prevent the use of one specific ship type. &#10;       Event cards have a wide range of game altering effects such as increasing or decreasing trip times; stealing or destroying colonies; stealing, gaining, or losing cards; stealing, gaining, or losing VP.&#10;       Growth cards are added to a player&rsquo;s existing colony. A single colony can have a maximum of one growth card attached. &#10;&#10;&#10;To start each player is dealt 5 cards.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising eight phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Draw Phase&#10;&#10;       Each player draws 1 card from the top of the deck and puts it in their hands. &#10;&#10;&#10;2.  Trade Phase&#10;&#10;       Players may trade cards from their hands. They may also trade ownership of missions and colonies.  &#10;&#10;&#10;3.  Event Phase&#10;&#10;       The current player may play 1 event card or 1 growth card from his hand. Discard event cards once they are played. &#10;&#10;&#10;4.  Travel Phase&#10;&#10;       The current player places travel markers on his missions. &#10;         A mission with solar sails adds 1 travel marker.&#10;         A mission with gravity repulsors adds 2 travel markers. &#10;         A mission with a ram scoop adds 3 travel markers. &#10;         A mission with an antimatter drive adds 4 travel markers. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;5.  Launch Phase&#10;&#10;     The current player may launch a mission. A mission consists of 5 cards: 1 planet card, 1 ship card, 1 extractor card, 1 protection card, 1 distance card. All cards in a Mission must be compatible with each other, for instance, the protection card must be specific to the hazard type of the planet card. The stack of mission cards are placed face-up and staggered so as to be visible to all players&#10;&#10;&#10;6.  Settlement Phase&#10;&#10;     A Mission that has accumulated travel markers equal to or greater than the distance value listed on the mission&rsquo;s distance card has arrived at its destination planet and set up a functioning, established colony. &#10;     The player in control of the mission colony immediately scores a number of VP = the value of the resource type plus the value of the colonists type plus the value of the control type. &#10;     Represent the conversion of the mission into a colony by discarding the distance and ship cards and the travel markers. Keep the Planet, extractor, and protection cards stacked face up in front of you. &#10;&#10;&#10;7.  Scoring Phase&#10;&#10;     The current Player gains 1 VP for each colony he has in play. &#10;&#10;&#10;8.  End Phase&#10;&#10;     Current player max hand size = 8 cards.  Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as ten colonies are in play.  Check for each of the 8 resource types.  The player with the most colonies of a type gains an extra 3 VP.  The player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2-4+ players based on the Cow Click social network game.&#10;&#10;Players share two common decks: The Basic Cow Deck and The Premium Cow Deck. Each cow is worth a certain amount of mooney as listed on its card. Mooney levels are low in the basic deck and higher in the premium deck. Optional event cards can be added to the basic deck which take effect as soon as they are revealed and then immediately discarded.&#10;&#10;To set up, 7 starting cards are separated from the premium deck and laid out face-up in &ldquo;the stockyard&rdquo; - the middle of the playing area. &#10;The basic and premium cards are shuffled separately into two decks. &#10;When shuffling the premium deck, 10 cards including the Cowmageddon card are shuffled separately and set to one side. This is known as the Cowntdown deck and comes into play towards the end of the game when the remainder of the premium deck runs out.&#10;&#10;Each player draws 3 cards from the basic cow deck and puts them in their &ldquo;pasture&rdquo; (the area directly in front of them)&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising five phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Sale Phase&#10;-   You may discard a basic cow. The most basic cows you can have in your pasture is 5.&#10;&#10;2.  Buy Phase&#10;-   If you have 4 or less basic cows in your pasture, you may draw the top card of the basic deck and add it to your pasture. You may only add 1 basic cow to your pasture this way per turn.&#10;&#10;3.  Upgrade Phase&#10;-   You may discard 2 or more cows (basic and/or premium) to gain a premium cow, from the stockyard, with a mooney value exactly equal to the total mooney value of the cows you discarded. For Example: There is a 17 Mooney cow available as one of the 7 stockyard cows.  You have in your pasture a 5 mooney cow, a 2 mooney cow, and a 10 mooney cow. (5 + 2 + 10 = 17). You discard them to get the 17 mooney cow and put it in your pasture.&#10;&#10;4.  Stockyard Phase&#10;-   If there are less than 7 stockyard cows available, flip over the top cards of the Premium deck until there are 7. If one of these is the Cowmageddon card the game ends.&#10;&#10;5.  Out to Pasture Phase&#10;-   Take the highest Mooney cow from the Stockyard and place it on the bottom of the Premium deck. If you are into the Cowntdown deck, skip this phase.&#10;&#10;Players may trade (or Gift) Cows at any time. Trades (but not gifts) must be acceptable to both parties. The most basic cows you can have in your pasture is 5 and you cannot gift or trade someone basic cows if it would cause them to exceed their limit. You can have any number of premium cows.&#10;&#10;The Game ends when the Cowmageddon Card is revealed. Your score is equal to the total Mooney value of all your cows divided by the number of cows in your pasture. (get the calculators...)&#10;The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Escabel is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA stack is a set of one or more pieces piled onto each other on the same point. The color of a stack is the color of its topmost piece, which denotes its owner. The height of a stack is the number of pieces in it.&#10;&#10;A crosscut is a 2x2 area containing two diagonally adjacent black stacks and two diagonally adjacent white stacks.&#10;&#10;Two like-colored stacks are considered connected in the following cases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     They are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to each other and not part of the same crosscut.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     They are both part of the same crosscut and higher than the lower enemy stack in that crosscut.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of these actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a piece of your color on an empty point.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move the topmost piece of a stack of your color onto an orthogonally adjacent enemy stack, provided that, before the move, the heights of both stacks are the same. Then, place a piece of your opponent's color onto the stack from which you just moved your piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;You win if, at the start of your turn, there is a chain of connected stacks of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. You lose if, at the start of your turn, your opponent has such a chain and you have no moves available.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesFor a variant, allow piece movement only between stacks that belong to the same crosscut, or start the game with the board fully covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the two possible checkered setups may be used.&#10;&#10;Escabel was inspired by Matteo Perlini's Consta.&#10;&#10;",

Participants race as fast as they can to reach specific checkpoints in time throughout a day and then race back to the moment they left. The racer with the least amount of time missing on his internal clock wins! Beware of other racers on the time track as they can short you out and make you miss your connection! Pick up tricks, weapons, and boosters when successfully hitting your time checkpoints in your silly little time machine! This is a very easy game with lots of fun stuff going on. Totally safe for kids over 4 who don't put random stuff in their mouths. &#10;1-5 Players pick unusual time machines each with their own weapons or abilities and then race around 6 clocks using a 13 spaced spinner and 2 dice. Players pick up boosters as they lock in checkpoints in time and try not to be lost in the fabric of time and space by shorting out. Depending on the number of players short out limits can be 3-6. If a player completely shorts out all acquired checkpoints and cards are lost and the player must pick a new time machine card to start over.&#10;&#10;Booster cards are acquired by locking in a checkpoint each player has the chance to collect a total of 5 of these in a game and they can give the user special weapons, advancements, or tricks. After all players have locked in a checkpoint time wraith tokens are placed on the five outer clocks. These devil drivers are trying to catch you. Some are good and some are bad. The spinner is used any time the game starts to find your spot on the central clock or anytime someone either shorts out or locks in a clock and must return to the central clock to continue. There are 6 black holes on the board. One on the 13 in the central clock and 5 on the bands that lead out to the outer clocks. These short you out as well as if any player lands on you. after the spinner is used players roll 2 dice to advance Players must travel up the next band to the next clock that they do not already have acquired. If a player rolls doubles They go again but after 3 sets of doubles the player shorts out. &#10; To win players must lock in all checkpoints on the outer clocks by landing on the set time indicated on the clocks and then return to the center clock and lock it in as well.&#10; This game comes with colored stones to place as markers when clocks are locked in, custom cast pewter game pawns, wraith tokens, and spinner device set in laser cut 1/8th-inch birch, an Eco canvas 18-inch game board and, a few extra black holes for the black hole generators.&#10;&#10;",

Jones. The game was released (and sold out) at the Tokyo Game Market in May 2017 in a very small, home-made production run.&#10;&#10;The explorers must discover three chambers within the pyramid; the King's chamber, the Queen's chamber, and the King's hidden chamber, and then find the exit and escape. To do so, they have an ancient document and must decipher its instructions to reveal the pyramid's secrets. Failure means the curse of the Pharaoh will strike!&#10;&#10;They fail if they run out of time, or if they cannot explore any more, having misread the secret writings. Key to the game is the ancient book which the players hold. At the start of the game, the pages in the book are mixed up. The players can only read a few pages from the start, and then place a bookmark on a page. The pages have actions, traps, and some icons to discover.&#10;&#10;If the bookmarked page is an action, it is activated. If it is a trap, it is disabled. But traps that are not bookmarked can be triggered. Some pages grant icons to be carried be a player, and some actions need icons to activate. Since this is a co-operative expedition, players may swap icons between them, but at the cost of a player's turn.&#10;&#10;The players have a limited set of bookmarks, and so must choose carefully which pages to mark. They can continue deciphering the book from a previous bookmark, but only a few pages at a time.&#10;&#10;When the start player's turn comes around, the time token moves, which might invoke the curse! If so, the players must escape the pyramid quickly or perish!&#10;&#10;The pyramid is made from wood and plastic, the rooms from folded paper, and the ancient book is a filofax - a refillable pocket binder. The bookmarks are small post-it notes. The game is long and weighs a kilo.&#10;&#10;Players comments on Twitter say the game reminds them a little of T.I.M.E Stories, a game bound by time. And that the home-made appearance is deceiving, the gameplay is very strong. The actual pages from the ancient book are not shown anywhere, maintaining the secrecy of the game (which therefore must be very language dependent).&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Excavate the newly found pyramid. Decipher the ancient document, deactivate the deadly traps and find your way to exit safely.&#10;&#10;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#164;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#232;&#170;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#141;&#177;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#231;&#189;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#184;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Savannah is a highly tactical drafting game about scarce resources.&#10;&#10;Introduction&#10;The African summer sun is burning down, heat shimmers over the wide land. Food becomes scarce and the fight for survival begins. Herds and prides of numerous Savannah residents get a move on the draining water holes, trying to get an edge on the last food resources with cunning and trickery.&#10;&#10;Aim of the Game&#10;Players are trying to maintain the balance between animals and resources in the Savannah. The resource that a player collected the least of is crucial for end game scoring (a player's score is equal to her worst-scoring resource, not her best). The player whose least collected resource exceeds the least collected resources of the other players wins.&#10;&#10;Course of the Game&#10;One game consists of a set number of rounds.&#10;One round consist of the following four phases:&#10;&#10;(1) Dawn &ndash; choosing Animal cards (drafting)&#10;(2) Noon &ndash; placing Animal tokens (add to play area)&#10;(3) Sunset &ndash; resolving the course of the day (scoring)&#10;(4) Night &ndash; preparing the next round (clear play area)&#10;&#10;Game End&#10;The game ends after a certain number of rounds, depending on the player count. 4 rounds in a 2&ndash;3 player game and 3 rounds in a 4&ndash;5 player game.&#10;&#10;Each player counts separately each of the food resources and determines the lowest result of these. Compare this result with the result of the other players. Winner of the game is the player with the highest number for this comparison.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;A cooperative sci-fi survival game. Groups of 2-4 players will attempt to defend the lab's shared pool of health from increasingly difficult waves of Enemies.  Allowing too many Enemies or any one of three bosses to break through your defenses will end the game.  Defeat three bosses, however, and you will be able to call in your drop ship and escape with your lives.&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;Advance Phase&#10;Every turn begins with enemy movement. Be cautious, as not all of the creatures move at the same pace! In this phase, any enemies advancing past the first row will cause damage to the players before being discarded.&#10;&#10;Spawn Phase&#10;In the second phase, enemies that were beyond the battlefield now become visible! Similar to their varied movements, not all enemies will spawn into the fight at the same distance from the heroes. Additionally, these monstrosities can crowd spaces, stacking their damage and moving as a group, changing player priorities in a single phase.&#10;&#10;Action Phase&#10;It&rsquo;s time to deal some damage. Emulating the limited access to and repurposing of supplies that would occur during the ambush, player action begins by drawing a small number of cards from the supply deck. Supplies range from energy sources and offensive weapons to traps and support items. A lucky draw in Dreadbound may not directly benefit you, but it could be just what your teammates need. Following the resupply, players may then make one of two combinations of actions: Attack (deal direct damage to the enemy) and Support (repurpose or gift supplies to teammates), or two Support actions. Plan carefully with the rest of the crew to make the most effective play.&#10;&#10;Boss Phase&#10;Take caution with your kills in Dreadbound, as destroying specific enemies eventually leads to the appearance of one of the game&rsquo;s six boss creatures. Each of these sports one or more abilities unique to their card, with a variety of effects that can damage players, as well as disrupt their plans and reset their priorities.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A print and play game of unexplained bovine abduction for two players by Jonathan Leistiko.  One player represents the Alien Leader whilst the other is the Top Cow.&#10;&#10;The goal of the Alien Leader is to abduct enough cows of sufficient quality to complete the experiments necessary to ensure success in the upcoming invasion before the space-time fold device runs out of power and transports them back to Dimension Aleph-Zootie. The goal of the Top Cow is to prevent as many cow abductions as possible.&#10;&#10;To start 20 cows from the cow deck are laid out face down in front of the Top Cow and a cow marker placed on top of them.  The 20 cow pawns (each matched to one of the cow markers) are placed on 20 of the 160 spaces on the playing board &ndash; which represents a pasture.  The Alien Leader&rsquo;s flying saucer token and 3 x alien pawns are placed, together, on any other vacant space.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, the alien and the cow player each roll two dice.  There are four phases in each round - Cow Cards, Alien Research, Alien Activity, and Cow Movement.  The Alien Leader gets to allocate one of the dice he rolled to one of those four phases, then the Top Cow gets to allocate the dice he rolled to two phases that have no dice. By default, the Alien Leader&rsquo;s last die gets assigned to the last phase without a die.&#10;&#10;Cow Cards Phase:&#10;If you&rsquo;re the Top Cow: Draw cards from the Cow Deck equal to the number on the die assigned to the Cow Cards Phase.  Look at the cards you drew.  Put each card face-down under a cow marker in front of you.  No cow may have two cards more than the cow with the least cards on the field.&#10;&#10;Alien Research:&#10;If you&rsquo;re the Alien Leader you get research points equal to the number on the Alien Research die.  You may spend a research point to look at the letter on the bottom of any cow in the field or look at one face-down cow card that&rsquo;s attached to a cow.  You may spend any number of points to look at that many cards on the top of the Cow Cards deck and put them back on top of the deck in any order.&#10;&#10;Alien Activity Phase&#10;If You&rsquo;re the Alien Leader the number on the Alien Activity die indicates how many aliens you can command this round and how many actions your alien(s) can take.  When an alien acts, it can take the following actions: Move, Recover, Abduct, Fly Saucer, Repair Saucer.  The main aim of this phase is for the Alien Leader to manoeuvre pieces around the board with the intent of abducting cows.&#10;&#10;Cow Movement:&#10;If you&rsquo;re the Top Cow you get movement points equal to the number on the Cow Movement die.  You can spend a movement point to move a cow one space. Cows may not move into occupied spaces.&#10;&#10;Once the last cow card is drawn, the Cow Cards phase no longer occurs and cannot have dice assigned to it at the start of a round.  The Alien Leader does not get to assign his second die at the start of each round.&#10;&#10;If there are no cow cards at the start of a turn and you&rsquo;re the Top Cow, roll a die. If it&rsquo;s odd, the game continues. If it&rsquo;s even, the game ends.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, tally the victory points of the cows in the flying saucer.  The Alien wins if he has 45 or more Victory Points.&#10;&#10;",

One player plays the Dark Lord and the remaining players each one hero.&#10;&#10;The Dark Lord powers have been sealed off and he's weak. However, he is recovering slowly in his Dungeon.&#10;&#10;Aware of the coming crisis, the brave heroes enter the Dungeon and start their quest to defeat the Dark Lord in his Dungeon before he can recover his powers.&#10;If they manage to do so they win. Otherwise the Dark Lord kills them and reign over the world.&#10;&#10;The Heroes' goal is to reach the Dark Lord to defeat him for good. From the entrance, they need to reach the Dark Lord's throne: if any Hero player can move to the same room as him, the Heroes wins.&#10;The Dark Lord's goal is to recover enough power or kill off all the Hero players.&#10;&#10;The Game plays roughly as the following.&#10;&#10;0) Setup&#10;First one player gets choosen to be the Dark Lord for the game. He picks up the black character.&#10;Shuffle all the Hazard cards together, return 3 cards to the box and deal 3 to the Dark Lord.&#10;Then, each hero player chooses a colored character and gets assigned randomly a Job card.&#10;Last but not least, the Dungeon tile cards are shuffled layed out as a grid, face down, except for the Dark Lord's throne, in the top left corner, and the dungeon's entrace, in the bottom right corner. Place the Dark Lord character on his throne and the Hero characters all at the entrance.&#10;&#10;1) Heroes' Turn&#10;Each heroes choose secretly one of the following action: Move, Heal or Ability.&#10;When all decided, all the Heroes reveal their action at once and proceed to resolution.

Players will reveal dungeon tile cards as needed when exploring new areas of the dungeon. Be careful of traps!&#10;&#10;2) Dark Lord's Turn&#10;During he can play choose on of the following action: accumulate power, play an Hazard card to attack/delay the Heroes, or renew his hand.&#10;&#10;Repeat 1) and 2) until either:&#10;- any hero reaches the same room as the Dark Love -&gt; the Heroes win&#10;- the Dark Lord has killed all the Heroes or has exhausted the Hazard cards deck.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#189;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#174;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#190;&#169;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#191;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#233;&#130;&#170;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#174;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#190;&#169;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#191;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#176;&#129;&#229;&#141;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#231;&#150;&#142;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#141;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

This will have an effect depending on the suite of the card: &#10;-   Brothers: Draw 3 cards and discard any 2 cards from your hand. &#10;-   Villain: Opponent must discard 2 random cards.&#10;-   Location: Look at an opponent&rsquo;s hand. Draw 1 card from the deck. &#10;-   Alchemy: Cannot be discarded in action phase.  However,  &#10;extra Alchemy cards count as wild cards in meld phase. &#10;-   Friend: Draw top 2 cards of the deck and put them in your hand. &#10;-   Plot: Steal 1 random card from an opponent&rsquo;s hand. &#10;-   Theme: Take 1 target card from the discard and put it in your hand.&#10;&#10;3. Meld Phase&#10;If possible, you may make a Meld. There are 4 types of meld:&#10;-   7 cards, one from each of the 7 suites  &#10;-   7 cards all from the same suite&#10;-   7 cards in consecutive Rank Order&#10;-   7 cards of the same rank (This is very difficult and consequently automatically wins the game)  &#10;Immediately discard the Meld after you reveal it, then draw 5 new cards.&#10;&#10;4. End Phase&#10;Max hand size is 9 cards. Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to make 5 melds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fans of science fiction, fantasy, and many other genres are constantly debating what's in the canon and what isn't. Are the prequels? The spin-offs? The Christmas or other holiday special? The animated series? The musical episode? Fan fiction? The special edition or director's cut? Those questions have been turned into a game that's fun to play.&#10;&#10;The goal is to work collaboratively and competitively to get your own personal canon of up to seven cards to match the central canon, which everyone creates together, as closely as possible.&#10;&#10;Each person begins with a hand of five cards. There is a draw pile face down, seven spaces in the center for the collaboratively-determined canon (to and from which any player may place or take cards), seven spaces in front of you for your own canon, and a spot for a discard pile where cards are placed face up. The draw pile and discard pile should be oriented the opposite way from the seven canon slots, so that they are not confused with one another.&#10;You can place a card from your hand onto an identical card either in the central canon or your own personal canon.&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one player has cards remaining, and makes one final move. Any additional cards that player has then go on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;One&rsquo;s score at the end of play is determined by:&#10;1) Multiplying each card in one&rsquo;s personal canon by each matching card in the central canon, and&#10;2) Subtracting one point for each individual card in one&rsquo;s own canon that does not have an equivalent in the central canon.&#10;&#10;Note that there is no penalty related to cards still in your hand if you are the last player holding cards. These are simply discarded. Only what is in your canon determines your score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(From the introduction in the rules)&#10;You were all looking forward to your class trip. You'd spent so much time raising money so you'd be able to afford a trip to a tropical island. However, on the boat ride out you are all gassed. When you wake up some anonymous men instruct you that you will compete in a Battle Royal, where only the sole survivor will be allowed to leave the island. One by one, you get to pick up a back pack with one random item within, and leave and set out on the island. What terror!&#10;How will you survive this terrible ordeal? You open up your bag, your stomach churns at the sight of what's inside. How will you be able to survive, knowing your neither the strongest nor the smartest in the class...&#10;&#10;Team Kill is a social party game of negotiation, bluffing and tactics loosely based on the Japanese movie [i]Battle Royal[/i]. At the start of the game each player is dealt one card with a printed value on it (from 0 to 32). Players take turns interacting in &quot;confrontations&quot;, i.e. making a fist and simultaneously making a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Thumbs down will result in a violent confrontation where the players try to kill each other by comparing cards, eliminating the player with the lower value. Thumbs up will let players form teams, whose card values are then summed in later confrontations. Often though, one player will do a thumbs-up, while the other will do a thumbs-down. In those cases, the teaming player is instantly &quot;team killed&quot;.&#10;&#10;There are only 36 cards in the game, ranging from the weak Teddy Bear, Canned Food and Ornate Fan, to the very powerful Sub Machine Gun, Automatic Rifle and Bazooka. Needless to say, the more powerful cards usually come with better odds for winning. However, the more powerful cards require the player to make a sound like &quot;bang&quot;, &quot;ra-ta-ta-tat&quot;, or &quot;kah-boom&quot; when using them, thus signaling to the rest of the players that trouble is coming.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to become the last man/woman standing in this death match on the tropical island. However, in certain circumstances two players can win together by forming a final bond of trust.&#10;&#10;",

Each starship is stacked with 4 fighter units.&#10;&#10;Both sides have their own unique deck of cards. Cards are of 4 types:  move, attack, defence and special.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn having two phases:&#10;&#10;1.

The numbers on attack cards indicate the exact range of the attack. The numbers on move cards indicate the exact distance the Unit Moves. Defence cards are used in response to an attack to negate it. &#10;     If 2 or more units occupy the same space then a single move card can be used to move them all, however, they must all be moved together to the same destination. Movement is orthogonal or diagonal.&#10;     A fighter can move twice but attack only once in a turn. &#10;     A starship can move only once, but may attack twice in a turn. &#10;&#10;&#10;When an attack by a Human unit hits, all enemy units in the space are hit. Any Formic unit hit is destroyed unless a defence card is played.&#10;&#10;When a Formic attack hits, only one unit is hit. A Human unit that is hit takes 1 point of damage. Starships or fighter squads with 4 or more damage are destroyed.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by destroying your opponent&rsquo;s fleet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game for 2 players with a Biblical Theme. One player is David, the other is Goliath. The aim of the game is to smite your foe.&#10;&#10;The game area is a regular 8 X 8 grid.  There are 2 rock tokens and 2 tree tokens placed randomly on the board.  Figures are used to represent David and Goliath and start on opposite back rows of the board. Figures cannot move into or through rock tokens, but they can sling or throw through them. Figures cannot move or attack into or through Tree Tokens.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck. Some cards can be used by both players, others by David or Goliath, only. Cards allow players to move, attack or defend, or may be an event.&#10;&#10;Each player draws a hand of 7 cards. Goliath gets 1 spear token. David gets 5 stone tokens.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 7 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw Phase&#10;         Each player draws 1 card from the deck and adds it to their hand. &#10;    &#10;     Event Phase&#10;         Each player may play one event card in this phase. Events are resolved immediately.&#10;    &#10;     Goliath Move Phase&#10;         The Goliath player may move his figure on the board.&#10;         Discard a move card to move exactly the indicated number of spaces. Cards will indicate if the move can be orthogonal, diagonal, or both. &#10;         The David player may discard a negate card to end a move at any point  during its progression. &#10;         Goliath cannot move into or through the space occupied by David. &#10;    &#10;     David Move Phase&#10;         The David player may move his figure on the board (using the same rules as applied to Goliath) &#10;    &#10;     Goliath Attack Phase&#10;         The Goliath player may make a spear attack or a sword attack.  The Goliath player starts play in possession of a spear. As long as the Goliath player has his Spear he must make a Spear attack. &#10;         To make a sword attack discard a sword card to attack David if he is in an adjacent space. The card will indicate if the sword attack is orthogonal or diagonal.  The sword attack will be one of three types: Thrust, Slash, or Chop.  The David player may discard a defence card to block a sword attack. Some defence cards will not work against a certain type of sword attack. If a defence card is not successfully played, David is wounded. &#10;         To make a spear attack, the Goliath player must discard a sword card or a throw card. If a sword card is used, the attack is treated exactly like a thrust sword attack (even if the card says Slash or Cut). If a throw card is used the spear will hit exactly at the range indicated on the card. &#10;         Once thrown, if the Spear misses (a defence card is successfully played) place the spear token in the space occupied by David. Goliath is then without his spear. He can retrieve it simply by entering the space where it landed. If a defence card is not successfully played, David is wounded. &#10;    &#10;     David Attack Phase&#10;         David may only make a Sling Stone Attack. To do so both a sling card, and a stone card must be discarded. The sling card determines the range. and can be used for orthogonal or diagonal attacks. The stone card is of 3 types: Fast, Curved, and Sinker.&#10;         The Goliath player may discard a defence card to block a sling attack. Some defence cards will not work against a certain type of sling attack. If a defence card is not successfully played, Goliath is wounded. &#10;         Once slung, if a stone misses (a defence card is successfully played) place a stone token in the space occupied by Goliath. David can retrieve it simply by entering the space where it landed. &#10;    &#10;     End Phase&#10;         Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Players share a common set of 4 wound tokens. For each wound your max hand size is decreased by one. Three wounds is death. The game end when one player kills the other.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introduction&#10;Welcome to Utopia, where sunlight dances to the tune of endless monotony, stories start with happily ever after, and your least favorite person never stubs their toe. Everything not good has been eliminated and forgotten by all. Life is perfect. . . or so we thought. Allow me to explain.&#10;&#10;Not long ago, an unkindness of mythical storytelling ravens appeared out of nowhere. It sounds improbable, but even more so were the stories they told. They sang of villains, love triangles, and everyday town gossip. These formerly inconceivable topics were the first seeds of not good to return to the world. They revived our long-lost palate for contrast and opposition.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, instead of a new age of excitement, we are now in total boredom. No scholar can explain it. The ravens&rsquo; stories imply good is not good enough. So is perfection a lie? Is there a better half to good? For now, we call it EvL. And since we are lacking in this art, we formed a team to find the experts.&#10;&#10;As a new member of Team EvL, your first order of business is to summon the demons to save the world. Go forth and complete the rituals before you. Your demons are waiting.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Team Evl is an UN-cooperative card game where deception, deduction and risk taking are key. Join your friends to cure boredom, and release EvL back into the world. CAUTION: As you play, the Seeds of EvL destroy your once noble thoughts. Lie and bluff your way to victory by summoning the demons all for yourself.&#10;&#10;With only one action per turn (Play, Peek, Draw, &hellip;), you must manipulate the state of a ritual circle in an effort to control the most information on the board. All cards are played face down, so carefully observe your opponent&rsquo;s expressions and moves. When you believe the ritual to be in its correct state, declare it complete! If you are right, the demon is yours and you win the round! Collect 3 demons to win the game.&#10;&#10;Team Evl is designed and illustrated by Ethan Weber.&#10;2-5 players&#10;30-60min for veteran players. Playtime increases with the number of players, but feel free to shorten the game by requiring fewer demons to win.&#10;&#10;",

Depos are placed around a dodecagon shaped board. Each turn a player picks up cards that determine the starting location and destination of cargo. Then they place a terrain tile to help them traverse the board or stop others, before moving their vehicles.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to earn 10 victory points. Cargo comes in multiple types, each with its own monetary and VP value. Strategy comes in deciding which vehicle to use considering terrain, resources on the board and other players actions. Action cards further modify the gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Apochalyptica is an advanced board game for 4-8 players based around a group of people that find themselves facing nuclear war in the late 1940s. WWII has just ended, but any celebration to be had is cut short by news of bombs falling worldwide, with more headed their way. This ragtag group must gather as many supplies as they can before locking themselves away in a bunker for twelve months. During this time, they will have to deal with a number of trials from petty arguments among themselves, to food, water, and oxygen running out; all with the threat of fallout exposure looming around every corner.&#10;&#10;The game is board-and-card based, but plays like your average tabletop rpg. Players have the opportunity to roleplay as their characters, dealing with interpersonal relationships within the bunker as you wait for the timer to tick down and free you. Each character has their own unique set of skills and traits to bring to the table, and players must decide how to best use them to ensure the survival of the group.&#10;&#10;The first section is the gathering section. Based on the chosen level of gameplay difficulty (easy or normal. Hard doesn't have a gather section and instead starts directly in the bunker with a set amount of supplies) players will travel around the board to &quot;locations&quot; to search for supplies. To search, they roll 1d10 and compare it to a table of outcomes.&#10;At the end of three rounds, they enter a &quot;voting&quot; phase to choose which characters enter the bunker with their supplies, and which must be left outside.&#10;&#10;Section two, the &quot;main game&quot;, is twelve rounds in the Bunker where the surviving characters must monitor the levels of food, water, and oxygen. All while trying to keep their sanity levels intact so they don't end up killing each other, or themselves. They have ways of slowing the drop of each of these supply levels, including farming, building a water purification system, monitoring a radio for information about the outside, and interacting with one another in positive ways. Each round, however, players must roll to determine events that occur on their turns that could either help or hinder their progress. It could be something as little as having a bad day and losing a few extra sanity points, to something as disastrous as a radiation leak that permanently seals off a section of the bunker from use.&#10;&#10;",

A limited amount of decks printed in professional-grade quality was sold on Christmas 2016.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to draw cards from a pile and avoid cards labeled with an evil, mutant ape by neutralizing them with a &quot;battle&quot; card. If an ape card cannot be neutralized, the player looses. The number of battle cards in the game decreases over time. The last player still standing wins.&#10;&#10;Additional action cards can give an individual player and advantage over others, for example:&#10;&#10;- The &quot;future zombie&quot; card allows a player to look at and reshuffle the top three cards of the drawing pile.&#10;&#10;- The &quot;fight&quot; card allows a player to challenge an other player to a side competition (e.g. arm wrestling, throwing darts, drinking etc.). The winner may then take one of the loosers' cards.&#10;&#10;- The &quot;downfall&quot; card moves all &quot;ape&quot; cards in the game to the top of the drawing pile.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two to five players, but is most fun with four or five players.&#10;&#10;",

Note: the game is not published in English, so only the JP title is being used.&#10;&#10;Hedgehogs Makoto and Yurayura have both fallen in love with Princess Harine. Now they are rivals in love as they vie for the Princess&rsquo;s affection. Each hedgehog plans his itinerary for the day in order to collect as many hearts as possible &mdash; either by sending a love letter to the Princess or, oppositely, throwing poop at his rival hedgehog. The hedgehog with the most hearts at the end wins the Princess&rsquo;s heart.&#10;&#10;This 2 player game consists of plotting action cards. When all actions cards have been plotted, they will be carried out in the specific order of how they were plotted. However, your rival&rsquo;s cards are also included amongst the cards you can plot. Try to collect as many heart tokens as you can with your actions, but if you collect three poop tokens, you will lose instantly.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

Gameplay is language free, so whilst the game is published in Japanese, English rules are available online.&#10;&#10;In the region where the God Hermes reigns, all fruits produced must be offered to him. Hermes is a god of trade, he determines the true owner of the fruits&#10;by trading. The fruits are first offered to Hermes (placed on the table), then auctioned off by the true owner.&#10;&#10;Players have their own deck of cards which represent the fruits produced in Hermes's region. Each turn, you may draw a card from your deck and either offer it to Hermes, placing it onto the table, or keep it as your bidding resource. When you feel the time is ripe, you may instead initiate an auction for all fruits on the table.&#10;&#10;In the end, the victory goes to the player who has the greatest total value of fruits.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#229;&#159;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#142;&#161;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#148;&#163;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#141;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#230;&#141;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#231;&#148;&#163;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#141;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#148;&#163;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#229;&#132;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#229;&#132;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#229;&#159;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#142;&#161;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#141;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#141;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#190;&#161;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A dark curse has fallen over the Kingdom of Sugarplum, and the Frosted Throne sits empty.  As a Dream Mage with incredible powers and powerful ambitions you must set out on a journey across the four realms to take the crown for yourself.&#10;&#10;But it will not be easy.&#10;&#10;Enemies and Encounters will test you along the Candy Road, dangerous Nightmares haunt your quest, other Dream Mages will do their best to sabotage your endeavor, and even if you do take the crown for yourself, you will have to fight to keep it.&#10;&#10;Sugarplum Chronicles is a candy-themed adventure game in which the first goal is to make it to the Crown Tile before any other players.  The second, and final, goal is to be the last surviving Player.  During their turn, players will first roll to move, and decide which direction they want to move in and whether or not they want to stop at Candy Shops or Landmarks along the way.  Depending on the color of the tile that Players land on, they will either face an enemy or encounter (red), draw a nightmare or dream card (black), receive a Lemon Drop treasure (yellow), explore a Landmark (purple), or have a rest (green).&#10;&#10;The first Player to reach the crown tile will then hunt down the other players and face off in D-20 based combat featuring edible weapons and items.&#10;&#10;Sugarplum Chronicles includes over 45 unique enemies, 'edible' weapons and items, an exciting PVP endgame, and player interaction through spells, mercenaries, magic teddy bears, and more.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;IntroductionYugo is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board.&#10;&#10;Each player must have access to a sufficient number of pieces of their own color. There are two types of pieces: pawns and kings. There's also one special token called button.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA player's group is a set of one or more orthogonally contiguous pieces of that player's color. Pawns and kings can be part of the same group. A portion of a larger group is not a group.&#10;&#10;A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to that group. A group without liberties is said to be surrounded.&#10;&#10;A territory is a set of orthogonally contiguous empty points. A portion of a larger territory is not a territory. You own a territory if at least one point in it is adjacent to one of your pieces and no points in it are adjacent to any enemy pieces.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must perform exactly one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;a) Take the button, provided that none of the players has taken it before.&#10;&#10;b) Pass, provided that the button is already taken.&#10;&#10;c) Place a pawn of their color on an empty point such that the number of surrounded groups remains unchanged.&#10;&#10;d) Place a king of their color on an empty point such that the number of surrounded enemy groups is increased, and remove all pawns from all such groups. In the resulting position, if there are any surrounded friendly groups, remove all pawns from them as well.&#10;&#10;Play stops when both players pass consecutively. At this point, the players may agree which groups, if any, can be removed from the board without changing the scores that would result from continuing the game. If there is such an agreement, the agreed groups are removed, the game ends and the resulting position is used for scoring. If the players don't agree which groups should be removed, play is resumed. In this case, when both players pass consecutively again, the game ends and the current position, without further removals, is used for scoring.&#10;&#10;A player's score is the number of empty points in their territories, plus the number of pieces of their color in groups with one or more liberties, plus the number of enemy kings in groups without liberties, plus half a point if they have taken the button, plus the value of komi (see below) in the case of White.&#10;&#10;The player with the higher score wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;KomiThe komi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesYugo is a Go variant inspired by Mark Steere's Redstone.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     igGameCenter (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But now that he&rsquo;s here, now that he has no option but to swing his sword around rather than swinging around bales of hay, well, he&rsquo;s going to be the best zombie-slayer there is. Maybe win himself a princess in the process, a small castle&hellip; There&rsquo;s something to be said for being a hero, Troy is discovering, especially when it comes with lovely wenches and pocketfuls of gold. Of course, he has to survive all the zombies first.&#10;&#10;Evil Troy&#10;The necromancers have performed many experiments in their quest for the perfect evil, the perfect zombie. One of the worst things they managed was a simulacrum of a living being. This golem remembers everything the original human, Troy, knew; he has all of Troy&rsquo;s skills. But he is as undead as a zombie, as angry as a raging bull, and as absolutely evil as it is possible to be. Evil Troy is a nasty piece of work, to put it shortly, intent on killing anything &ndash; human, zombie, or necromancer &ndash; that gets in his way.&#10;&#10;",

The game was released for the Game Market 2017 Kobe in Japan.&#10;&#10;In this game, you play students about to graduate from high school. They have little time before their graduation to get ready a photo album with memories of their days as student friends.&#10;&#10;A tabletop game where your objective is to collect photos of your youth life and create your student yearbook. Gameplay itself is simple: draw a photo, and mount them on the board. Though, each player character has hidden objectives (like which kind of photo they like, or who they are in love with), and since so, their interests should have some conflicts.&#10;&#10;There are no special events in the game, but with many beautiful photos in a common Japanese school days settings, the nostalgic atmosphere should be appealing to many.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;You play as one of eight character, and each character has hidden objectives. The deck of photos is like printed photos shot on film, not digital prints. Each turn, you may 'shoot a photo' (draw a photo from the deck and place it face down in front of you), 'develop/print' (turn one of your face-down photos face-up), or 'layout on board' (place your printed photo on the shared album board).&#10;&#10;The board doesn't have a grid, you may place the photo anyway you like. You may overlap any previously placed photos with just one restriction: at least one character's face must be fully visible from the underlying photos.&#10;&#10;When the 'endgame' photo is drawn (it is loaded somewhere near the bottom of the deck), you tally points based on your hidden objectives.&#10;&#10;The gameplay itself has low language dependencies, but the 8 student ID cards (with the face of the character and their hidden objectives) have Japanese on them. The photo itself has some handwritten Japanese scribbles with their character names, and some objectives refer to the other characters by these names (&quot;4pts: have 2 or more photos with Miki at the end&quot;). Therefore, if you cannot read JP letters well, you might struggle to properly recognise the names as they are presented. So the game needs a little more than a crib-sheet or memory, you need to be able to spot these names easily.&#10;&#10;Publisher

    "Description": "A card and board game for 2-6 players in which each player takes the role of a Demon Hunter.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts Europe in the late 1800s. 20 cities are marked on the board, with each city connected to 1-4 other nearby cities.  Some cities may have an effect on die rolls or creature capabilities.&#10;&#10;There are 3 decks: &#10;-   The Character Deck represents advantageous traits that the characters start the game with.&#10;The Research Deck comprises cards aid that aid the Demon Hunters in their quest. Players acquire these during play. Card types include: Events, Spells, Weapons, Armour, Items, and Companions. &#10;-   The Creature Deck need to be small to fit easily on the map and represent the creatures that can be found in the various cities. Creatures have a strength and a victory point score (earned by defeating them)&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 Hits. Each player draws and keeps 5 character cards.  Each player rolls 1D20 to determine their starting City. &#10;Randomly distribute the X top cards of the creature deck to random cities, where X = the number of players. (Max Monsters in any one city at start is 2)&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn having 4 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Destiny Phase&#10;-   The current player draws the top research card from the deck and places it in his hand.&#10;&#10;2.  Evil Phase&#10;-   For each player roll 1D6: on a roll of 4+ flip over the top card of the creature deck and for each new creature roll 1D20.  Place the creature on the indicated City.&#10;&#10;3.  Action Phase&#10;-   The Current player may take 2 actions. There are 6 possible actions: &#10;1.  Rest Action - Roll on a healing table to heal any hit points lost.&#10;2.  Travel Action &ndash; Roll on a movement table to move 0-2 spaces.&#10;3.  Search Action &ndash; Roll on a search table to determine whether you can find a creature to fight.&#10;4.  Recruit Action - Put one Weapon, Item, Armour, or Companion card into play. A character can only have a maximum of 1 armour card, 2 weapon cards and 2 companion cards in Play&#10;5.  Research Action - Roll on a research table and draw 0-3 research cards from the deck and put them in your hand. (You may do a max of 1 research action per turn)&#10;6.  Trade Action - If you are in the same city as 1 or more other Demon Hunters, you may trade resource cards, in hand or in play.&#10;&#10;4.  Fate Phase &#10;-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess. &#10;-   If at the end of a turn, any city has 5 or more creatures, it is &#10;overrun and all players lose.&#10;&#10;When fighting creatures roll 1D20 (The Battle Roll) and add any force bonuses you might have. If this number is equal to or greater than the strength of the creature you defeat it. Place defeated creatures in your victory pile. &#10;If your modified roll was less, the creature remains in play and roll on the Wound Table taking damage accordingly. If you are reduced to zero Hits skip your next turn and return to play with just 1 hit. &#10;If after losing a battle roll, you still have hits you may decide to either &#10;continue the combat or flee. If you decide to continue, make another battle roll against the same creature. If you decide to flee, you may stay in the city or move 1 space.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the turn the creature deck has been exhausted. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
