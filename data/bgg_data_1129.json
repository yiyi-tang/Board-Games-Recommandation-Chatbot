    "Description": "Grikk the Gremlin is a promotional Character card for Witchful Thinking.&#10;&#10;Grikk's first Character Ability, Mischievous, represents every gremlin's instinct of ruining peoples lives and sabotaging their dreams. This Character Ability allows Grikk to force a witch to swap 1 Potion card of his choice with him or another witch when he plays a Sneaky Witch card. In Witchful Thinking, the winner of the game is the player who has collected the most Potion cards. If there is a tie, all tied players must add their own Potion cards together, and whoever has the greatest value wins. This means that players want Potion cards with positive numbers instead of negative numbers to ensure their own victory. So for example, if a witch has the Elixir of Life which has a value of +18, Grikk can use his Character Ability to take that valuable card away and give it to another witch instead, or he can take it for himself.&#10;&#10;Grikk's second Character Ability, Trickster, represents every gremlin's desire to play tricks on others. This Character Ability allows Grikk to force a witch to swap their entire hand of Ingredient cards with another witch or himself when he plays a Sneaky Witch card. Forcing other players to swap their cards with each other can be a useful tactic because you can interrupt what the players were planning to do next. Alternatively, Grikk can use this Character Ability to get new cards if his own cards are no good.&#10;&#10;",

P. Lovecraft&#10;&#10;Bubastis is probably the weirdest faction of them all. It doesn&rsquo;t have any cultists. It doesn&rsquo;t have a Great Old One. It does have Bastet, an Elder God (not quite the same). Like other factions it has 6 spellbooks that are gained in the normal way (though of course with her own unique requirements). One of her most unusual features is that it has a separate map tile representing the Moon. This Moon is the Bubastis starting area. It counts as a Bubastis-controlled gate for all purposes, except that it can&rsquo;t be seized by another faction. No other gate can be built or moved there (except Yog-Sothoth via the Catnapping spellbook). Bubastis units can move and be pained freely between the Moon and any other map area. Other factions can move or be pained from the Moon to the main map area, but they can&rsquo;t move to the Moon on their own. Since your cats can&rsquo;t build or occupy gates, the Moon is their only gate throughout the game.&#10;&#10;If they don&rsquo;t have Cultists, then &hellip; ?&#10;&#10;Yes I know, this leads into a lot of questions. Let&rsquo;s break it down. Your faction has 6 Earth cats, 2 Cats from Mars, 2 Cats from Saturn, 2 Cats from Uranus, and Bastet. All the cats count as monsters (yes even the Earth cats), and all the cats generate 1 Power during the Gather Power phase. At game start, you have 6 Earth cats on the Moon, plus the Moon counts as your Gate. This gives you a total of 8 Power: 1 per cat and 2 for the Moon. To get more Power, you&rsquo;ll have to use a certain spellbook, fulfill a certain spellbook requirement, or summon more cats.&#10;&#10;Your Earth cats have the special ability that spellbooks and abilities that target cultists can target Earth cats as if they were acolytes. The Earth cats still cannot be captured, though (except by Tsathoggua using Capture Monster). This does mean that Zingaya will turn them into undead, Ghroth kidnaps them, if you summon a Satyr it brings a pet cat, etc. You can even turn Earth cats into Brain Cylinders.&#10;&#10;The Earth Cats are Combat 0, Cost 1. &#10;Cats from Mars are Combat 1, Cost 2. &#10;Cats from Saturn are Combat 2, Cost 3&#10;Cats from Uranus are Combat 3, Cost 4.&#10;&#10;Each cat gets a special spellbook benefiting it in some way. The Earth cat&rsquo;s spellbook, Catabolism, lets an Earth cat recruit a monster without a gate, letting you bring them forth on the main map. The Cats from Mars spellbook, Zagazig, reverses the results of Kills and Pains, so all rolled Kills become Pains, and all rolled Pains become Kills. This works on both sides in the battle, so beware. The Cats from Saturn have a spellbook letting them spend 1 Power pre-battle to increase their attack up to 6. And the Cats from Uranus spellbook means that you can kill one extra unit anywhere on the map post-battle.&#10;&#10;How can they win, without Gates?&#10;&#10;Well, one of their spellbooks, Ailurophobia, lets them score 1 Doom per cat variety that they have on the main map. So if they have all four (which is usually the case), they get 5 Doom per Doom phase: 4 for the cats, and 1 for their impregnable Moon Gate. That&rsquo;s not bad. On the other hand, their Rituals of Annihilation are sucktastic, since all that does is double their Gate points, a mere +1.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s Bastet like?&#10;&#10;She&rsquo;s an Elder God (like Nodens), not a Great Old One. This means she does not roll combat dice, and she does not inherently provide an Elder Sign when you Ritual.&#10;&#10;However, her Combat ability is still potent: she adds 1 Kill to your combat total, and additionally the enemy must lower their rolled Kill total by 1.&#10;&#10;Her Requires Attention ability kicks in during the Doom phase. If Bastet is in an area with an enemy cultist (only), you can perform a Ritual of Annihilation. In this case, the Ritual adds exactly 4 Doom, plus if the area Bastet is in has an enemy Gate, gain 1 Elder Sign, and if the Area has an Enemy Great Old One, 2 more Elder Signs. These are additive.&#10;&#10;This means your best-case scenario is you have all four cat types on the map, plus Bastet in an area with an enemy-controlled Gate and their Great Old One. In the Doom phase you will earn 5 Doom for your 4 cats &amp; Moon gate. Then the ritual scores you 4 more Doom and Bastet scores 3 Elder Signs. That&rsquo;s 9 Doom and 3 Elder Signs. Of course you won&rsquo;t be able to pull that off every turn.&#10;&#10;The cats are fun, if weird, and I think you&rsquo;ll like playing with them. We have had a lot of fun. They are an extremely aggressive faction. They don&rsquo;t play &ldquo;defense&rdquo; because they want to always be in your areas causing trouble. Like kittens I guess. And Bubastis is hard to KO, because you can&rsquo;t steal her gate. You have to just kill the kitties one by one.&#10;&#10;Giant Blind Albino Penguins!&#10;&#10;This white, waddling thing was fully six feet high&hellip; To say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an instant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others. Then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguin&mdash;albeit of a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessness.&#10;&#10;- H. P. Lovecraft&#10;&#10;The Giant Blind Albino Penguin has been a thorn in my side for years. People are constantly asking for one, yet it&rsquo;s obviously idiotic. Yes, it&rsquo;s a Lovecraft creation, but it&rsquo;s specifically non-threatening. That said, so many folks have asked for this critter that I have finally caved in. Here it is.&#10;&#10;And it&rsquo;s a doozy. As with the cats, I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to make them look goofy. They are creepy and terrifying. At least in my opinion.&#10;&#10;What do they do?&#10;Their sole purpose is to mess with the other players and make them hate you. Which really ought to be the obvious desire of anyone spending Doom to get giant penguins! As with other neutral monsters you pay 2 Doom in the Doom phase, then get a free Penguin at your gate. The Penguins are cost 1, Combat minus 2. This means if you have a Penguin in the battle it reduces your attack by 2, so it&rsquo;s kind of like the irksome Servitors of the Outer Gods. But it is indeed tactically and strategically quite different.&#10;&#10;The Penguins&rsquo; special ability is Laughingstock, and is pre-Battle. You can move one or more Penguins to a Battle area even if you are not involved in the Battle. If you are part of the Battle, the Penguin fights on your side&ndash;so in this case it acts kind of like a Hunting Horror with Search &amp; Destroy, except that it weakens your combat. But it does serve as a meat shield, which provides some usefulness. I have seen a Crawling Chaos fly in a pair of Penguins to accompany Nyarlathotep in a battle&ndash;sure it lowered Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s attack from 12 to 8, but 8 dice was enough for his purposes, and having two Cost 1 penguins there to take hits for him was priceless.&#10;&#10;Their real threat though is if you are not involved in the battle, then you choose which side the Penguin is on, and it belongs to that player till the battle ends. In other words, they roll 2 fewer dice, and you are the reason. If they complain, tell them that your regime is &ldquo;harsh, but fair.&rdquo; Or try to convince them that you were &ldquo;helping&rdquo; by giving them an ally. The latter has never worked for me though.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of the game is to satisfy the nine fundamental human needs &ndash; subsistence, protection affection, understanding, participation, leisure, creation, identity and freedom &ndash; through the wings that we collect on our journey. There are 72 cards, of which 12 are surprise cards. These can be pleasant or unpleasant, as happens in daily life. The key to the game lies within the cards.  In the first actions they reflect our feelings, thoughts and actions. To bet or not to bet, that is the question. Therefore, we must bet, or not, on how much of our life, &lsquo;cronos&rsquo;, we are willing to risk.  20 &lsquo;cronos&rsquo; coins are allocated to each player.  As the game unfolds we find &lsquo;wings&rsquo;, that satisfy our needs, or &lsquo;weights&rsquo;, that drag us down and away from them.  We also see through our decisions that the &lsquo;suns&rsquo; we contribute to the common good begin to shine, and by contrast, the &lsquo;poisons&rsquo; of our bad choices begin to erode life.  And for that life to continue, if there are poisons in the common good the game cannot be won, even if the nine needs are satisfied. So, the underlying philosophy is that winning is about not harming others: live and let live.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Game features role-playing elements and the concept of levelling up too.&#10;&#10;Each player begins by choosing the shadowcaster they wish to play as, which each comes with its own choice of cards and decks to use, along with certain special abilities. Players also choose a shadow card which gives them further abilities that stat with them throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns in playing the cards (spells, creatures or forms of energy) in their hands that they can or adding new cards to their hands. The game gets deeply strategic in that players can also level up giving them access to more powerful abilities and additional shadow cards. The risk being that a player remains vulnerable for an entire round to do so.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to be the last shadowcaster on the board. The game can be played individually with others or in teams.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;La Grande Arm&ecirc;e: Napoleonic Warfare at Divisional Level 1800 - 1815&quot; is a set of miniatures wargame rules designed for full army engagements between the French and Allied forces of the Napoleonic period. Armies are subdivided into Corps, with the Corp Commander giving orders to elements of Brigade or Divisional size for cavalry and elements of Divisional size for infantry and the artillery reserves.&#10;&#10;The bound sequence is based around Corp command actions that allow the individual elements to execute actions, whilst opposing elements may react to these actions. Has the battle progresses the elements will start to become disrupted and will obtain a number of disruption markers. This disruption will hinder the elements in their actions and give advantage to elements that are less disrupted.&#10;&#10;These Napoleonic rules are designed to give a generic battle with little or no detail below Divisional level. Troop classes are subdivided into infantry, cavalry and artillery, whilst troop class are split into guard, seasoned and garrison. As with most of our rules we have tried to make the rules fun, but still maintaining the realistic feel of the period... so enjoy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The circus is a nasty business. There are people to pay, animals to take care of, messes to clean, accidents to fix... and that's before you've even put on the show!&#10;&#10;9-Card Circus is an in-hand resource management game for 1 player. Over the course of 4 years, you will work to make the best circus you can by rotating, flipping, and re-arranging cards. If you're careless, however, you'll be forced to start over from scratch, as your reckless management draws public ire and government regulations.&#10;&#10;Every decision has consequences, and you'll need to think multiple turns ahead to ensure success. With deep, interesting mechanics, a lack of reliance on memory, and a small footprint, 9-Card Circus is a game you can take and play anywhere.&#10;&#10;9-Card Circus also has a series of campaign challenges, which each modify a rule of the game and force you to change your strategy in order to succeed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Pickets, fines, taxes, protests, corralitos, looting, devaluations and other endless problems will be presented to you every day. But now let's talk about the game ... Well, it's similar, only much more fun and it will also help you see reality in a different way. To achieve your mission you have 5,000 pesos in your pocket, 5 cards and a chain of businesses ready to open.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must choose one of the following options:&#10;a) Advance, as many boxes as the dice indicate.&#10;b) Charge, the State will pay you 100 times what the dice say (and well, it's a game!).&#10;c) Draw a card.&#10;&#10;There are three kinds of cards: problems, solutions and bonds. With the problems, you can stop the other players by devaluating them, fining them, looting them or corralling their money. With the solutions, you can solve the problems that your competitors threw at you (but unfortunately these solutions only work in the game). With the bonds (and this may be strange for everyone) you can take advantage of their value and exchange them with the state for money.&#10;&#10;On your way to the end of the year, you will land on empty lots where you can put your business, listen to the National Chain, collect privilege pensions, pay extraordinary taxes, sell pots and many other things that will make you think that you have always been a great player of this game and that nobody else will be able to win.&#10;&#10;This game references the 1998-2002 Argentine Great Depression.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the translated&#10;&#10;Su objetivo es llegar a fin de a&ntilde;o, claro que esto no es tarea f&aacute;cil.
