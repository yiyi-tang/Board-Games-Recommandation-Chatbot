    "Description": "China, LLC. is a game of China from the establishment of the Qing Dynasty in 1644 CE to the end of the Chinese Civil War of 1949 CE. Philip Jelley uses the same system as the popular Rome, Inc. in which you run China like a business, expanding its corporate power across China, Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet and the Southern and Eastern Seas until it becomes the largest, richest, most populous entity in the world. From the height of power, the Qing CEOs became increasingly detached from reality, confined to their palaces, and dominated by managerial eunuchs while their vast empire is beset by internal rebellions and new barbarians from across the far seas. Can you succeed where they failed? Even if Qing fall, you have a second chance as the Guomindang (Chinese Nationalist Party) struggle to bring order out of the chaos of a crumbling empire.&#10;&#10;Statesmen may become emperors, governors, rebels, and enemy leaders and are rated for their Military, Administration, Popularity, and Intrigue abilities. Each has a special ability, allowing them to defeat their historic foes, assassinate rivals, and influence foreign affairs. For example, the Emperor Qianlong has two Military, five Administration, two Popularity, and four Intrigue abilities, and the Conquest special ability, making him an indifferent general, but excellent bureaucrat even if he was reluctant to embrace popular reform, who expanded the Qing Empire to its greatest extent. Less useful is the Empress Cixi with one Military, two Administration, two Popularity, and four Intrigue abilities, and the Assassin special ability, whose habit of killing emperors destabilized the Qing Dynasty.&#10;&#10;The map has provinces grouped into ten commands, each with their own governor to collect taxes, crush insurgents, fight wars, or perhaps assassinate the emperor, or launch a rebellion. Victory is determined by annexing provinces, defeating wars, financing massive prestige projects, and establishing the Mandate of Heaven. Cavalry, infantry, and fleets are used to fight wars and garrison provinces, expanding direct control, or creating vassals in outlying provinces. Enemy leaders and wars move from province to province until defeated, encouraging revolts, causing unrest, reducing income, but fighting them could lead to disaster. Unequal Treaties imposed on China by foreign powers robbing her of provinces, prestige, and cash and changing the rules as they expand their own empires.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents 5-10 years, with 10 turns in each scenario. The four scenarios start in 1644 CE, 1735 CE, 1820 CE, and 1889 CE which may be combined into campaign games. You need to blend military acumen with careful administration, as well as intrigue, making the most of what you have each turn, just like any modern-day business. China, LLC will give you a new perception of how war is a cost, business is a benefit, and empire is somewhere in between. It&rsquo;s up to you to find a balance, or heads will roll. China, LLC comes with one full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet, 280 full color 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces and around 12 pages of rules. Players should average from 3 to 4 hours per scenario.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Hiel was disabled after taking fifty or more hits from 8 inch and smaller shells, and finally sunk by air-launched torpedoes. Kirishima was shattered by battleship gunfire, while Kongo was torpedoed by a submarine, and Haruna sunk by an air raid on Kuro.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher's product info card&#10;&#10;",

If the total of the cards in his/her hand is under 7, he/she can call &quot;Miyabi&quot; and challenge to win the round.&#10;     Everyone reveals their hand.&#10;     If the total of the cards in hand is higher than the player who called &quot;Miyabi&quot;, he/she loses and gets the total of the cards in his/her hand as drunkenness points.&#10;     If any player has a total of the cards less than the player who called &quot;Miyabi&quot;, he/she succeeds in &quot;Miyabi-Gasane&quot; and wins. The player who called &quot;Miyabi&quot; will get his/her total of the cards plus 30 drunkenness points.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player reaches 109 drunkenness points or more. A player with the lowest drunkenness point becomes the winner.&#10;&#10;Once you play GA-GA, you will become addicted: The exhilarating feeling of discarding many cards at once while keeping an eye on other players' faces, reading a flow of the game, deep strategic thinking, and so on...  Please enjoy this beautiful and glittering Japanese board game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "LastFairyTale is an asymmetric strategy card game with a concept that grants the wishes of the characters in the fairy tales we saw as children.&#10;&#10;The characters from the Brothers Grimm and Andersen fairy tales we are familiar with each have their own wishes in their story. These wishes were realized as 'victory conditions' for each character.&#10;Each character has their own unique character action to reach the 'victory condition', and it is a game in which the character's actions interfere with the opponent and reach the 'victory condition' first.&#10;&#10;However, in most games with 'various types of characters', the problem of balance is always on the rise. There were always strong characters or cards, and when everyone played with strong characters and cards, the interest in the game would diminish.&#10;&#10;This game is the first board game used to balance the game, introducing AI to play this game in the testing phase.&#10;LastFairyTale's optimized AI based on Hanabi Play artificial intelligence performs test play through an average of 30 million simulations per turn.&#10;After training the AI &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;through these test plays, it goes through millions of battles to find the best play. Through this tests, we can check this character's strengths and weaknesses in advance, and find the best-balanced character action.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each card has charming, custom artwork centered around animals doing the Disco. The game typically plays in 10-15 minutes and has multiple game modes to scale the gameplay in the interest of maintaining that quick-paced play. All modes except the solo mode have a built-in timer made up of cards, called the &quot;song&quot;, that can be claimed for additional points but also shortening the game time.&#10;&#10;The core of the game is centered around matching arrays of icons along the tops and bottoms of the cards to get the most points. It is a simple enough concept to allow younger family members to play, however the ability to continue playing if you set up &quot;perfect matches&quot; allows strategies to pull off crazy and long combinations that will keep more experienced players having fun alongside them. In addition to its quick gameplay, the game lacks a true &quot;fail&quot; condition and players who go out on their turn are turned into audience members with a new set of actions that can still influence the rest of the &quot;dancers&quot; still playing for points.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player must guess their own word, one which an opponent has provided for them. All players play at once - no moderator is required. &#10;    &#10;COMPONENTS &#10;&bull; Dry erase decoding boards  &#10;&bull; Dry erase markers&#10;&bull; Dry erase racks.&#10; OVERVIEW &#10;The goal of WQRDLES is to guess your own secret word - one secretly created by an opponent.  &#10;Each player thinks of a word, writes it down in secret and hides it from an opponent. &#10;All opponents can see all secret words, except their own.&#10;Players write down words to query against their own secret word. Any opponent compares the word against the secret word and encodes an answer in the form of X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s. &#10;&ldquo;X&rdquo; means the letter is in the secret word but in the wrong spot&#10;&ldquo;O&rdquo; means the letter is in the secret word and in the right spot.&#10;     &#10;INITIAL SETUP &#10;1. Give each player a decoding board, a rack and dry erase marker.&#10;2. Each player thinks of a five-letter word and secretly writes it on their rack.&#10;3. Each player passes their rack upside down to the player on their right.&#10;4. Each player carefully flips over their new rack so that it is visible by all players except their self.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY &#10;Players write down a five-letter &ldquo;query&rdquo; word on their decoding board and pass the board to any player to decode.&#10;The receiving player decodes the word against the other player&rsquo;s secret word and returns the board.&#10;The receiving player now examines the result and decides upon the next query word to use.&#10;All players play simultaneously and game play can be quick.&#10;&emsp;&#10;DECODING &amp; MARKING MATCHING LETTERS &#10;Each player will be decoding the query word of an opponent. You must accurately mark each letter of the query word against the letters in the player&rsquo;s secret word.  &#10;Mark an &ldquo;X&rdquo; for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong spot. Fill the square for a letter in the identical position.&#10;&#10;For example, the secret word is HOUSE. &#10;The query word is SHAPE. &#10;Three letters are in common and the &ldquo;E&rdquo; is the only letter in the correct place. Fill in the box for the &ldquo;E&rdquo; and mark the other letters with &ldquo;X&rdquo;. &#10;  &#10;Optionally, indicate that the secret word is lower than SHAPE by marking &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;PLAY IN ROUNDS &#10;At the start of each round, clear your decoding board,  except for your score. Continue with game play as above.&#10;&#10;SCORING &#10;When a player guesses their word, the value in the leftmost box (1-6) is their score for the round. Add that number to the existing score and mark the current score on their decoding board. &#10;  &#10;TRACKING MISSING LETTERS &#10;Mark the A-Z letters at the bottom of your decoding board that you have determining are not in your secret word.&#10;&#10;ENDING THE GAME &#10;The game is over once five rounds have been completed. The player with the highest score is the winner. In the case of a tie, erase your board (except for the score) and play one more round.&#10;&#10;INCORRECT DECODING PENALTY &#10;If a player incorrectly decodes their word, they cannot receive any points for that round. It is very important to be accurate in decoding your opponent&rsquo;s word.&#10;&#10;ALTERNATE WAYS TO PLAY  &#10;1. For an easier game, use four-letter words. &#10;2. Use the &lt; and &gt; markers as additional clues. &#10;&lt; means the secret word is alphabetically lower than the query word (eg BACON &lt;  STRIP), in other words, &ldquo;go lower&rdquo;.&#10;&gt; means the secret word is alphabetically higher than the query word (eg WAGON  &gt; TRAIN ), &ldquo;go higher&rdquo;.&#10;  &#10;STRATEGIES &#10;To narrow down and home in on your secret word, pick query words that alternate the known letters.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "StarForce Commander is a game of tactical starship combat. It uses streamlined and intuitive game mechanics so you can focus on tactical decision-making. You are NOT merely resolving the battle by doing bookkeeping and rolling dice. You have decisions to make, and your decisions matter. There are tactical tradeoffs for every choice. This is an accessible and fun game, whether you are a new cadet or a crusty old spacer. Optional rules let you tailor the complexity to your preferences.&#10;&#10;Check Out our first instructional video on YouTube. THis video covers Basic Maneuvering, or search for &quot;StarForce Commander Mariner Games&quot; to find other videos as we add them.&#10;&#10;https://youtu.be/iT6T6sQeBak&#10;&#10;As the Captain, you decide where the ship&rsquo;s emphasis is; weapons, shields, or maneuvering? You will manage individual ships by allocating energy, arming weapons, maintaining shields, using sensors, and deciding how to outmaneuver your opponent. It sounds like a lot, but most ships have 6-8 points of energy to distribute, so you won&rsquo;t need an accounting staff! Your crew works out details.&#10;&#10;Strike the right balance between weapons, maneuvering, shields, and sensors to gain an advantage on your enemy. Weapons require power and have firing arcs, so you must maneuver to hit the enemy where they are weak. Your ship has four shields protecting all sides, so maneuvering, repairing, and reinforcing weakened shields are vital to survival. Seven turn templates handle maneuvering for 20-60 degree turns depending on your ship&rsquo;s speed and maneuverability.&#10;&#10;Managing a ship is easy enough that with a bit of practice, you can promote yourself to commodore and command 3-4 ships, or even admiral if you want to fight a larger battle. A game takes about 45 minutes per ship on the board, though duels can finish more quickly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A light, tactical abstract game played with stones on the intersections of a triangular grid in the shape of a hexagon. Complexity varies with board size. The goal is to form pairs of stones and keep them from merging.&#10;&#10;The board starts empty, with players alternating in placing a stone of their color onto an empty node of the board.&#10;&#10;When the placement forms a pair, the player chooses a grid direction in which to move the pair, pushing all the stones in front of them one step. However, the move must not cause any of the opponent's stones to be pushed off the board, nor may either stone of the pair, itself, move directly off the board. (Other friendly stones can be pushed off by the move, if desired.) The moving player becomes the leader if, after the push, he now has more pairs of stones than the opponent.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players elect to pass, or when the player who doesn't have the leader's token has no way to form a new pair in the future. Then the leader wins. Playing time is shown for an  order 4 board, which is the smallest playable size.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "115 expansion cards (of all types) created by 20 top webcomics artists, including Jeph Jacques, Zach Weinersmith, Ryan North, Andrew Hussie, Meredith Gran, Dylan Meconis, Jess Fink, R K Milholland, KC Green, R Stevens, and OTHERS!&#10;&#10;Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.&#10;&#10;The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:&#10;&#10;&bull; A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).&#10;&bull; Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.&#10;&bull; Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan.&#10;&bull; The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode.&#10;&bull; The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.&#10;&bull; The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;&#10;&bull; The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.&#10;&#10;Game Modes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.&#10;    Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.&#10;    Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not.&#10;    Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)&#10;    The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hi MiLo! is cooperative trick-taking game for 1 to 5 players where the rules for playing cards and winning tricks changes for each trick based on the unique Hi MiLo! Deck.  Your team strategy will never be the same twice as the Hi MiLo! Deck is shuffled between rounds creating a whole new set of rules for every game!  After seeing their cards, players bid to take the highest, middle, and lowest number of tricks in a round.  Without discussing their cards, players work cooperatively to take tricks which would allow each player to make their bid.  If all players successfully make their bids, the team wins together!&#10;&#10;Cardplay Overview&#10;Hi Milo! is a trick-taking game like Hearts, Spades, or Bridge, and follows many of the same rules as those classic games.  Each player places one card face up on the table and one wins the trick based on the value of the cards.  However, Hi Milo! is unique in that the Hi Milo! Deck determines the rules for which cards you can play and which cards will win any trick.  The Win Card for the trick is collected by the winner of the trick, and the next Win Card determines the rules for the next trick.  The Win Card determines the rules for a trick in two ways.  First, players must play a card of the same suit as the Win Card if possible.  If the Win Card has no suit, players can play any cards and only the number value determines the winner.  Second, the rank of the Win Card determines who wins the trick.  If the Win Card is ranked &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;, the highest value card wins the trick.  If it is &ldquo;Lo&rdquo;, the lowest value card wins the trick.  If it is &ldquo;Mi&rdquo;, the player who played the card in the middle of the highest and lowest cards wins the trick.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You compete with other players to lay the most impressive floor &amp; to score the highest to win.&#10;&#10;All players progressively lay their own floor of 16 tiles in a 4x4 grid in front of them. The floor is built over four rounds. Each round involves each player picking four tiles from a central supply, keeping one they want &amp; passing the remainder clockwise around the table. By drafting one tile from a progressively depleting pile that's passed by each player around the table, you collect four tiles each round. You can temporarily store these tiles while you wait for a better one, or place them on your floor to score points. Tiles placed in the floor are &quot;set in cement&quot; &amp; cannot be changed for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;You can score points by completing motifs, sequences or goals. Scoring is done at the end of each round, so completing motifs, sequences or goals earlier in the game can help you score higher. At the end of the game, you also score for neatness of the floor, so make sure you're tidy while playing!&#10;&#10;The final score is the sum of the scores of the four rounds, plus the end game scoring. The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Not happy with the cards in your hand? Just play a Llama Swap and everyone passes their hand to the left! Sayonara Llamas! Want to cause some drama? Play Drama Llama and choose an opponent to lose their next turn.&#10;&#10;THIS HERD AIN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF US!&#10;&#10;If you want to take a chance at winning, or are desperate to stop one of your fellow ranchers, then it's time for a Duel! Call out an opponent with the Cowboy Llama and duel, Rock/Paper/Scissors style! But duels are risky!

Beware, though! As you thwart characters&rsquo; low-level defenses, you&rsquo;ll strengthen their resolve and drive them to use more powerful weapons against you to protect what few resources they have!&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of turns where you pick a member of your warband to attack an enemy character, with each dealing damage to the other. Stay alert though; it isn&rsquo;t always about having the higher stats! The hardened survivors you battle may enlist their cohorts for powerful combo attacks, pierce your armor for extra damage, lay traps for your characters, or more!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Calendra is a Celtic Themed Runic Card Game designed for 2-4 players. The game comes with: 120 playing cards, 4 seasonal rule cards, an 8 page rule book, and a sturdy cardboard box.&#10;&#10;Players start the game by selecting a random rule card, which determines which suit they will be representing from the playing cards for the duration of the game. The mechanics feature deck-building and quick poker-like rounds of play, where each player puts one card face up on the table per turn in an attempt to form a specific combination of cards. If they form a round winning hand in a combination of suits they win the round, but if they can form a round winning hand using only cards from their own suit (in a flush) then they win the game.&#10;&#10;Warning! Many of the cards allow you to swap cards with other players in the game. As such, the goal of this game is to outwit, trick, and deceive the other players while cleverly assembling a winning hand that cannot be prevented.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
