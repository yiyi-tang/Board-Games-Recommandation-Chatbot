    "Description": "The Earth is probably doomed, and rumors and speculation run rampant. Newspaper headlines from across the globe stir the populace to desperation:&#10;&#10;&quot;MELTING POLAR ICE CAPS&quot; &quot;RISING SEA LEVELS&quot; &quot;POLLUTION!&quot; &quot;OVERPOPULATION!&quot; &quot;NUCLEAR WINTER?&quot; &quot;RAVENOUS BLACK STAR GOATS?&quot; &quot;WILL METEORS STRIKE YOUR CHILDREN?&quot; &quot;DISASTER LOOMS!&quot;&#10;&#10;The race to escape Earth has begun! With the world's nations in decline, powerful corporations now stand as humanity's last hope. Take the reins of one such corporation, as CEO, and venture out into space. With your mission in hand; build ships, collect resources, research technologies, survive the dangers of space exploration, and, while ticket sales hold steady, preserve the human race. Remember to stay a step ahead of competing corporations, which can use slick marketing campaigns and 10 cent tchotchkes to buy the loyalty of the people you just saved from certain doom!&#10;&#10;In Disaster Looms!, players are rewarded points for sticking to the mission and building colonies, and saving colonists. As you are a CEO you are also rewarded points for filling the Corporate treasury, and building the company's value proposition by retaining rights to the best technologies. Gameplay is fast, and exciting. Events, and the vast variety of hazards that space has to offer will keep you on your toes, and your underlings busy on the paperwork for decades to come!&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases:  Research, Fleet, Management, Revenue, and finally First Player Turn Auction. All players will complete each phase, in turn order, before proceeding to the next phase. This helps to keep the game moving, and keeps players engaged. In Research phase players can pay to research, or choose to license another players tech. In the Fleet phase players get one action with each ship they own. The Management phase is when players build new ships, special tech items, and sell technology to the public domain. The Revenue phase is when players collect their hard earned resources, including a small stipend from their home office on Earth. And finally, the turn auction phase is a bidding war for who goes first. Not that important at the start of the game, but monumental for the end.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The conjectured departure from the historic timeline that resulted in this alternative history wargame is assumed to have taken place in mid-September 1939. At that time, as his forces are completing the conquest of Poland, Hitler receives a flash of intuition. That is, he can&rsquo;t help but notice the strategic paralysis of the Anglo-French, who do nothing to try to prevent the downfall of their fast-disappearing eastern ally Poland. From that he concludes it would be a waste of time to redeploy the Wehrmacht to the western front in 1940. He tells his generals: &ldquo;The time will never be better to destroy the Bolshevik power than in the coming year. We will continue to have nothing to fear in the west. The British and French simply do not want war; they are afraid of it. Once we&rsquo;ve taken Moscow, we&rsquo;ll take Paris and London by telephone.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Accordingly, he also tells his foreign minister to drop all negotiations aimed at revising the original territorial split set out in the accords with the USSR the previous month. Most importantly, Lithuania, originally in the German &ldquo;sphere of interest,&rdquo; is not traded for a further slice of Polish territory.&#10;&#10;All of which has resulted in this low-complexity, strategic-level, alternative history wargame. In it, two to four players can investigate the possibilities inherent in a changed German strategy for 1940. The West Front map is scaled at 16 miles per hexagon. The Eastern Front map is scaled at 25 miles per hex. All Soviet units are armies; all other forces in the game are corps. Each game turn on both maps equals half a month.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by two, three or four. If two play, one commands the Germans, while the other commands both the Anglo-French and Soviets. If played by three, one player commands the Germans, one player commands the Anglo-French, and the third commands the Soviets. If four play, one player commands the Germans on the west map; the second commands the Germans on the east map; the third commands the Soviets, and the fourth commands the Anglo-French. The rules contain some 17,000 words, which means experienced players can finish it in about four hours.&#10;&#10;Rules cover such things as: neutrals, fog of war, airpower, 7th Flieger Corps, Soviet 1st Shock Army, fortifications, and more. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;&#10;     German Player Turn&#10;          A. German Airpower &amp; Strategic Transfer Phase&#10;          B. German West Front Movement Phase&#10;          C. German West Front Combat Phase&#10;          D. German East Front Movement or Combat Phase&#10;          E. German East Front Combat or Movement Phase&#10;          F. German Replacement Phase&#10;          G. German Moscow-Capture Resolution Phase&#10;          H.

The original 2022 version was a decently cutthroat competitive game.  The 2023 release is a friendly teams-based version.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of two each of cards numbered 1-28, with each card representing a day in the month of February (one card is daytime, the other is nightime).  Each week (1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28) is a different colored suit.  Additional special cards (such as a &quot;Leap Year&quot; card and a &quot;Reschedule&quot; card) are included and worked in based on player count.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;2022 Rules&#10; Players must follow either the colored suit of the lead card, or the must play a card of the same day of the week.  Thus, the &quot;1&quot; card could be followed by either a card of that suit (a 1-7) or another Sunday (the 1st, 8th, 15th, or 22nd).&#10;&#10;The highest card played which follows wins the trick (cards not following can't win the trick); in the event of a tie, the nighttime card wins.  The winner gets to mark the day on the calendar as theirs; if a marker is already there, it gets replaced.  The card winning the trick is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;Once a full hand has been played, players shuffle the remaining cards, adding in a pre-determined number of special ability cards, and then play another hand, again competing for calendar space.&#10;&#10;Having the most markers in a particular week earns two points; ties are broken by the marker closest to Sunday.  Having the most markers on a particular day of the week (i.e. Monday) earns one point; ties are broken by the earliest date.  Most points wins; ties are broken by the earliest date.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;2023 Rules&#10; Players must follow the colored suit of the lead card. Unlike in the original game, players cannot follow by playing the same day of the week. However, the latest day following either the colored suit or the same day of the week will win the trick.&#10;&#10;The winning team gets to mark a day on the calendar as theirs; if a marker is already there, it gets replaced. They can choose any space represented by a card in the trick. The card winning the trick is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;Once a full hand has been played, players shuffle the remaining cards, adding in the special ability cards, and then play another hand, again competing for calendar space.&#10;&#10;Having the most markers in a particular day of the week earns two points. Teams also get points for their largest contiguous set of markers. High score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Using basic combat mechanics, the game includes command control strictures to better simulate the differences between French and German capabilities.&#10;&#10;A two-player (German versus French) operational level game. The game includes 228 medium-sized die-cut counters, with the Battalion as the primary maneuver unit, and also includes air units, artillery units, blown bridge chits, pontoon bridge chits, and command draw chits. The colorful map features the Belgian/French border, centered around Sedan along the Meuse River, with each hex representing approximately 2 miles across, and includes such prominent locations as the northern extent of the Maginot Line, and the city of Sedan, as well as various charts and tables for easy reference during play.&#10;&#10;The rules entail a variety of standard and unique rules, such as Roadblocks, Demolishing Bridges, German Pontoon Bridges, Dogfights, Bombing Bridges, Overruns, French Fuel Shortages, the French 2nd Army Cavalry, the French 3rd Brigade de Spahis, Headquarters Activation, Air Support, Operation Niwi, Reinforcements, etc.&#10;&#10;Victory in the game is determined by the accumulation of VPs for control of the Meuse River (primarily involving the quantity of German units that have crossed the bridges), as well as eliminating enemy units.&#10;&#10;Published in World at War Magazine #24, Jun-Jul 2012.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (228 9/16&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Sedan rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game consists of a board, showing 30 different types of contraband goods, Gold, Cigarettes etc, each marked by a small picture and it's name. Each picture has a matching tile, which is placed face down over it. Players each receive a number of chips and then take two or three (depending on the number of players), of the tiles for themselves, announcing which they have taken and then laying them face down in front of them. Now play begins.&#10;&#10;The players take turns to roll the die and then move around the board. At first they generally land on a space where the picture is covered by a tile. They take this tile for themselves, and lay it face down in front of them announcing as they do so which it was. As the tiles start to disappear though, players land on spaces where the tile is already missing. They then have to say who they think has that tile. If correct, they receive the tile. If the named player however thinks that he hasn't got the tile, then he may in turn name another player, and so on until either a named player accepts that he has the tile, or a player who has already been named is named again. Then it is sorted out who really did have the tile, working backwards through the chain of accusations until it is found. The owner, when unmasked, passes it to the first player correctly to have named him, and all players who have falsely accused someone must pay chips into the Bank, one chip for each false accusation made in that turn.&#10;&#10;Obviously, the passing on of tiles complicates matters terribly. It is simple enough to remember who took the tile in the first place, but by the time you have unraveled a chain of four or five false accusations, trying to remember who now has the tile is not so simple. The game goes on until either someone has collected a specified number of tiles, dependent on the number of players, or someone has no chips left. A player's tiles count two points each and every remaining chip one point, so it is quite possible to win without collecting many tiles, you merely have to avoid guessing falsely.&#10;(Jon Webley from GameCabinet)&#10;&#10;",

Trust your animalistic instincts to win elections and hold political offices or plot and pressure the government from the opposition. In the end, whoever has implemented the most political goals, will win.&#10;&#10;Every round there is a parliamentary election campaign where players can spend their food tokens on different animal species to win their votes for the next parliamentary election. The parliament usually gets elected every other round and after that players have to form a coalition with a majority of seats in the parliament. Obviously players with a better election result have an advantage during these negotiations, however it is also possible for weaker parties to form a coalition against stronger ones. The players simply have to agree on how the government offices get distributed and which political goals will be implemented.&#10;&#10;In case the government lost its majority of seats in the parliament, there is also the possibility for the opposition leader to initiate a no-confidence vote against the current government. However to be successful this vote needs a majority of seats as well to elect a new government.&#10;&#10;Moreover there are also presidential election that usually occur every 2 rounds in a direct vote. Here the winners takes it all! The president can also implement a political goal of his party and has some further advantages.&#10;&#10;Finally, some random events may always shake up the situation and force the players to change their plans.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It must place&#10;all of its counters, but they can distribute them among several answers in case of doubts among the team.&#10;&#10;The correct answer is then revealed: the team will keep only the counters that they have placed on the good answer, while the good answer, while the rest will be taken out of the game.&#10;&#10;Step 3: when the 2 teams have played, we start again from step 1. To answer the next question, you will only have the counters you have been able to keep!&#10;&#10;The first team to run out of counters loses the game.

    "Description": "Hartmut Witt always has original game concepts, and he, along with Frank Schaubrenner, has created a fast-paced grab- and collecting-game that will thrill even expert speed-type game players. Rather unusual landscape types need to be crossed in this game: Clay flats, fields, hot sand, green lawns, water and cobblestones, even some rare blue-white or beige tiles. These landscapes are found on 28 large landscape cards, each of which again is made up of 18 landscape spaces, arranged in random fashion.&#10;&#10;The landscape cards get mixed up and distributed among the players (7 each with 3p and 4p, 8 with 2p - the rest go back in the box). Now, each player gets to set two particularly difficult cards aside and places the rest on the table to form a race circuit (the narrow sides of the cards are joined together). Thus, a different track with different challenges is created for each player. A goal card marks the goal for each player.&#10;&#10;Before the game can begin, 48 small cards are placed in the middle of the table as a face-down, spread out pile. Each card shows one of the landscape types mentioned above.&#10;&#10;As soon as the game starts, all players wildly grab through the pile of cards on the table. Cards, once revealed, are left face-up if they're not of immediate use. Cards that a player wants to keep are taken in hand. The order of the cards being collected, though, cannot be altered in any way. The collection phase ends when there's only face-up cards left on the table and a player calls &quot;stop&quot; because he thinks he has enough cards.&#10;&#10;Now, the players will see how far they get along their track with the cards they collected. The player who called &quot;stop&quot; starts. He turns the first card he collected over. If it's sand, for example, he puts his marker on a sand space at the start of his course. Thereafter, each subsequent card must show a landscape type that is next to the one his marker is on (either sideways, forwards or diagonally forwards) for him to move forwards. As soon as a card comes up that doesn't allow him to move his marker, his turn is over. Collected cards that are left over are put back into the middle of the table (face-down), and the figure stays where it managed to get to. Each player in turn order then does the same, moving their figure and returning leftover cards. Continue in this manner, round after round, until one player reaches the goal, ending the game. That player is of course the winner.&#10;&#10;Description of the game from Kosmos.&#10;&#10;",

Army Group South, accompanied by various Axis-Allied Armies, attempted to seize the valuable communications junction at Rostov and establish bridgeheads across the Donets and lower Don rivers. In the fighting around Rostov, the Germans suffered their first strategic setback in their campaign against Russia, as the Soviet Army drove the German mechanized spearhead from this vital area. The Axis Player controls all the German and Axis-allied (Rumanian, Hungarian, Italian and Slovakian) units; the Soviet Player controls all the Soviet units.&#10;&#10;This marks the sixth installment in SPI's Moment in Conflict Series for the Army Group South Game System. Rostov is an operational simulation, which recreates the pivotal battle of Rostov in 1941.  A battle which saw the Germans actually take hold of Rostov, only to be driven out within weeks by wave after wave of Soviet attacks.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 10.5 miles / 17 kilometers&#10;Units: Regiment to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 17 x 22&quot; five-color mapsheets&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page Army Group South rulebook&#10;One 4-page Rostov rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed Army Group South Charts &amp; Tables&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-6 hours&#10;&#10;",

Players have weapons that allow them to attack others on the board at certain positions but must move strategically as the other players reveal their moves all at the same time. The purpose of the game is to escape with the elixir of life while accomplishing missions and capturing as many artifacts and gaining as many kill points as possible.&#10;&#10;Story: The King is dying and has commissioned 2-4 heroes to capture the stone of life in a nearby dungeon from its Dragon guardian. Only each of the other heroes is battling for their own glory and will not be afraid to kill you in order to capture the stone and other valuable artifacts for themselves. Your goal is to either capture the stone yourself, or complete other missions and gather other valuable artifacts to bring back home.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the creator of video game classic Puyo Puyo comes a party game to test your acting abilities.&#10;&#10;Use only facial expressions and the tone of your voice (and sometimes less than that) to portray different scenarios.&#10;&#10;Does that &ldquo;Ha-&ldquo; sound angry, heartbroken, or curious? Players draw a card that determines a topic sound like &ldquo;Ha-&ldquo; or &ldquo;Eh&rdquo; along with a list of eight different scenarios. Individual players then draw a card that assigns them a scenario from the list to enact. Without using any body gestures, players act out their scenario to each other and try to guess who was assigned what.&#10;&#10;The Game of Saying &lsquo;Huh&rsquo; will test your skills of wit and mimicry and bring plenty of laughter and fun to game nights. The game is played in rounds using a different Task card for each round. At the top is a single word or a short phrase you will each have to say, but each of you in a unique way. There are 8 ways listed on the Task card from A to H and you&rsquo;ll be secretly assigned one of them at random. You might have to say &lsquo;Hello!&rsquo; like you&rsquo;re talking to a pet, like you&rsquo;re a vampire or like you&rsquo;re the president. There are lots of common phrases and sayings, as well as a few actions thrown in for good measure. But here&rsquo;s the tricky part: you can only use your voice and facial expression to convey the meaning of what&rsquo;s on the card. Gestures or movement of any kind below the neck are not allowed. When you&rsquo;ve finished making your impression, everybody votes in secret, assigning the correct lettered task to your performance.&#10;&#10;When everyone&rsquo;s finished acting their part, it&rsquo;s time for the big reveal: you&rsquo;ll score if you guessed correctly who acted out which cue, and collect points yourself when others correctly identify your performance. The player with the most points when all the voting is complete wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Can you take the helm of the Syrian army and navy and storm the greatest citadel on earth, or will you instead prevent it and maintain Byzantium&rsquo;s role as Christendom&rsquo;s eastern march?&#10;&#10;",

The twist being, that instead of doing multiple laps, players race their cars to the end of the track and then turn around and race back to the starting line. So if you're the first to turn around, you can be sure that you'll have to weave around the cars still going in the other direction!&#10;And in ZOOM ZOOM KA-BOOM it's allowed to run into your opponents, thus making it harder for them to stay on track once it's their turn...&#10;So try and get ahead.

Thus the Greek is encouraged to batter through some of the Persian foot and close with the cav before turn 4 if possible.&#10;&#10;All in all, a fine simulation given the scope of the system rules. The Persians' only good chance is to resist the Greek hoplites with foot until turn 4 and then try and turn any Greek flank possible, by moving their cavalry away and around the Greeks and charging them in clear terrain - if the Greeks allow themselves to be exploited this way, of course.&#10;&#10;",

These hunts are dangerous depending on the animal you encounter and can end with stolen loyalties, lost scraps, and more!&#10;&#10;SCRAPS are action cards that are collected and shared as the spoils of successful hunts. Instead of leading a hunt on your turn, you can attack another wolf with your scrap cards in order to capture one of their loyalty tokens; however, they can also defend themselves using their own scrap hand.&#10;&#10;Capturing three of a player&rsquo;s five loyalty tokens will make them ALLEGIANT to you and unlock in-game benefits.

The key is building a viable strategy with your own cards and events, while denying key cards from your opponents. Then, cards are played face down one at a time to the Planets. Limited information about each card is disclosed. Players are forced to make decisions with imperfect information gained during the draft and by reading your opponents. Finally, the cards are revealed and resolved. In most cases, players want to be the Strongest or Favored faction to score Victory Points.&#10;&#10;",

Then, deal four cards to each player (concealed in hand). Start your turn by drawing two cards. You can make two actions on your turn. If you have in your hand a Remedy card that treats one of your hexes, you can place it on top of that Hex. You're now closer to winning &mdash; but watch out! Every Remedy contains a list of side effects (other Hexes) that you are now vulnerable to receiving from other players on their turns.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one person has treated all the Hexes in their Shadow.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A tactical dice game. Each player manages a team of bicycle messengers and tries to get as many of his own riders as possible to the goal.&#10;&#10;When rolling a die to move one of your messengers you can land on three different types of fields on the board:&#10;- most fields have no special effect&#10;- some give an energy boost (a vitamin drink)&#10;- some are obstacles which require you to use a vitamin drink, or slow you down.&#10;&#10;Vitamin drinks can be played for other benefits in the game.&#10;&#10;Instead of selecting a single messenger, one can also roll multiple dice for an entire group of riders. This allows a player to choose the most beneficial result, but in turn means that opponents' riders will also move.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as all 3 messengers on a team reach the goal or eight total messengers have reached the goal. The team that has the most messengers at the goal wins. In the case of a tie, the player whose messenger crossed last wins. This is important, since during the end phase players may hold back messengers to avoid reaching the goal too soon.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is low-to intermediate-complexity, two-player, examination of the historic alternative to Montgomery's ill-fated Operation Market Garden. Instead of his left-jab through lowland Holland to the Rhine, we have Patton's proposed right-hook, starting at Metz and swinging north and east toward the Ruhr for a war-winning knockout blow. Or, as an alternative within an alternative, the Allied player may try for a more conservative push straight east to the Rhine, there to create a bridgehead over that German river, thereby likely advancing the advent of V-E Day by at least three or four months.&#10;&#10;As soon as you begin to game Patton's alternative to Montgomery's all or nothing plan, it becomes clear what a huge opportunity Eisenhower missed by backing the wrong subordinate. That is, for the British field marshal's plan to have succeeded, it really did have to go all the way, or at least get across the Rhine in some significant way. Failing short of both the Rhine and the Ruhr, as happened historically, meant a month had been wasted and a lot of lives lost only to create a salient to nowhere. Had Patton's idea been tried, only to fail as badly, a salient of that same size &ndash; but  jutting north into the Rhineland from a base at Metz &ndash; would've done much more for the Allied cause.&#10;&#10;We've broadened the appeal of this design beyond those who enjoy alternative history by including a second, historical, scenario. At first we were only going to cover the actual Market-Garden portion of Montgomery's operations in September 1944. It quickly became apparent, however, portrayed at these time, space and unit scales, such a game would be a dud, with a map only nine hexes long and three wide. So we broadened the thing's shoulders by expanding the coverage to take in all Montgomery's possibilities that fateful month. So now you can choose a straight-up historic approach, or you can have alternative history within your actual history.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map equals seven miles from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents three days. Playing pieces represent divisions, brigades, combat commands, Kampfgruppen and regiments of various kinds of infantry and armor formations, each containing from about 3,000 to 14,000 men and 50 to 400 or so armored fighting vehicles.&#10;&#10;",

While simple to learn and quick to complete, games are fun and competitive for all ages.&#10;&#10;Players split into two teams and each player chooses a character.  Each character has a clear plastic playing card for a weapon.  Players use these weapons to attack simultaneously by throwing the cards at opposing characters.  Hitting a character with your weapon causes a hit, and damage is scored (1 for limbs, 2 for body or 3 damage for head shots).  If a player accumulates 7 or more damage, he/she is eliminated.  After attacking, each player moves one card length in any direction. &#10;Play repeats until only one team remains.  Last team standing, wins.&#10;&#10;Each character in Rise of the Exiled has at least one ability to enhance their usefulness on the field of battle.  For example, one character can &quot;Blot out the Sky&quot; twice per game to make all opponents attack with their eyes closed on their next attack.&#10;&#10;",

The aim in the game is to enlarge your fortune thanks to smart investments in rolling stock.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of investors who meet at the locomotive auction and try to buy the best of auctioned railway vehicles. Locomotive cards are not the only ones available for purchase though, because investors also compete for the most valuable railway wagons.&#10;&#10;The game is played for three rounds, each of which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the players bid locomotive cards. The auction type in each round is determined by drawing one of the six auction tokens. During the bidding of locomotive cards, the players should pay attention not only to its price, but also to the multiplier placed on the card (the higher, the greater the potential profits) as well as the locomotive speed. Once all the players have already purchased three locomotives, the second stage takes place. In this stage they are attaching wagons to their locomotives. They also make a choice: either to take one of the face-up wagon cards and attach to one of their locomotives, to pass and do not take any card, or to pay for replacing cards on the table and only then decide, whether to take one of the available wagons.&#10;&#10;The round is over when one of the locomotives of any player has its fifth wagon attached. Then, all the players are summing up the profits. Each player adds up the value of the wagons attached to the locomotive, then the obtained score is multiplied by the multiplier of the locomotive. This process is repeated for each of the locomotives. The earned money supplies the player's account. After three rounds, all the players add up their earned money. The player who earned the most, wins.&#10;&#10;Take a Train is an entertaining and exciting game, which gives everyone a chance to feel like a rail market tycoon.&#10;&#10;",

These Champions are broken up into three distinct classes--Strikers, Guardians, and Adherents--with each Champion having his or her own strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities which you will use by harnessing the power of mystical glyphs. As the game progresses, your Champions will have the opportunity to acquire new items which will enhance their capabilities as well as perhaps give them even more skills to use to defeat your enemy.&#10;&#10;Glyph utilizes an intriguing dice-building and card-drafting mechanic, which rewards tactical thought as well as provides exciting gameplay. The dice in the game represent ancient powers, which each color of dice having a unique face structure tailored to specific Glyphs. Each Glyph serves a specific purpose and, through rolling and manipulating the dice, your Champions will be able to perform actions ranging from devastating attacks, to fortified defensive stances, to supportive aid. Each Champion also has various item slots available and you will be able to acquire unique weapons and armor to aid you in combat. Some items are rather simple and provide minor boosts to your champion's dice pool, while others have their own unique abilities that only the wearer of the item can perform.&#10;&#10;These items come at a cost, however: you may be required to spend [read: trash] dice from your own champion's pool in order to acquire these powerful items. This makes item acquisition much more than merely taking an available card--you will need to weigh the costs and benefits of these items and determine if sacrificing the requisite dice is worth it.&#10;&#10;The decisions you make each round will have a lasting influence on the tide of battle. Do you take advantage of a weakened Champion and attack or try to accumulate wealth to purchase a suit of armor to protect you in subsequent rounds? Battle will rage until there is but one side left standing. Will you bring honor or disgrace to your tribe?&#10;&#10;",

Using competing captures, tactics, and strategies, players each strive to be the first player to win by either: 1) moving or flipping his/her Xing (Emperor) onto the Golden Throne in the center of the board; or, 2) capturing the opponent's Xing (Emperor).&#10;&#10;Note that good initial placement is highly important for success in ZoxSo; while sharp and accurate play during the &quot;Race to the Throne&quot; phase to follow-up the initial placement is, well, pretty much just as important.&#10;&#10;Players are sometimes surprised at how strategically and tactically &quot;brutal&quot; ZoxSo can be, but that's simply the nature of the beast.

    "Description": "Welcome, brewmasters, to the world renowned Bavarian festival known as Oktoberfest! The 1810 wedding celebration of Crown Prince Ludwig I and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen swiftly became an annual tradition known as Oktoberfest. Each year the scope of the festival expanded, and by the late 1800s sponsored beer halls and competing breweries were in full operation.&#10;&#10;Oktoberfest is a card-driven game loosely based on the folk festival which began as a public celebration of a royal wedding. Based during the festival in the late 1800s, players vie for control of each of six types of beer, even though many of those beer styles are barely available in Bavaria and completely unrelated to Oktoberfest. As patrons arrive at the festival, players bid to decide where they go and how much they drink. By placing cards in the various tents, players can purchase barrels of beer based on the type and number of patrons on the card. The player who gets rid of the most barrels of each gains points for that type of beer at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The problem? The game ends before all twelve tents can be completed, and only closed tents count for points. Whichever beer type is the last in the tent before it closes claims all points for that tent, and the players with the most barrels of each type acquire points.&#10;&#10;But watch out for the evacuation card that comes out randomly and wipes out entire tents. Collect the right types of barrels, close tents with the corresponding beer cards on top, and victory could be yours!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Kursk: Operation Zitadelle, 4July 1943&quot; is the first wargame by SPI (or anyone else) on history's largest land battle.&#10;&#10;The stark four-color map extends 440 miles from north to south at about 9 miles per hex. Games last 6 turns. The time scale, though not stated, is probably two days per turn. (The historical battle ran 12 days.) Units are German divisions (light gray) and ahistorical Soviet &quot;corps&quot; (brown), plus a handful of smaller formations. They have combat and movement factors (e. g., 6-8 for the best German panzer divisions, 2-4 for a Soviet infantry &quot;corps&quot;). The Germans have several non-divisional panzer units that must be stacked with a German division in order to use their combat factor.  The Soviets have artillery and anti-tank brigades that can only use their combat factor in attack or defense, respectively.&#10;&#10;Four bands of fortified lines dominate the map, one German line and three Soviet lines. The Soviet fortified lines are indicated as they existed in May, June and July 1943.  All four lines are used during the historical scenario but not all of the Soviet lines apply to some of the hypothetical scenarios.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave). The stacking limit is three divisions or &quot;corps&quot;, plus one smaller formation, per hex. The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Supply lines must be traced over no more than 10 hexes to a rail line leading off a friendly map edge, with lack of supply halving movement and combat factors.&#10;&#10;Air power is represented semi-abstractly by air units that can fly close support, interdiction, combat air patrol, air superiority or interception missions. There are no command rules, but a couple of optional rules try to suggest organizational differences between the two armies. These options are quite advantageous to the Germans, who, as in reality, need all the help they can get. One of these optional rules is the ability of the German mechanized divisions to not be completely removed from play on an Eliminate result, but be replaced by low-strength Kampfgrupen (this became a standard rule in later games).&#10;&#10;The wargame includes six scenarios: historical and free setup scenarios for the historical July start date, hypothetical May and June German attacks, and two hypothetical August Soviet counteroffensives (one with a fixed and the other with a free setup). 255 counters&#10;&#10;For its day, Kursk: Operation Zitadelle was a &quot;monster game&quot; and more attentive to history than many of its rivals. SPI used the same basic system, generally with elaborations, in later World War II games, such as Breakout &amp; Pursuit, The Moscow Campaign and Destruction of Army Group Center.&#10;&#10;",

Three cards are revealed face up. On a turn, you can either take a face-up card or the top card from the deck, or you can attempt to guess your suspect's characteristics. When you take a card, you hold it up next to your case card, then the other players tell you how many characteristics they have in common. You then place this card in front of you, rotating it so that the number on the outer edge of the card shows how many characteristics they share (0-3).&#10;&#10;When you guess, if you're correct, you discard the case card and place a new one in the stand; if you're wrong, you continue the game as normal next turn.

If a player can form a chain of cards that follows these rules, they can put all the cards except for the last one into their personal collection. &#10;Each card exists twice, and by playing a card on its twin, a player blocks the space to all other players (until he or she has to pass, then the blockade is lifted). This gains the player an additional turn with some privileges.&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of hand cards or the draw pile is used up, the round ends and element tokens are handed out.
