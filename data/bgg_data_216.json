On a turn, a player rolls the die and either moves a piece on the pitch or enters a piece onto the middle square of his side of the pitch. A piece must use the full die result, can move only orthogonally, and can't enter the same space twice on a move. Spaces with other pieces in them aren't off-limits, but the cost in die points to move into and out of such spaces equals one plus the altitude difference between the two spaces. When you end movement in a space with another piece, you place your piece on top of it, trapping it. Stacks can be of any height &ndash; but make sure you are able to leave again when you climb a stack!&#10;&#10;A player who cannot make a move is eliminated, but his pieces remain on the pitch. The last player who can move wins.&#10;&#10;",

Cards are divided into three fractions - left, right and neutral. Each player plays with his own, prepared deck.

    "Description": "Another in the line of very small card games by Reinhard Staupe. The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score.

    "Description": "Black Monday gets its name from the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, and it's a commercial edition of Sid Sackson's game &quot;Card Stock Market&quot; from the book Card Games Around the World, with this game being playable with two standard decks of playing cards.&#10;&#10;The game includes 104 cards, with corporation cards in four colors. Each card shows a monetary value, along with a number of shares. Reveal cards from the deck until you get one card of each color, and use these cards to set the starting price of the shares for each of the four corporations. Deal each player a hand of eight cards, and give each player $20,000 as starting capital.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can deal in shares (both buying and selling) and change the value of stocks, but you must do all of your dealing either prior to or subsequent to changing stock values. When you deal, you can sell any number of shares you own, earning money from the bank equal to the number of shares sold by the current value of those shares; when you buy, you can lay down at most two cards from your hand, paying money to the bank equal to the number of shares bought by the current value of those shares.&#10;&#10;When you change value, you take one or two cards from your hand and cover a corporation's current value with this new value; corporations have different limits on how much they can be raised or lowered per card play, with some being more stable than others. If you play the highest-valued cards, you can either pump up the value tremendously &mdash; or tank the stock, bringing its value to $0, with all players discarding all shares they own of this stock. (A player can jumpstart the value of this company by playing a new stock value on it, even with the second card played on the same turn.)&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can skip the dealing and changing actions to discard 1-4 cards from hand. In either case, to end your turn, replenish your hand to eight cards.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, take all of the discards and all of the stock value cards other than the top one of each corporation and shuffle them together with a &quot;Market Closed&quot; card to form a new deck. Continue play until the &quot;Market Closed&quot; card is drawn, at which point the game ends immediately, and all shares held by players are cashed out at the current stock value. Whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Serengeti: A Race For Life is a game for two players set in the African savannah.&#10;&#10;In an attempt to preserve the ecosystem and ensure there is a future for its wildlife, your mission will be to study the animals that inhabit the Serengeti.&#10;&#10;In addition, you will be rewarded if lions can thrive in the savannah, as long as you can keep scorpions out of your headquarters!&#10;&#10;The game takes place over a variable number of turns called seasons. During each season, players play cards from their hand in order to track animals, or to use their skills.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with just a few trails, a card that will allow them to track animals from the supply, adding them to their individual deck to adjust it to suit a particular strategy.&#10;&#10;Animals provide them with unique ways to deal with the various threats in the game as well as helping them to efficiently manage their resources.&#10;&#10;Animals do more than just produce game effects to rely on during the game however, and are a main source of points.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, victory points will be awarded depending on the players&rsquo; deck content as well as majority in the savannah.&#10;&#10;The competition track may also tilt the outcome in favour of the player who best achieved to stay one or more step ahead of their opponent!&#10;&#10;",

If the player draws a disease with the same name as a disease already on the table, he was too greedy and his turn ends immediately. All the cards were drawn in this turn being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then earn as much money as much card he draws and buys one card (Product / Signature for Law / Action). Of course, players can vaccinate themselves: this hypocrisy costs them -1 point per vaccinate but give them a possibility to ignore the first card of a disease per turn.&#10;&#10;When one player has at least ten influence points the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game you wind Manuel's arm into his body, place a plastic tray onto his raised hand and you're ready to play.  Each player is then given the same number of dishes (but not necessarily the same of each type) and then, in turn, each player flicks a spinner which tells him how many 3D objects to place on Manuel's tray - plates, bowls, glasses, cups and saucers.&#10;&#10;So far, it's just a simple balancing game.  But the spinner also tells you if you have to Tip The Waiter.  If you do, you have to reach behind Manuel and flick a lever which extends his arm a short distance.  The more the arm extends, the more unstable the tray of dishes becomes.  Eventually Manuel's arm tips and all the dishes fall off and are given to the person who caused Manuel to drop the dishes.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get rid of all your dishes first.&#10;&#10;Very similar in theme and name to Don't Tip the Waiter and Don't Tip the Waiter .&#10;&#10;",

Four to six players engage in head-to-head (-to-head-to-head) constant combat until the frenzy peaks and one player emerges victorious.&#10;&#10;Set in an alternate 1920s, an eclectic collection of some of the world&rsquo;s greatest fighters are pitted against each other by the magnanimous Baron Reginald Fistcuffington Smythe aboard his monolithic floating airship. Baron Smythe, inventor of the new super-element Hydrolium, offers the winner of his &quot;Fisticuffs Bouts&quot; the granting of a single wish, whatever their heart desires most. The surviving fighter will get their wish fulfilled - and become champion of Fisticuffs!&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simple. Each player picks a fighter from our cast of characters, each with their own backstory and special move. The stable of fighters include a sky pirate, a flapper, a saxo-magician, the son of a slain Chicago mayor, and a robot built by Baron Smythe himself. Every player gives their fiercest battle cry, and whoever&rsquo;s is best begins the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with five cards from the Punch Card deck. These Punches will be a fighter&rsquo;s offense and defense. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they throw a Punch against any opponent - but that player can Block if they are holding a Punch of the same name. This leaves the attacking player open for a Counter, allowing the defending player to attack with a Punch that is the same color as their Block.&#10;&#10;Combat continues until a Punch goes un-Blocked or a Block goes un-Countered. When an attack successfully lands, the defending player loses health. Everybody starts at 12, and when they reach 0, they&rsquo;re knocked out for the rest of the match. Every remaining player gets a turn each round.&#10;&#10;Once a full round (one turn for everybody) has been completed, the fighters return to their corner. This is when you draw new Punch Cards - and when you get a Round Card, a special action that will help provide a tactical advantage by giving you more attacks, depleting an opponent&rsquo;s defenses, or giving you the edge you need in the middle of combat. The new round begins to the left of the person who started the last round.&#10;&#10;The rounds keep going until there are two boxers left, at which point they enter Close Combat - no more rounds, no more Round Cards, just two boxers fighting over one dream. The fighter that is left standing is the winner of the bout and the champion of Fisticuffs!&#10;&#10;",

You decide how corrupt to be.&#10;&#10;Every player is dealt seven cards and can place three voter cards face up in front of them (creating a voter map) each turn. Depending on how many players, you'll need at least three voters in three regions, all of the same political affiliation, on your map to win (undecided voters are wild).&#10;&#10;Peppered in the deck are RAT cards, which give you strong advantages. However, every time you play a RAT card, you must also draw a Scandal card, which contains a punishment. This punishment is not enacted immediately &mdash; rather, it sits face down in front of you until someone plays a DIG card on you. The DIG card will force you to turn over a scandal and abide by the punishment. Do you risk a scandal, or do you play it safe? The choice is yours in this dirty game of American elections.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kawa is a game of quiet contemplation for 2 to 4 players, named after the word for river (&#229;&#183;&#157;) in Japanese.&#10;&#10;In Kawa, you guide petals down a river made up of 16 unique tiles. Each round, players will follow the currents and eddies printed on the tiles to send their petals downstream, leaving petals behind as they do.&#10;&#10;As the river comes alive with colour, players must carefully avoid flowing into other players' petals&mdash;when that occurs, those players gain points. This is made all the more challenging as when each player flows, they swap two adjacent river tiles, changing up the river's paths.&#10;&#10;Between each round, the river flows forward, washing away the furthest row of tiles and shuffling them back to the start. Hence, simply following the river's currents is easy - but mastering the game will require players to learn to read its constantly changing flow. After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Flora and fauna, represented as special tiles, breathe life into the river. Every game, players replace two river tiles with special tiles, each with their own unique effects. These range from a Crab that shuffles up the board by scuttling across the river, to a Shrine that rewards players for spreading their petals across as much as the river as possible. With nine different special tiles of varying complexity to choose from, both casual and hardcore players will find something new to love each foray down the river.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When the bid gets high enough, let's say 17, a fellow pirate may call the bluff.&#10;&#10;Once called, you have to prove your bluff by picking one card at a time from the grid. You can pick whatever card you have your eye one, but must follow the instructions on the cards. Some cards are curses that make the game more treacherous for you while others are a bit of luck. If you pull a Pirate's Mark card, you are out for now but may return later if you successfully call another pirate's bluff. However, if you are successful the player who called your bluff must pull a card themselves as punishment. Bluffing then resumes and gameplay continues until there are only 2 players left or 10 cards at sea. At this point, duel mode is enacted and players pull one card at a time until only one is left un-marked and wins the game!&#10;&#10;This game keeps you on the edge of your seat because the tides can turn at any time. It's a great game for small and larger groups that mixes luck and skill well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Combining the tactile nature of dice rolling, the excitement of a &quot;first to buzz in&quot; mechanism, and pattern recognition that is sure to exercise your brain, FrankenDie will bring your party or game-night to life!&#10;&#10;THEME: You are a Mad Scientist competing to assemble a Creature from serviceable body parts scavenged from the graveyard. Once your Creature has a &quot;lightly used&quot; head, body, two arms, two legs and the all-important brain, it's time to re-animate it with a charge of lightning and a cry of... &quot;It's Aliiiiiive!&quot;&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY: Players take turns rolling the dice and looking for a set to call out. For instance: &quot;3 Brains!&quot; But all players are competing to call out a set AND be the first to place a hand on the graveyard. If you're successful, you get to keep the body part you spotted. Assemble a full creature, then call out a set of lightning to bring it to life!&#10;&#10;Now, this is no walk in the graveyard. No sir. Because when you're a mad scientist, it can cost an arm and a leg to get a head. If you want to build the Creature of your dreams, you'll have to know when to make a mad dash to the graveyard, and when to wait out your trigger-happy, mistake prone colleagues.&#10;&#10;So get a head start, and show your friends that your genius is beyond compare.&#10;&#10;",

For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players collect cards, sabotage opponents, and compete to create roadkill.&#10;&#10;The deck is made up of three kinds of cards: vehicle cards, animal cards, and roadside cards. Players collect vehicle cards and animal cards. If the combination is right, a player will use a vehicle card to run over an animal card and score points.&#10;&#10;Roadside cards provide an element of randomness. Some affect an individual, and some affect the group. Some are beneficial, and some are punishing. Beware of offramps, rush hour, and the police.&#10;&#10;Lastly, players have the option to sabotage their opponent's strategy by attacking, forcing their opponent to discard. Strong animal cards can kill weaker ones, and large vehicle cars can run smaller ones off the road.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Four Mafia &quot;Families,&quot; controlled by two to four players, vie for control of the island of Sicily. Each Family consists of a Boss and two gangs of young thugs (picciotti).&#10;&#10;The mafioso are opposed by the forces of the Italian State who are controlled by an additional player (except under the four-player rules, where the players share responsibility for moving the State's counters). The State player controls the Prefetto (Prefect), three Carabinieri (military police) units, and a secret-service (SISDE) agent. The State has also established some static roadblocks around the island which can snare careless mafioso. Through their combined efforts, the forces of the State seek to arrest as many Bosses and picciotti as they can.&#10;&#10;Two decks of cards are used to reflect events stemming from the influence of mafia allies in the United States and support for the Prefetto from the Italian continent. A third card deck represents the evidence the secret-service agent can gather to establish grounds for the Prefetto to arrest Bosses.&#10;&#10;But the justice system is weak. Detainees and arrestees will be released without warning. Shootouts erupt across the island. Innocent diners can face repeated attacks at their favorite ristorante. The violence is unending, with ambushes and assassinations seeming to be as common as the leaves on the olive trees. However, there is no player-elimination element, or even permanent elimination of units. Replacements will always arrive from the continent, although that will take a variable amount of time.&#10;&#10;The playing board is a track of 26 loosely-defined spaces running around the perimeter of the island of Sicily, and through the center, in a sort of a B-shaped pattern. The board includes three significant Sicilian cities (Palermo, Catania, and Enna) which can serve as headquarters for the Mafia Families. Units move by a roll of the dice in a clockwise fashion, using the combined total of the dice to move one unit, or the individual numbers shown on the dice to move two units.&#10;&#10;The Families are in a race to be the first to control four spaces on the board, but the State can prevail if it imprisons enough Bosses and picciotti to remediate the plague of criminal violence.&#10;&#10;Mafia is a straightforward game with an unusual setting. It aroused some discussion in Italian newspapers when it first came out. The game approaches its deadly serious subject with a sarcastic tone, and somewhat sanitized violence, for a strategic and thematic gaming experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lost in Time is a thematic game centering around time travel with three sets of rules that allow for different ways of play. The game consists of 88 cards with beautiful historical illustrations.&#10;&#10;The first version of the game is light and easy, specifically designed for children ages 10 and up. It's the year 2031: you are one of the very first time travelers and you have been sent to the past. However, your time machine does not work as it was supposed to (isn't that typical!) and you are left stranded in the past. Now you have to get back to the year 2031. The player who is the closest to the year 2031 after the eighth leap wins! Each game round the players must place a card on their timeline but the problem is: not everybody will want to travel to the future like you do, some will want to jump to the past. And if you can't place anything on your timeline, you run the risk of being absorbed by the vortex. It's a tug-of-war in time &amp; space. Duration of play: 20 to 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;The second version, The Time Bandits, is semi-cooperative and lets the players choose between being the secret agents or the thieves. The thieves, sent to the past by a criminal organization, must collect four historical artifacts before the eighth card has been played &mdash; without being caught by the agents. These agents have been hired &amp; vigourously trained by the government to hunt the criminals down throughout the centuries before they end up changing the past and thus also automatically...the future. All players receive a deck of 18 cards which represent their time machine's battery allowing them to conjure up a wormhole in order to jump into time. The players must keep a close eye on the level of their battery: if it's empty, they will not be able to jump in time anymore and they will end up Lost in Time. In this version, the players are allowed to take items with them in their backpack to help save their skin if they end up in a historical disaster (Battle of the Somme or Eruption of the Vesuvius...). Both the agents and thieves can also make use of famous historical characters (Elizabeth I, Napoleon or Lenin...) to help them stop their rivals! If a players ends up in a period within the influence of a historical character who is allied to his rival, he will be in serious trouble! Duration of play: 30 to 40 minutes.&#10;&#10;The third version is a solo variant. An attack has been made on your lab, and you've managed to escape in the &quot;nick of time&quot; by opening up a vortex and jumping in. You are a lonesome chrononaut with only one objective: get back to the year 2031 and prevent the attack on the lab. Before traveling to the past, you must decide how many batteries (deck of cards) to bring along. Every leap in time costs an amount of energy and even moreso if you end up in a period of disaster. When your batteries are empty, you are stuck in time, so you must be economical with your available energy! Will you jump in time immediately and save your battery, or will you press your luck and spend more energy in order to find a data chip that will help your travel through time more easily? Duration of play: 15 to 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;Can you survive the past?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1886 in a small forgettable hovel of a town on the border of nowhere. Several unscrupulous individuals come together for a hand of poker over a pile of cash. A whispered accusation of chicanery crosses the table and irons are yanked from holsters. The sparse crowd dives for cover and lead arcs towards flesh, the saloon aching for a fresh coat of crimson.&#10;&#10;A Fistful of Dinero, the first game published by Magic House Games, is a card game for 3-6 players set in the wild west. After a poker game goes terribly wrong, players draw their weapons, make a quick grab for the cash, throw chairs, dive for cover, and do everything they can to be the richest gunslinger &mdash; or just the last man standing...&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, players draft cards and place (program) them in one of three slots. Then in player order, players reveal the first slot and take one of the two available actions. Players can fire their weapons, hide beyond cover, switch weapons, grab money, etc. Players also have the opportunity to &quot;throw&quot; chairs or other items (cards) onto an opponent's player board to do additional damage.&#10;&#10;The game ends in two ways: If a player takes five points of damage, he's dead and out of the game, with the last man (or woman!) standing winning it all. Alternatively, if the pot of dinero ever runs out, the richest outlaw wins.&#10;&#10;Highlights Include:&#10;-Card Drafting with Conflict&#10;-Action Programming&#10;-Completely unique cover system based on seating location&#10;-Literally throw chairs, tables, knives, tomahawks, and dynamite at your opponents by physically tossing cards&#10;-Descriptive wounds with story flair and lasting repercussions&#10;-Intense narrative that unfolds organically from actions performed (heavily inspired by the classic Avalon Hill game Gunslinger)&#10;&#10;",

The British and Spanish monarchs did not reckon with the ambitions of Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and Emperor of the French. The wily Napoleon III schemed to conquer Mexico and set up a puppet regime that would bleed Mexico of its treasures to finance a resurgent French Empire.&#10;&#10;Napoleon III picked an obscure Austrian archduke named Maximilian to be his cat&rsquo;s-paw and supported the effort with thousands of French troops. Even though there was some local support in Mexico for the return to a monarchy, most of the country remained loyal to the elected president, Benito Juarez and the French spent huge amounts of treasure and blood to try to put down the Republican Forces. From 1862 through 1866, Napoleon III and his puppet Maximilian attempted to forge a Mexican Empire, but after the United States won its Civil War, the threat of an invasion from the North and growing concerns about the ascendancy of the Prussian military in Europe forced Napoleon to withdraw his army from Mexico. The remaining troops loyal to Maximilian were not enough to stop the growing Republican army, and Maximilian was captured and executed in 1867.&#10;&#10;Can you, as the French/Imperial Mexican player succeed where Napoleon III failed and pacify a hostile land? You have some of the finest units in the French army, including the famed Foreign Legion, volunteers from Austria, Belgium and Egypt, and a growing army of loyal Mexicans at your disposal. Or, as the Republican Player, can you outwit the powerful French army and restore Mexico to its rightful ruler, Benito Juarez?&#10;&#10;Design - Andy Nunez&#10;Development - Paul Rohrbaugh&#10;Graphic Design - Craig Grando&#10;&#10;",

The Italian units, particularly the Savoia Grenadiers, fought so well the Commonwealth forces had to conduct three assaults to break their position. Indeed, the Savoia Grenadiers were never dislodged from their hilltop position, and were only compelled to surrender after being surrounded an after the other Italian positions had fallen. In spite of their ultimate defeat, it&rsquo;s regarded as one of the Italian Army&rsquo;s most impressive showings during the entire war.&#10;&#10;Keren includes one counter sheet (228 counters) and one map of the Keren area of Eritrea (each hex represents about 220 yards), portraying the Dongolaas Gorge and the heights on both sides, dominating the area south of Keren. The system&rsquo;s unique feature is the ability of infantry units to self-reduce to dispatch men as supply-runners, as was necessary for both sides historically. Fighting atop the difficult hills will give players a sense of why the Italians were so difficult to dislodge, as well as the importance of artillery and air support, and the limitation on the usefulness of tanks.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;Magazine: World at War #25&#10;&#10;",
