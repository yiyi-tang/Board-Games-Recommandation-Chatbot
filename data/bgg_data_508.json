Although it is designed for solo play, it allows a second player to control the Son'a.&#10;&#10;You play as the crew of the Enterprise-E, and your goal is to guide the Ba'ku to safety. Inhibiting your progress are the Son'a and their drones which attempt to tag the Ba'ku, thus removing them from the board. You win the game if at least one of the Ba'ku makes it to safety. Combat in the game is resolved using a variant of the Icon System that is featured in Last Unicorn's Star Trek: The Next Generation RPG.&#10;&#10;",

It was idly invented for a prize in Round One of BlogNomic (http://blognomic.com), and has been polished slightly for more-than-two-player games since.&#10;&#10;Get a load of blank cards; at least ten per person. Everyone then scribbles arbitrary conversational sentences ('Hello.' 'How are you?' 'Yes.' 'No.' 'You're very tall.') onto the cards, until they're all covered. Shuffle them all together, deal five to each person and leave a face-down draw pile.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, players must either play a card from their hand that follows conversationally from the previous card (or opens the conversation, if they're the first to play), or - if they can't go - draw a new card from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;It sounds a bit of a throwaway game, but there's a good level of strategy and humour to it; the 'offensiveness' and 'defensiveness' of particular sentences, the vagueness of wild cards, the general effect of cartoon characters communicating via pre-written signboards. Language is a game, after all.&#10;&#10;Available at:&#10;http://kevan.org/games/confab.html&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game for the piecepack.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was a beautiful summer day in the Kingdom of Frogtopia and four young and bored frogs of varying social classes were looking for a little adventure to pass the day. And the addition of danger would only make the adventure all that more exciting. One of the young frogs said he had heard of a dangerous game called Crocodile Hop that was played by the frog knights to prove one&rsquo;s froghood in the olden days. A game where a frog knight would display his agility and bravery by taunting Young Croc while hopping from lily pad to lily pad. A game that occasionally ended with the loss of limb and sometimes even life. A game that was no longer played.&#10;&#10;&quot;Although one of the young frogs was a little hesitant to play such a reckless and dangerous game, comments were made about him being a tadpole and &ldquo;Do I see still see a tail back there?&rdquo; that eventually peer pressure won. &ldquo;Besides Old Croc is now so old he can barely move and he is quite predictable&rdquo; another one of the young frogs said. With that the young frogs headed out to the other side of the swamp looking for Old Croc.&#10;&#10;&quot;Once they arrived at the other side of the swamp they started to splash and make noise trying to rouse Old Croc. &ldquo;Look there he is, there he is&rdquo; said one of the young frogs &ldquo;and he moves about as fast a slug in the mud&rdquo;. Then Old Croc came up and with his huge mouth swallowed up a whole lily pad with just one bite. The young frogs started hopping from lily pad to lily pad as they yelled at old Old Croc &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get me you old slug&rdquo; and the game began. Old Croc was popping up out of the water chomping down lily pads while the young frogs hopped from pad to pad before he could get them.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then one of the young frogs noticed something, there seemed to be less and less lily pads to jump to and the ones that were left were getting harder to reach. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s running us out of lily pads&rdquo; he yelled and that was when the young frogs realized what they had gotten themselves into.&quot;&#10;&#10;A mad hopping game for the piecepack -- hop your foolish young frogs to victory, while avoiding being eaten by Old Croc.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you may move your frog on space orthogonally, and you must slide one row or column of lily pads one space.  (You may perform these actions in either order.)  When two or more groups of lily pads are formed, such that they are not touching, or only touching by a single corner, the smaller group &quot;sinks&quot; and is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The goal is to sink the opposing frog, while keeping yours afloat.&#10;&#10;The game was designed by 9-year-old Sean Allen and self-published at www.frog-pond.com.  It was packaged with the expansion: Lily Pads of Doom, in which special powers are printed on the lily pad tiles, which occur when the pad is sunk. (With one exception: the Tar Pit, which takes effect when landed on.)  To play without the expansion, you simply ignore the text on the tiles.&#10;&#10;",

Each edge has either no cutout (a blank edge), or half a square, circle or diamond.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to add tiles to the layout, always matching edges. Scoring is simple: whenever a player completes a square or rectangle of tiles of any size they score points equal to the number of tiles in the square or rectangle.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10 stones, and must play if possible each turn. If not, they take a stone from the reserve. As soon as one player has played all his stones the game ends and the scores are tallied. Any stones remaining with a player count as -1; if he has taken from the reserve at any time during the game then each stone remaining counts as -5!&#10;&#10;The game was made in England by Merit, and appears to date from the 50s or 60s (no date is given on the game materials). The so-called stones are nicely made components that fit neatly into the small square box.&#10;&#10;The rules suggest that there are 35 stones in the game. The combinations of symbols that appear on the stones are:&#10;&#10;     4 symbols the same (all 4 possible stones)&#10;     3 symbols the same, 1 different (all 12 possible combinationss)&#10;     2 pairs of 2 symbols, matching pairs are adjacent (all 6 possible combinations)&#10;     1 pair the same and 2 other symbols, matching pair is adjacent (12 of 24 possible combinations, including one of each mirror-image pair)&#10;     4 different symbols (1 of 6 possible combinations).&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;In 1924 middle England at the residence of an esteemed occult collector, a Mr John Wilson, a murder was discovered. John had been in the middle of a dinner party with some good friends when his wife screamed from the garden. Tabitha Wilson had been taking a walk for some after dinner air when she came across the remains of the gardener. The poor man had been decapitated and eviscerated on the lawn.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Police were called to the scene and the investigation begun. Yet more horror was to come. A strange rustling noise came from the hedges at the end of the garden and it drew everyone's eyes. In a sudden rush men burst through the greenery each wielding a knife and screaming for blood.&#10;&#10;&quot;John's first thoughts were for the valuable occult Artefacts he had placed around the gardens pathways. He had been planning a tour of the gardens and his Artefacts as after-dinner entertainment. He rushed towards the oncoming fiends calling his friends to help. Suddenly the yelling interlopers fell silent and stepped aside and through their ranks stepped a huge fearsome betentacled thing...&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a Print and Play game based on the Cthulhu stories by H.P. Lovecraft. The objective of the game is to collect all three Artefacts -- a player wins when he has all three Artefacts in the Hexs of his own base line.&#10;&#10;",

Movement happens based on the roll of a large wooden die, the instructions written on several special squares, or by playing cards out of the players hand.  The cards can only be used once.&#10;&#10;When the first player reaches home, they count the numbers on the unused cards in their 2-10 pile.  The other players are allowed one more turn to get home.&#10;&#10;They may try to continue if unsuccessful, but every turn costs them one point from the cards they hold.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who gets home with the most points.&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the roles of inmates from Angola prison with different sentences, and spin their way around the board, hoping for eventual parole when they obtain 1,000 points. They must endure &quot;Unavoidable Circumstances,&quot; ranging from frame-ups by enemy inmates to extortion, and players may commit offenses as well, which could land them in the work camp or the &quot;Dungeon,&quot; or simply lose you the game (e.g. suicide). Good behavior and informing on other inmates may help players to be freed. The game is made to convey the hopelessness of prison life, as some players may not win at all if their sentences are not commuted. The designer created the game to be played by youth offenders to encourage them to stay out of prison.&#10;&#10;",

Players must first land on a 'buy' square to purchase up their first property: then increase its value with by spending money on 'developments' and 'advice cards'. Once the kitchen, bathroom and garden are renovated, the player can sell - if they land on the right square. A renovated property means a profitable sale: the extra cash can then be spent buying, and improving, a more expensive property. The winner is the first player to buy, renovate and then sell three properties in succession.&#10;&#10;Landing on 'repairs' or 'council tax' squares can cost the player money; if you run out of money in hand, you have to 're-mortgage' your property, meaning you can't develop until you get more cash by passing Go. And if you're out of cash and have no un-mortgaged property, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;There's a balance to be struck between cash now and cash later: buying an expensive property early on, or investing a lot in the optional (but profitable) 'advice cards', pays higher dividends - but it can leave you stuck for ready cash and hold up your progress by re-mortgaging.&#10;&#10;This amusing game was exclusively available at Marks &amp; Spencer in Q4 2007.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This simple game consists of tiles with parts of cute colorful snakes. The players try to make the longest snake.Serpentino is a Dutch game for younger children. There are two ways of playing, one more suited to very young kiddies.&#10;&#10;The 54 cards are used, to form seven snakes. Four of the snakes have seven parts to their body plus a head and a tail, whilst three other snakes have four parts to their body plus, again, a head and a tail.&#10;&#10;Four children can play the simpler game. The cards are shuffled and placed face-down in a stack. In his turn, a player takes the top card and if it is a head, he places it in front of him. Now, on future turns, another card is drawn. If it is a body part, it is added to the head and so on. The idea is to for each player to make a snake as long as possible after drawing a head, but if a tail is drawn, that completes the snake and a new snake must be 'started' by drawing another head card. Unusable cards are discarded and are shuffled once the draw pile has been exhausted. The winner is the player who has made the most snakes or, as an alternative, the player who has made the longest snake.&#10;&#10;The slightly more difficult game only uses the four snakes with nine parts. A single child can probably have fun just making snakes, perhaps consisting of a head, 40 body parts and a tail.&#10;&#10;",

Three groups of scenarios (Gulfs and Straits, Coastal Seas, Open Ocean) depict likely places of conflict and participants. Silhouette type counters cover the major combatants of over a dozen nations. Back printing has been used to conceal a unit&rsquo;s identity and attack values. Surface effect ships and semi-submerged platforms depict future naval trends. Ranged attacks, air detection zones, NTDS, and&#10;optional rules covering weather in all the world&rsquo;s oceans and systems reliability allow players to realistically simulate modern naval combat.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The designer noted: &quot;This one was supposed to be the simple game of the three for that year. It was, and was perhaps too simple. With only air and surface elements represented, it was a clean and fast game of modern naval combat, but not the full story. It was fast and violent though, and sold out quickly. We redid the concept (much more to my satisfaction) some years later with Battle Stations.&quot;&#10;&#10;Raketny Kreyser is the rarest of the Simulation Canada board games; only 550 were printed.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 12 minutes&#10;Hex: 1 nautical mile / 1.8 kilometers&#10;Units: Individual ships or three aircraft&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 18&quot; featureless blue mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (255 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12-page Raketny Kreyser rules booklet (5.5&quot;x8.5&quot;)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The decisive battles around Arracourt commenced on 15 September 1944 when elements of the German 15th Panzer Grenadier Division clashed with the reconnaissance units of the USA 2nd Cavalry Group. After initially withdrawing, the Germans again advanced near the town of Luneville, with the 111th Panzer Brigade committed as reinforcements.&#10;&#10;Caen was the objective of the British 3rd Infantry Division on D-Day due to its position on the Orne River and its roll as a road hub for the area.

The player to move the final piece into the 9th box (Home) is the winner.&#10;&#10;From Gladstone&rsquo;s Games to Go:&#10;&#10;Part of the appeal of Sliders is the strange sense of ritual at the beginning of the game.  Secret numbers are scrawled, then revealed, and finally, a miniature landscape of towers is constructed.  If you play in public, casual observers will first be mystified, then drawn to you.

The ground scale is 1 inch equals fifteen yards. There is no specific time scale per turn.&#10;&#10;Protz' rules provide a great deal of flavor to the period of Cavaliers and Roundheads. The foot (infantry) regiments, which combine pikemen and musketeers, are arranged in a logical way that allows for easy use of the two types within the same unit. The foot can assume a number of specified &quot;postures&quot; or formations that affect their fighting ability against certain opponents. For example, foot in &quot;close order&quot; or &quot;ring&quot; fight better against opposing horse (cavalry).&#10;&#10;The horse also has specified postures, such as the caracole, which is a deep formation intended to attack by firing pistols in successive ranks. Horse also has a unique movement restriction where they must move by one of three speeds: trot, canter, or gallop. The horse must accelerate turn-by-turn to get up to galloping speed. The speed makes a great deal of difference when fighting other horse. The faster troops have the advantage. This is a nice touch and provides a game mechanic for a situation that is often mentioned in accounts of the era.&#10;&#10;Some of the game's mechanics are cumbersome. For example, &quot;Giving fire with small arms&quot; requires nine steps; firing artillery requires 10 steps. However, these rules are still very playable. The second edition (published 1976) adds several pages of rules for siege warfare as well as clarifications and revisions of first edition rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Charles Grant's The War Game is a classic set of rules for &quot;old school&quot; miniature wargaming. The rules first appeared as a series of articles in Tradition magazine, a UK production aimed at painters of miniature soldiers. The published version is a 191-page hardcover book.&#10;&#10;The era covered by the rules is vaguely the Seven Years War, generally known as the &quot;Horse and Musket&quot; era. One interesting feature of the game is that rather than strictly portray the historical era, The War Game invites creating fictional armies of the period so players can give their own grandiloquent names to their units and paint them using their own uniform designs.&#10;&#10;The scales used for the game are pretty fuzzy. The miniatures are used singly, i.e., not mounted in multiples on a base as in most miniature wargames. An infantry brigade of two regiments is roughly 100 single figures. Maneuvering your units can be tedious, but it's easy to adopt any formation.&#10;&#10;The War Game not only provides a set of rules, but each chapter provides a great deal of philosophy behind the rule with the actual game mechanics stated simply at the end. For example, the actual rules for moving infantry are very simple, but Grant takes four pages, with a lot of reasoning and reference to historical sources, to come to them.&#10;&#10;The War Game is far from concise. However, it's not just a set of rules, it's a great read from one of miniature wargaming's founders.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Great War is a set of miniature wargame rules for the first months of World War One. The nature of the war at that time was very fluid and hadn't settled into the static trench warfare that characterized the war in modern memory.&#10;&#10;The basic units of the game are the infantry company, cavalry squadron, and half-battery. These basic units are combined into larger units such as battalions, regiments, brigades, and batteries. There are no set scales for distance or time.&#10;&#10;Great War uses increment cards that determine how many actions a player can make in their turn. Cards number from one to three. The composition of a card deck varies by nationality, but is always eight cards. Countries rated to have better command control will have more &quot;3s&quot; in their deck and a higher total of increments. The cards are drawn each turn and reshuffled after the deck has been gone through.&#10;&#10;Command control is simulated by a commander having to allocate command factors to every unit he wishes to move or fire in the turn. When the game starts, the commander has one command factor available per unit. However, as units lose or win melees, capture key positions, or rout, the command factors will rise and fall so that a commander may be unable to move all his units in a turn. The commander MUST allocate command factors to attempt to unpin any units that have become pinned due to enemy fire.&#10;&#10;Firing uses an incremental percentage. A unit has a base percentage value for their fire, which is multiplied by the number of figures firing and then by the number of increments. For example, a rifle company of six figures firing at long range (15&quot;) for two increments has a base factor of 10%, which is multiplied times the figures to get 60%, and then multiplied by the number of increments for a result of 120% or one casualty inflicted and a 20% chance for a second. Cover modifiers may also reduce a unit's fire. For example, if the target of the rifle company's fire had been entrenched, the fire would be reduced to 1/4 for a result of a 30% chance for a single casualty.&#10;&#10;Small arms fire is from unit to unit, but artillery fire uses templates that cover a larger area and may embrace multiple target units, all of which are affected by the fire. Casualties can mount rapidly, especially when artillery fire comes into play.&#10;&#10;Infantry, cavalry, artillery--and machine guns--are the dominant arms in Great War, but early armored vehicles, such as armored cars, were on hand and are included in the game.&#10;&#10;Great War includes organization charts for all the countries of 1914 along with guidelines for basing figures and models.&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly even with a large number of units per side. There is enough &quot;flavor&quot; to make the rules engaging without so much detail that one feels bogged down in minutiae.&#10;&#10;",

Payout! is a &ldquo;race to the end&rdquo; board game. You start the game with 20 cents. There are 6 different types of spaces on the board. Each type corresponds to a vault. If you land on a vault with coins in it, you get the coins that are in the vault. If you land on a space without coins in it, you have to put coins in the vault. When you get to the end of the board, you get to sit in a vault and take all of the coins that go in it. If you have the most money at the end of the game, you win.&#10;&#10;Payout! is a game for three to six players, although you can play it with two if you really want to. Payout! uses two dice, loose change, pawns, and a custom board. You can download the custom board and read the rules at http://www.invisible-city.com/play/477. A four-player game takes about 30 minutes to play. Payout! is appropriate for ages 7 and up, and is a great way to reinforce basic counting and money skills with younger children.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rules for wargames in the Early Medieval Period, 100 -1300 A.D. These rules borrow many of their mechanisms from the Wargames Research Ancients rules. The scale is 1 figure equals 20 men, one inch equals ten yards, and one turn equals approximately 30 seconds of elapsed time.&#10;&#10;Troop types are classified by armor protection, formation, social order and experience, and weapons. For example, an 11th century Norman knight would be classified as HC (heavy cavalry), Order (slightly loose formation), K (knights, very high on the social/experience scale), and light lance (used overarm, not couched).&#10;&#10;One interesting aspect of the rules is that it includes a section of guidelines for modifying troop performance based on campaign factors. For example, if troops have force marched, been previously defeated by their opponent, are out of supply, they will suffer minus factors to their die rolls for testing morale, missile fire, and melee resolution.&#10;&#10;The rules include four pages of army lists that provide sample ratings for troop types by nationality.&#10;&#10;Despite being almost 40 years old, God's Acre is still a good game system based on solid &quot;Old School&quot; mechanics for miniature gaming.&#10;&#10;",
