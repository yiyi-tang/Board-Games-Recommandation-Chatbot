This area was at the southern edge of greater Stalingrad, with a large leather factory along its north side. In the game, the player (Germans) tries to capture objective hexes and headquarter locations from the Russians (played by the game system).&#10;&#10;The game uses a solitaire system that reflects the historical situation but includes enough variability and uncertainty to enhance the fog of war feeling to foster replayability. The standard game is suitable for novice wargamers. There are advanced optional rules presented that contain rules that may be &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; as desired to the standard game, to provide a more detailed and challenging game for veteran players. Designed by Gary Graber.&#10;&#10;Tactical, company-level, 300 yard hexes, 100 counters, 8.5&quot;x11&quot; color map, 16-page instructions, designed specifically for solitaire play, stresses high playability and historicity.  The game puts you in command of elements of the German 29th Division, pushing towards the Volga.&#10;&#10;This second edition offers newly revised rules, optional rules, and components.&#10;&#10;&#10;1st edition description&#10;&#10;This is a solitaire design based on the early September, 1942 German assault on Kuporosnoye at the far south of Stalingrad.  The player controls the German 29th Division, and the game system handles the Russian 35th Guards Division defenders.  The game includes 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cardstock map, set of uncut, color unit counters, and full rules.  This game is presented as a simple &quot;standard game&quot; suitable for novices, to which several advanced options can be added.  The game stresses &quot;uncertainty&quot; for the solitaire wargamer, which is provided by hidden Russian units, random reinforcements, variable &quot;daily orders&quot; from HQ, and imprecise victory conditions.

    "Description": "During his work at the Operations Research Office, the physicist George Gamow invented a simple war game to be played by analysts. The game is played with three identical boards, one for each of the players and one for a referee.&#10;The board &hellip; represents a tank battlefield by a lattice of hexagons, &hellip; some of which are hatched to represent wooded areas of low visibility. The white hexagons represent open fields, and the size of a hexagon represents the &ldquo;radius of action&rdquo; of a tank in battle.&#10;Each player starts with ten markers representing tanks at his back line, and &ldquo;a move&rdquo; consists in displacing any number of tanks into any of the adjacent hexagons. Each player sees his board only and must infer from the play where his opponent&rsquo;s tanks are located.&#10;(from the rules)&#10;&#10;Get the full game: https://grognard.com/download/games/board/tankgame.pdf&#10;&#10;",

These armies are manouvered around the 17 regions of the map of Italy in a simple I go - You go framework, undertaking different actions including ravaging (for the Carthaginians) and combat.&#10;&#10;The combat rules are straightforward and simple with a few interesting tweaks such as ambushes. In many cases conflict is restricted to skirmishing between the forces but  chance may cause a larger battle to occur. The Romans have to strike a balance between not risking having their armies utterly destroyed in battle by the wily Hannibal whilst not allowing the empire to become demoralised if the Carthaginians are allowed to ravage the land unimpeded.&#10;&#10;The game, given to Society of Ancients members as part of their subscription in 2008, consists of a 20 page A4 rule-book with colour covers, a simple but adequate map and 36 counters which you need to cut out yourself.&#10;&#10;",

Although many mysteries surround K'uhul, it has remained fairly harmless over the past 1000 years.&#10;&#10;Now two rival shamans have arrived to worship at the sacred site and discover that they are in violent disagreement over the origins and purpose of K'uhul. The only thing they agree on is that K'uhul is a gate to untold power.&#10;&#10;As their increasingly heated arguments begin to disrupt the local village--the village Head Man decides to end the bickering by holding a contest: the first shaman to be able to successfully activate the power of K'uhul will win the respect and riches of the village, while the loser will be sacrificed to appease Coatlicue--who is no doubt annoyed by the constant bickering.&#10;&#10;The contest is held on a 3x3 grid within the ring of sacred statues. The ring of statues is formed by making piles of &quot;gate chips&quot; which surround 9 single chips which form the gate itself. The gate chips come in two styles, Runes and Stars, and the 3x3 pattern they form must be manipulated to match that of one of the special &quot;gate cards&quot;. By arranging the chips to match the pattern of a gate card, a shaman can &quot;unlock&quot; the gate.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is further complicated by the presence of several types of &quot;special&quot; chips as well as &quot;spell&quot; cards that are activated when a gate card is &quot;unlocked&quot;.&#10;&#10;The first player to successfully &quot;unlock&quot; two of the face-up gate cards PLUS a final gate card from their own hand, will be declared the winner. The loser is then sacrificed during the ensuing celebration to the merriment of all.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shock Army was the name given to the elite fighting units of the Republican 'Ejercito Popular' (The Popular Army).  The game recreates a number of attacks by these spearhead corps.&#10;&#10;Shock Army is designed to be played as a table top game between two players.  No map is included, but there are sufficient terrain features to fight four major scenarios.&#10;&#10;The game is built around three fundamental concepts.  The first is the importance in battle of an army's command system, that is the way in which its headquarters is organized.  Orders from HQ's are represented by impulse counters.&#10;&#10;The second fundamental concept is that of &quot;fighting power&quot;.  Each unit has a total fighting power factor. In combat opposing forces compare their total fighting power factors - the unit with the higher fighting power factor is the victor.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, every combat unit can move an unlimited distance.  However, the further a unit moves in one go, the lower its fighting power will fall.  This represents the breakdown of cohesion in a unit if it is pushed too far, too quickly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A regular Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;This small expansion set Anno Domini - Probespiel was a free giveaway by the publisher. It only contains about 8-15 event cards without a common theme. Since this is not enough for a real game, it only comes with a brief summary of the gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly. Anno Domini is a blast to play, it is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;Contained as a free bonus in this German version of Such a Thing?, this German version of Zooloretto and this German version of Airlines Europe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from their website)&#10;&#10;Calling All Race Fans&#10;CATCH THE EXCITEMENT OF &quot;BIG TIME AUTO RACING&quot;!&#10;&#10;If you love stock car racing, you must play Speedway Racing's board game. The Speedway Racing  board game gives you 'big time stock car auto racing' and 'live event track action' for true, behind the wheel racing experiences.&#10;&#10;At the Drivers Meeting, you will receive your Drivers Handbook and will learn the rules of the race.&#10;With one to five drivers, choose your favorite car, then 'start your engines'. Drivers race their cars around the oval track based on a roll of the dice. There are Bonus Points in the game. If you are lucky enough to roll doubles or other combinations imprinted, on the Speedway Racing game board, you will accelerate your advancement around the track.&#10;&#10;During the Driver's meeting, you also learn that this will be a fast paced, five-lap competition. You will be driving against other highly competitive opponents. There are many Challenges and Pitfalls ahead of you as you speed around the track to take your car, to the coveted &quot;Winner Circle&quot;, of Speedway Racing's board game.&#10;&#10;Before you begin, choose Option 1, for the first driver to cross the finish line. Or, Option 2, in case all drivers are 'stacked up' and trying to cross the finish line. One last roll of the dice will determine the winner. You must choose Option 1 or Option 2, before the race begins.&#10;&#10;The Race is Underway! Of course, the object of the game is to win the race, but beware; there are advantages and obstacles as you thunder around the track.&#10;&#10;Hit the &quot;Pit Stop&quot; Zone or the &quot;Speedway Challenge&quot; Zone and adjust your position based on the events of each opportunity. Hit the wall and you suffer the consequences, in your quest. If you can avoid an accident, you will advance your position on the track.&#10;&#10;Take care in selecting your pit crew. Many track advantages will depend on the timing, action and reaction speed of your pit crew.A driver can pilot the race car, but the pit crew will make the crucial difference in the outcome of the victory.&#10;    &#10;As in real speedway racing, your pit crew is vital! The Speedway Racing Board Game track graphics are beautifully illustrated. The game's race cars are authentic 1:144 scale die-cast metal with moving wheels.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Challenge&quot; cards and &quot;Pit Stop&quot; cards are&#10;realistic 'during the race' events. As you position your car and maneuver around the track, you will encounter cars hitting the wall, track debris, flat tires and yellow flags.&#10;&#10;Caution Flags Are Out! Beware of Hazards!!&#10;&#10;White-knuckle rookie drivers could hit the car in front of them, have stalled engines or make serious driving errors, while lapped traffic slows you down. The events of the &quot;Speedway Racing&quot; board game will impact the sheer adrenaline rush of moving forward, as you concentrate, on the coveted first place win. As you cross the Finish Line, move your car into the &quot;Winner's Circle&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each game contains a highly detailed graphic game board, five 1:144 scale die-cast cars with moving wheels, drivers challenge cards, dice and directions, in a re-usable bag. Family board game enthusiasts may want to have multiple games for their weekly or monthly family board game night.&#10;&#10;The rules, of this family board game, are easy enough for the youngest race fans, but challenging enough, to keep you and the other drivers ever watchful on the track.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DementalismAlright, smarty buns, here's your chance to show everyone how smart your brain is. Due to the continuing idiocy of you and your fellow security guards a whole bunch of clones have escaped from the Primordial Soup Kitchen and are now wandering the various countrysides of Mutha Oith. You guys better get your wazoos in gear and recapture them before your bosses find out and you lose your jobs.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;ll take all of your brains, half your luck, two thirds of your charm, a bunch of guts, and a pinch of divine inspiration to survive this fast-paced and exciting original card game by award winning illustrator and game designer Andy Hopp.&#10;&#10;Peeps: 2-12&#10;Ages: 8+&#10;Durations: 30-60 minutes&#10;Contents: 128 cards, instructions, setup card, sticker&#10;&#10;The Gist of the Thing&#10;&#10;Security at the Primordial Soup Kitchen, that ridiculously wondrous and mythical repository of Oith&rsquo;s genetic legacy, has been lax of late, to say the least. Following an insane night of fermented circuspi nut binging, impromptu (and painful) interior redecorating, and decidedly unsexy pillow fighting between you and your fellow guards you awoke from a grog-addled stupor to discover someone left the goosin&rsquo; doors open. Again.&#10;&#10;It wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing under normal circumstances, but a while back the honchos decided it would be a good idea to start stockpiling clones of various important denizens of Oith (and some unimportant ones for practice). You know, in case of calamity or somesuch. Well, thanks to you and your cronies, these clones (three of each!) are now wandering the countryside, clueless and confused.&#10;&#10;You guys should probably get your wazoos in gear and nab those hapless triplicates before they fall into the Keister of Gawd or get eaten by something. Oh, and whoever finds the most denizens doesn&rsquo;t get fired or fed to anything.&#10;&#10;The Beginning&#10;&#10;Step 1: Gather unto thee a bunch of friends. Arrange them around a table or some other suitable playing surface.&#10;&#10;Step 2: Take all the cards and shuffle them up really well. Then lay some of them face-down on the table in a grid 8 cards wide and 8 cards long. If your table is too small you can use a smaller grid (6 cards x 6 cards, for example). This is called the SPREAD.&#10;&#10;Make sure each player has enough table space in front of him or her to lay a row of several cards side by side. This space, the STORE, will eventually be used to house the player&rsquo;s STACKS (the cards a player collects throughout the game). Also, designate a spot somewhere on the table for the KEISTER OF GAWD (the discard pile). Set the rest of the cards facedown in a pile known heretofore as the HEAP.&#10;&#10;Step 3: Read the rest of the rules.&#10;&#10;Useful Terms&#10;&#10;Cards: There are three different types of cards a peep will encounter:&#10;&#10;Denizens represent the various peeps that escaped from the Primordial Soup Kitchen. The Spread contains three of each Denizen.&#10;&#10;Giggities have the zazzy ability to copy the traits of other organisms. Thusly, they can form a Stack with any Denizen.&#10;&#10;Turmoil Cards represent assorted events, catastrophes and phenomena that affect the game in various ways. Sometimes they&rsquo;re good, sometimes they&rsquo;re not.&#10;&#10;Denizen Power: A special ability granted by a Safe Stack. A player may only use one Denizen Power each turn.&#10;&#10;Flip: To turn a card face-up.&#10;&#10;The Heap: The draw pile.&#10;&#10;The Keister of Gawd: The Discard Pile.&#10;&#10;Nab: To steal a Stack.&#10;&#10;Reveal: To turn a Stack face-up. Revealed Stacks stay that way until the end of the current player&rsquo;s turn, unless otherwise denoted.&#10;&#10;Peek: To look at a Stack or card without revealing it to the others.&#10;&#10;The Spread: The face-down grid of cards that forms the primary playing area.&#10;&#10;Stacks: Matching cards collected throughout the game. Three types of Stacks exist. Each is worth a different amount of points.&#10;&#10;Sneaky Stack (1 point):A Denizen and a Giggity.&#10;&#10;Stacked Stack (2 points): Two identical Denizens.&#10;&#10;Safe Stack (4 points): Three of the same Denizen. A Safe Stack can NEVER be discarded or nabbed by another player. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called a Safe Stack.&#10;&#10;The Store: The area directly in front of each player that houses the Stacks the player has collected. Stacks in the Store are always laid from left to right in the order they were collected. Sneaky Stacks and Stacked Stacks are laid face-down, while Safe Stacks are face-up.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;The most flatulent player (by consensus) goes first. Here&rsquo;s what you do on your turn:&#10;&#10;Step 1: Flip over any one card in the Spread. If it&rsquo;s a Turmoil card do what it says. If it&rsquo;s a Giggity or Denizen leave it in place face-up (unless you can make a match with the Denizen).&#10;&#10;Step 2: Flip over a second card. If it is a Turmoil card do what it says. If it&rsquo;s a Denizen or a Giggity you have options:&#10;&#10;Two Giggities: If both of the flipped cards are Giggities toss them both in the Keister of Gawd.&#10;&#10;One Giggity &amp; One Denizen: If one of the revealed cards is a Denizen that matches a Denizen in one of your Sneaky or Stacked Stacks you may snatch it up and insert it into the matching Stack. Adding a card to a Sneaky Stack makes it a Stacked Stack. Discard the Giggity into the Keister of Gawd. Adding a Card to a Stacked Stack makes it a Safe Stack. You may now flip it over. It can&rsquo;t be stolen and you immediately have access to that Denizen&rsquo;s Power (you can still only use one Denizen Power per turn, though).&#10;&#10;If one of the revealed cards is a Denizen and the other is a Giggity you may snatch them both up and create a Sneaky Stack.&#10;&#10;If one or more of the cards is a Denizen and you think you know where another player has a Stack that matches that Denizen you may try to steal the Stack from the other player. Point to the face-down stack in front of the other player and demand to see it. The player flips over the stack, revealing it to everyone. If you are correct, and the Denizen in the Stack matches the one you flipped, you Nab the Stack from the other player and add it to your Store. If you are incorrect, your turn ends immediately and you LOSE YOUR NEXT TURN. The owner of the wronged stack flips it back over and play continues.&#10;&#10;Two Different Denizens: If both cards are Denizens who don&rsquo;t match each other and you don&rsquo;t know where a matching stack is, flip both cards back over and play passes to the next player. If one or more of the revealed cards is a Denizen that matches a Denizen in one of your Sneaky or Stacked Stacks you may snatch it up and insert it into the matching Stack (discarding the Giggity to make a Stacked Stack or combining three Denizens to make a Safe Stack.&#10;&#10;Two Identical Denizens: If you flip two of the same Denizen you may combine them into a Stacked Stack and place it in your Store. If you already have a Sneaky Stack featuring the same Denizen you may discard the Giggity from the Sneaky Stack and combine the Denizen with the Stacked Stack to form a Safe Stack.&#10;&#10;If you suspect another player has a Sneaky Stack featuring the flipped Denizen you may attempt to nab it as described in the previous section.&#10;&#10;Step 3: Used Turmoil cards go to the Keister. Unmatched or undiscarded Giggities get flipped back over. Fill in any gaps in the Spread with face-down cards from the Heap. Once the Heap is depleted just leave the gaps empty.&#10;&#10;Step 4: Your turn is over. Play progresses clockwise around the table unless a Turmoil card or Denizen Power indicates otherwise.&#10;&#10;Sidenote:  You may look at the Stacks in your own Store whenever you want, but if you do you must temporarily flip them over for everyone to see.&#10;&#10;Denizen Powers&#10;&#10;No doubt the observant among you have noticed a block of text at the bottom of each Denizen card. This describes the special power you can access once you have that Denizen in a Safe Stack (all three matching Denizen cards).&#10;&#10;Each turn, once you&rsquo;ve acquired one or more Safe Stacks, you may choose to initiate the power from ONE Denizen. You may activate the power at any point during your turn, but you can only use one Denizen Power per turn and you may not use the same Denizen Power two turns in a row (even if you only have one Safe Stack).&#10;&#10;As soon as you get a Safe Stack you can access that Denizen&rsquo;s Power (as long as it&rsquo;s your turn and you haven&rsquo;t already used a Denizen power that turn). Some Denizen Powers are activated by the actions of other players and can be used whether it&rsquo;s your turn or not, as long as you haven&rsquo;t already used one that turn (such as Squiggins Neverlost&rsquo;s ability to avoid lost turns).&#10;When you activate a Denizen Power turn the relevant Safe Stack the other way around (but still face-up) to signify its usage. Turn it back around at the start of your next turn.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;Once the Spread has been depleted and all the cards are either in the Stores or the Keister of Gawd, the game is over. Whoever has the most points, determined by the type and number of Stacks in each player&rsquo;s Store, is the winner and gets to keep his or her job as a hapless minion of the Primordial Soup Kitchen. Everyone else gets fired or fed to something horrible.&#10;&#10;In the event of a tie, whichever tieing player has the most Safe Stacks wins. If it&rsquo;s still a tie the win goes to the player with the most Stacked Stacks, then the most Sneaky Stacks. If it&rsquo;s still a tie after that the world blows up and nobody wins.&#10;&#10;Stack Values&#10;&#10;Sneaky Stack (1 Giggity &amp; 1 Denizen): 1 Point&#10;&#10;Stacked Stack (2 Denizens): 2 Points&#10;&#10;Safe Stack (3 Denizens): 4 Points&#10;&#10;&nbsp;&#10;&#10;",
