    "Description": "Nine Lives is a Rogue-Like Roll-and-Write Game&#10;&#10;You are a Cat trying to explore a Dungeon. You only have Nine Lives to explore the Dungeon. Find treasure, upgrade your Cat, and explore the dungeon in order to earn the most points.&#10;&#10;Players: 1 - 100+&#10;Game Time: 20 minutes&#10;Items needed: 6 six-sided dice, one of them being a different color than the other five and one &ldquo;Nine Lives&rdquo; sheet per player&#10;&#10;Setup: Roll 2 d6 to determine the End Goals for the game, mark the End Goals with an X over the die symbol. (Re-roll if necessary until there are two different numbers)&#10;All players will use the same Dungeon Map layout and End Goals. The game is played simultaneously, with players trying to earn the most points. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Determine Starting Point - Roll 2 d6 that are different colors. Use the darker die for determining the columns and the lighter die for determining the rows. Find coordinating locations on the Dungeon Map. Choose one and mark an X on the Dungeon Map to show your starting point for this life. If a 6 is rolled on the die, it is a wild for that row or column, and you may choose any location while still following the other die rolled. If both dice are 6&rsquo;s, you can start at any location on the map. Each player chooses their own starting point following these rules.&#10;&#10;Choose a Cat - Choose a Cat by marking the number of this life in the corner for this run in the dungeon. For the first turn, use the Starter Cat. Following turns, you may choose any cat that has not yet been chosen. In a multiplayer game, each player can choose any Cat they would like for each life.&#10;&#10;Roll 5 Dice - Roll 5 d6 for this Cat&rsquo;s life in the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Assign Dice - For each die, choose to either Upgrade a skill or Move the direction of the dice in the dungeon. Players simultaneously use the 5 dice rolled to move and/or upgrade.&#10;&#10;Repeat these steps for each life of your Cat.&#10;&#10;How Movement Works:&#10;- Orthogonally (Up, Down, Right, Left; North, South, East, West) &#10;- When you enter a new square/room, mark an X on it.&#10;- Your next movement must always follow from the last X you marked this life. &#10;- The die numbers correspond to the direction you may move; 1=North, 2=East, 3=South, 4=West, 5=North OR South, 6=East OR West&#10;- You may only move into a square/room without an X. You may never retrace your steps or go onto a space that you have previously X&rsquo;ed. &#10;- If you enter a square/room with an icon that you have upgraded to, you earn a treasure. Mark an X over one of the Treasure. Each Treasure is worth 2 Victory Points.&#10;- You may X squares/rooms that have icons you have not unlocked yet, you just will not earn that Treasure this game.&#10;- There are &ldquo;Upgrade Arrows&rdquo; throughout the map.   If you ever enter one of these spaces, you immediately mark the next X on any one Upgrade track&#10;&#10;How Upgrading Works:&#10;- There are four skill tracks to advance to upgrade your Cat throughout the game.&#10;- Upgrade from left to right, marking an X in the leftmost empty square corresponding to the die.&#10;- Once a square with an icon in it is X&rsquo;ed, you now have that skill. When entering spaces in the Dungeon Map with that icon, you now earn Treasure.&#10;- Once a skill track has been upgraded 9 times, you unlock a unique ability to use once during each Cat&rsquo;s life. &#10;- Upgrades remain for the entire game.&#10;&#10;End of Game: After you have used your last Cat (9 lives), the game is over. Total your score. Each Treasure earned is worth 2 Victory Points. Earn corresponding Victory Points for each Upgrade unlocked (On each skill track, first unlock is 1 VP, second unlock is an additional 2 VP, third unlock is an additional 3 VP). Total your Victory Points for the two End Goals that were rolled during Setup. The player with the most Victory Points is the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This card game from 1898 by music publisher Theodore Presser was intended to be an educational aid to music students.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 39 cards, which together form the basic chords possible for each of the 13 keys. Each card has a large letter in the middle, representing its note. The key to which that note belongs is in the upper right corner, and the musical symbol for that key (sharps or flats) is in the upper left. The bottom of the card lists all three notes in that key.&#10;&#10;The rules say that the game can be played as a simple set collection game like Authors, but is more interesting with a second set of rules, which it says resemble &quot;Cassino&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of five cards, and five more are dealt face up on the table. In turn, each player must if possible place a card from hand onto the table that matches the key of one of those showing. If unable to place a matching card, he may place any other card on the table. The player who puts the final card in a triad or chord collects all three as a set.&#10;&#10;If no cards remain on the table, the next player puts down any card to start the process over. When any player runs out of cards, one more card is dealt to each player. Once all cards have been played, the player collecting the largest number of sets wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

You can use the reader app for practicing and also when you are only two persons and you need a reader. We have two reader apps. 1. Hyakuninisshu EN : This reader app sings the poems exactly like the Japanese wakas (original poems)which are sung since 400 years. 2. Read Hyakunin Isshu EN: This reader app is read normally. It is easier to understand when it is read normally but the app which is sung sounds more genuine like the original Japanese karuta.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hyakuninisshu English Translated Karuta is an English translated version of the Japanese Karuta using the translation of the original Japanese old poems from the anthology called &quot;Hyakuninisshu&quot;. This edition is the complete version of all 100 cards.&#10;&#10;The game is sometimes described as intellectual martial arts. It is about listening and being extremely focused and fast, just like the Samurai with their swords. Only here you fight with cards instead. The manga and anime and now a movie called &quot;Chihayafuru&quot; is about this game. For Chihayafuru fans, this is the karuta you've been waiting for!&#10;&#10;The game is comprised of two decks of cards, the Reader deck and the Player deck. Cards in the Reader deck contain the whole poems while cards in the Player deck contain only the second part of these poems. To begin the game, a Reader is chosen (or you may opt to use the Reader app) and the players are divided into two teams sitting on opposite sides of the table or play area. The Reader shuffles the Reader deck and the Players mix, split evenly the Player deck between the teams and place them face-up in 3-4 rows in front of them. The Reader will read the complete poem on the reading cards and the player that finds the matching Playing card first takes that card and puts it aside. If the card taken was on your opponent's side, you must give one card from your side to your opponent. The first team that has no cards left on their side is the winner (you must get rid of all your cards first, to win).&#10;&#10;The game is set in Japan during the Genpei war (1180-1185). In order to win the war, you need a strategy. Place the cards you are familiar with close to you (in the beginning it is normal that none of the cards are familiar). If you know what cards your opponent is familiar with, place those cards as far as possible from them inside the playing field. Since the reader or app will always read the complete quotation, you do not need prior knowledge of the poems. Strategically place the playing cards in a way that you can find and take them quickly such as laying them alphabetically or categorize them under the same first words.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It has been written that &ldquo;The road to hell is paved with good intentions.&rdquo; However, that road to hell (or heaven) first leads to limbo. In this game you and a friend are full of good intentions, and abstractly perform good deeds &ndash; both big and small &ndash; throughout your lives. Some turn out poorly, however, so you will have to travel the limbo road. At the end of the journey, only one of you can win the game and move on.&#10;&#10;Both players will use cards to move along Limbo Road, along with a few special cards to help their cause or hinder their opponent. They'll collect colored Good Deed tiles which may provide victory points, and Fate tiles which will provide special actions. Upon reaching limbo the game becomes a bit restricted and players will have to choose their actions more carefully.... This is an easy-playing game with some interesting decisions and, hopefully, decent levels of excitement and fun.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Equipped with the best weaponry that Earth can provide, there are few enemies that can resist them for long.&#10;&#10;The United Citizens&rsquo; Federation is in need of such soldiers. Enemies press in on all sides, terrible alien races who seek to dominate the universe and wipe humanity from the galactic map. The Arachnids are but on threat that has reared its head as they sweep through system after system. The Skinnies have also begun to muster their forces and there are rumors of yet more dreadful forces lurking at the edge of known space.&#10;&#10;Humanity needs you! Are you doing your part?&#10;&#10;The Mobile Infantry Army Book contains everything you need to construct a force of troopers capable of defending your world against any aggressor. From power suit platoons to the mighty Marauders, from the latest in Neodog engineering to the amazing TAC UAV, we provide the tools. You just have to supply the talent.&#10;&#10;Mobile Infantry, Ho! &#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The best trained troopers within the Mobile Infantry, it is the role of the Pathfinders to accept and complete the most hazardous missions in the war zone. Equipped with the advanced M-1A6 power suit and taught to take the fight to the Arachnids, Pathfinder platoons can be found in every campaign.&#10;&#10;With squads having easy access to specialists and advanced weaponry, the Pathfinders represent the pinnacle of the Mobile Infantry, the elite. Often fighting far behind enemy lines, Pathfinder platoons may even enter Arachnid tunnel networks in an effort to exterminate the aliens from the galaxy.&#10;&#10;All troopers of the Mobile Infantry have the respect and gratitude of the civilians and citizens of the Federation. Despite the destruction of Buenos Aires that marked the true beginning of the Arachnid War, Earth remains a peaceful and prosperous place and its inhabitants know they have the Mobile Infantry and Mighty Fleet to thank for that. On colony worlds where clashes with the Arachnids come with alarming regularity, support for the military forces of the Federation tends to be much stronger.&#10;&#10;The Pathfinders are a cut above the average trooper, even though few civilians or citizens are aware of their existence. They are the troopers that other troopers respect, the highly trained elite. It is the Pathfinders that reconnoiter important strategic positions behind the Arachnid line. They are the troopers tasked with extracting squads cut off by swarms of warrior bugs or entering bug holes to assassinate a potent brain bug. They are granted the best equipment and training the Federation can provide but in return are expected to complete missions that other forces within the Mobile Infantry would deem suicidal.&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;&#10;     Army List: A complete army list for Pathfinder platoons, including special rules unique to this elite force.&#10;     Painting Guide: Full color pages jam-packed with examples of Pathfinder armies and different paint schemes.&#10;     New Equipment: Complete rules for the new equipment available only to Pathfinder platoons. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The war of the gods did not begin with any formal declaration. No sides were drawn, no single event cascaded into open battle. Instead, it was the slow realization that as devotion to one god waxed, power to the others waned.&#10;&#10;Some thought themselves above the fray, thought themselves wiser, learned, or immune to the whim of mortal man. They were wrong. The gods do not exist without followers, and devotion is their lifeblood, whether they wish it so or not. The tide of cosmic balance had shifted towards mankind, and the gods who once enjoyed their unquestioning deference now have to contend for prominence.&#10;&#10;Thus it was that the last holdouts who sought to distance themselves from the fray took to the battlefield in their own bids for dominance. What had begun as jostling in a minor power struggle had drawn in all the mightiest deities across the Egyptian pantheon.&#10;&#10;In the end, there could be only one.&#10;&#10;The Pantheon expansion introduces a whole new set of five Egyptian gods, each bringing their own abilities and warriors to the fight against oblivion. The introduction of each new god into the game not only gives new options to the player who controls them, but also changes the landscape for everyone on the table. New strategies and dynamics arise as different mixes of gods are pitted against each other, and the Pantheon expansion increases these combinations exponentially!&#10;&#10;The Pantheon expansion comes with:&#10;&#10;5 God figures and 30 Warrior figures:&#10;       -  1 Horus God figure and 6 Horus Warrior figures&#10;       -  1 Hathor God figure and 6 Hathor Warrior figures&#10;       -  1 Set God figure and 6 Set Warrior figures&#10;       -  1 Thoth God figure and 6 Thoth Warrior figures&#10;       -  1 Bastet God figure and 6 Bastet Warrior figures&#10;5 God dashboards&#10;5 Joined God dashboards&#10;30 Battle cards (6 for each God)&#10;20 Color bases (4 for each God)&#10;80 Ankh tokens (16 for each God)&#10;&#10;Additionally, acquired in the Kickstarter campaign, you also get 5 Kickstarter Exclusive bonus plastic components: 3 sculpted Bastet Cat tokens and 2 engraved Eye of Horus tokens.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Grandpa, can you tell again the story of when all the toilet paper in the world disappeared?&quot; The old man's face closed, stripped of his usual smile. And, as he pulled the children into his lap, all those memories kept within him, closed by the invisible key of the passage of time, began to flow. His voice sounded calm and painful. &ldquo;In that strange period of our lives, there were a number of people who, without reason, decided to use up all the toilet paper in the world. These people were part of a radical terrorist movement called P.O.O.H., which basically meant the Party of the Organized and Obsessive Hoarders.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;PAPER ROLL &amp; Write is a roll &amp; write game, for 2 players. One of the players takes command of the Party of the Organized and Obsessive Hoarders (hereinafter referred to as P.O.O.H.), whose aim is to try to deplete the toilet paper stock in the stores, leading the population to total panic. The other player assumes the role of Coordinator of a group of specialists called by the government to resolve this crisis, ensuring the production and supply of paper to the city.&#10;&#10;In each round, the P.O.O.H rolls a certain number of dice. Then, the Coordinator chooses how many dice will be used during that round by BOTH players. For each dice that he decides not to use during that round, panic increases by 1.  The more dice the Coordinator choses, the more dice he and the P.O.O.H. will use. The more dice he choses not to use, the more the panic increases.&#10;The Coordinator will use dice to produce and distribute paper across stores, while P.O.O.H will use the same dice to accumulate bonuses in his headquarters and to visit stores on the map, buying all the paper and spread the panic, while avoiding being slowed down by the police.&#10;&#10;The Coordinator wins the game if at least 5 stores are supplied with paper. &#10;The P.O.O.H. wins the game if the panic reaches the end of the panic track.&#10;&#10;In the end of each round, players exchange the game sheets they have in their possession. This creates a constant back and forth between players, because the sheet that one player is currently using, will be used by the other player in the next round.&#10;&#10;Also, the Coordinator and the POOH play two completely different types of games, which highly increases replayability.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;PAPER ROLL &amp; write is a free Print &amp; Play Roll &amp; Write board game for two players. But for us it is more than a game, it is a cheerful and positive manifesto in times of uncertainty, and a joint effort from 3 designers in Lockdown due to Covid-19.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Broken Crown is an epic Kingdom Building strategy game for 2-5 players set in the world of Orv&aelig;n; a land rich with history and culture that still aches from the scars of recent war. Players act as a noble of their unique homeland to rebuild their nation&rsquo;s glory and restore the Crown.&#10;&#10;Each play of Broken Crown is different from the next. The game uses elements of Euro-Style trading games along with direct player conflict to create a dynamic, ever-changing experience. Players win the game by achieving the most Glory points at the game&rsquo;s end. Each game is played over a number of Years, each year being split in to 3 turns referred to as Seasons. As the seasons pass, event cards will be revealed that will affect all nations, and players will have to adapt in order to maintain their place in the Kingdom. &#10;During the Market Phase players may recruit famed Champions, each with their own story and deep interwoven family history. They may purchase land deeds and ancient relics by bidding in the central Marketplace. These cards may be placed on their Realm Boards to build their own unique economies and armies.&#10;&#10;In the Battle Phase, each player will secretly choose from their battle cards to maintain peace, attack another player&rsquo;s realm or assist others in their efforts.&#10;&#10;How well players fare in Orv&aelig;n depends not just on their economic&nbsp;or military skill, but their ability to negotiate and lead. Broken Crown allows for free trade and deal making between players for resources and assistance. Some players will choose to become warlords, seeking to dominate others in their pursuit of glory. Some will be peacekeepers of the land, earning their title as a respected leader of the people.&#10;&#10;Build your Realm &bull; Unite the Nations &bull; Mend The Crown&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the 3rd installment in the scenario campaign series Fields of Battle. &#10;Berlin Race to the Reichstag includes 16 platoon level/small unit skirmish scenarios, campaign decisions, a bonus multi-player &quot;big battle&quot; scenario, and a short tutorial on terrain, all centered in 1945 and the defense of Berlin. &#10;Disposable Heroes is needed for referenced information in this Scenario Book.&#10;&#10;On April 22, 1945 General Helmuth Weidling received a direct telephone call from the Fu&uml;hrerbunker in Berlin. For disobeying Hitler&rsquo;s express order not to withdraw the LVI Panzer Corps in the face of certain annihilation, Weidling was told over the telephone that he had been condemned to death by firing squad. Instead of attempting to avoid his execution by escape or suicide, Weidling drove to Berlin and walked into the Fu&uml;hrerbunker. Adolf Hitler, so impressed by his general&rsquo;s courage, not only canceled the firing squad&mdash;he ordered 53-year old Helmuth Weidling to take command of Berlin&rsquo;s defenses.2 &ldquo;You might just as well have me shot,&rdquo; Weidling remarked dryly to a staff orderly. As Berlin&rsquo;s newest commandant&mdash;the previous three had each been sacked by Hitler&mdash;Weidling faced insurmountable challenges. He lacked manpower and even the most basic supplies, such as food and small arms ammunition. Berlin also lacked proper defensive fortifications and to complicate the situation further, Hitler&rsquo;s adamant refusal to evacuate non-combatants meant that key military bastions&mdash;like the impregnable Zoo flak tower&mdash;were clogged with thousands of panicked civilians. But Weidling&rsquo;s greatest challenge loomed farther east. The Red Army.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The plan called for use of some 34,600 Allied airborne infantry, the Market, to provide the blanket for armored forces, the Garden, to roll forward on as they advanced into Germany in what is known as the largest airborne battle in history. The First Allied Airborne Army under tactical command by General Browning was composed of British, American, and Polish troops who would be dropped ahead of the land based armored advance of British XXX Corps to secure key bridges along a route known as the Corridor through the Netherlands to the Rhine. General Brian Horrocks, the commander of XXX Corps likened the operation to threading a series of needles as each bridge is secured and passed with the last bridge being the most essential to it&rsquo;s success. This last bridge was Arnhem and was tasked to the British 1st Airborne Division to hold for an estimated 48 hours till XXX Corps could link up with them. This was an operation that was more dependent on fortune than the men partaking it could imagine.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Most of the squares show pieces of a knight's equipment, while the rest have various animals or objects as well as a wizard (3-3).&#10;&#10;The rules say that all players should start by putting 24 Marks into the pot(the middle of the board). Players take turns rolling and must follow the instructions for the space showing their die roll. These either allow the player to take that amount from the pot or pay that much into the pot.&#10;&#10;The first player to roll a double six takes the whole pot and ends the game. If there is nothing left in the pot when a double six is rolled, all players have to throw in half the original bet, which goes to the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Floating Castles are miniature wargame rules to simulate naval warfare during the 1860-1885 period.&#10;&#10;The rules cater for any scale with distances measured in yards and speed in knots, converted into inches or fractions.&#10;&#10;You'll need D10's as the rules are based around percentage rolls for most outcomes.&#10;&#10;The sequence of play is straightforward and is based on alternate moves, with each player moving one ship at a time based on an initiative roll. Shooting is simultaneous but torpedoes and ram attacks have their own placing in the sequence.&#10;&#10;There are rules for weather and stability, with a die roll at the start of the game to determine the conditions of play.&#10;&#10;Movement is measured in inches, with variable maneuverability depending upon the speed and size of ships involved.&#10;&#10;Shooting is determined after movement has taken place. All shooting depends upon arcs of fire although, once again, there are no templates provided. If a target is in range and inside a firing arc at the end of the movement phase, it can be fired upon.&#10;&#10;To hit a target, a D10 is rolled for each gun requiring a base 'to hit' score depending upon range. There are, in a addition, a small number of +1 modifiers for sea state, angle of fire etc.&#10;&#10;If a hit is scored, a percentile roll is made to detemine damage, with various hit locations and effects. Armour penetration is dealt with by averaging out the actual armour protection of a target across the whole ship, with each vessel classified as either light, medium, heavy or super heavy. Armour penetration depends upon a D10 roll based on the weapon fired and the strength of the armour, modified by range.&#10;&#10;There are additional straightforward rules for spar, locomotive and towed torpeodoes, mines, ramming and boarding. These are dealt with after the movement and shooting phases have been resolved.&#10;&#10;At the end of the rulebook there are 13 comprehensive page of data tables for virtually every fleet that you might wish to deploy, with stats for both minor nations and the major powers. There are also details of the formulae used to calculate the stats for each ship, so you can always fill in the blanks for those vessels that aren't listed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hexpionage is an approachable yet intense two-player strategy board game that plays in under an hour. Deploy Agents, gather Intel, and sabotage opponents in this game of tension, strategy, and luck. Hexpionage combines hexagons with the thrill of espionage to create a satisfying abstract strategy game to feud over.&#10;&#10;Hexpionage is easy to learn but difficult to master. You can learn the 3 pages of rules in less than 10 minutes, but with endless combinations of agents and board that never stops evolving, it offers a surprising depth of strategy.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to acquire intel but you'll have to strike a careful balance as intel can also be used to activate the different agent's special abilities. You'll also have to watch out for Honeypots and other dangers as the board changes from turn to turn.&#10;&#10;",

In the game of Lobbyist - Shaping the Vote, players get to try their hand at lobbying, working to influence politicians to vote their desired way while competing with other lobbyist who are working towards a different means and outcome.&#10;&#10;Lobbyist - Shaping the Vote is a game where players take on the role of Lobbyist trying to influence the political committee to voting in their desired way. Each player is a lobbyist starting with $50,000. The board is a political committee voting on five issues, Education, Health and Welfare, Infrastructure, Taxes and Revenue, Crime and Punishment. Each issue's influence is represented by a dice value and Lobbyist play cards from their hand to increase and decrease those dice values. Around the board will be 5,7,or 9 (depending on difficulty of play) unique politicians, all with a voting position value for each of the five issues. Politicians will not vote yes until the die values matches or exceeds their voting position values. Each lobbyist it working to gather desired votes on these issues, wanting to gather yes votes on two issues, and no votes on two issues, being indifferent on the fifth issue (each player lobbyist card has different yes/no goals on their cards).&#10;&#10;Throughout the game players will have cards in hand and will draw and play a card on their turn. Most cards will allow then to influence one or more of the voting issue dice. Vote cards are shuffled into the deck and when one of these is drawn the player immediately plays the Vote card and the committee votes on the issues. Prior to voting though the Lobbyist all have one final chance to influence their politicians by either taking a vote action (indicted on the cards), or by spending up to $20,000 of their money to increase or decrease dice values. Once each player has had a chance to take or pass on an action, the politicians vote on the issues and players get yes/no vote tokens for their successful lobbying. Game ends after the fifth vote happens and final scores are tallied.&#10;&#10;I came up with this game idea after sitting through a number of political action committee meetings and hearing the same info numerous times, so I started jotting ideas. The can has been play tested some and everyone I have played with has enjoyed the game at this point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board game for the German TV show&#10;&#10;We are looking for the best innovators and investors - because projects not only have to be assessed, they also have to be sold well! Alternately, the players take on the roles of the candidates and the lions. If it is your turn as a candidate, introduce one of the 50 included projects and try to convince the lions of your business idea. He also has a secret mission to perform that can earn him a bonus. Special events make every deal unique. As soon as the project has been presented, it is the lions' turn.&#10;&#10;As in the show, there is now a lot of discussion and haggling, because everyone wants to make the best deals. While the lions want to win as many shares as possible, the candidate is careful to the contrary. Once all the lions have submitted their offers or have spoken the magic words &quot;I'm out!&quot;, The candidate has to choose one of the offers or reject all. Now it becomes clear whether the project has been successful. so the shares he gets will decide the winning and the losing. If the candidate has given too many shares, he can also make losses! As soon as each player has the role of the candidate, the game ends and the player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",
