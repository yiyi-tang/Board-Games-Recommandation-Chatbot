There are lots of activities such as using your favorite gear, cooking meals, bonfires and kayaking. Of course there is not enough time to do everything.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most fun (points) as you can while camping. You only have so much time to camp so you need to make good use of your time. All the while weather can change, accidents can occur, and things can waste away your time.&#10;&#10;The game is played by dealing a 3 card hand. Activities require different amounts of time, food, and gear; all of which you must pay for from your hand. For more expensive activities, you can obtain more resources by discarding cards or carrying over cards to the next turn (where you are dealt 3 more cards). You do this until the cards run out, ending the round. 2 more rounds are played and a cumulative score is counted. Try to beat your high score!&#10;&#10;",

These objectives are hidden from the rest of the players.&#10;&#10;Design Together: One entryway is placed in the center and you take turns choosing from 3 floor plan cards to add on to the group floor plan. Your goal is to have as many of your main objective fixtures as possible.&#10;&#10;Design Apart: Each player creates their own personal floor plan by taking turns choosing a card, with main objective fixtures being worth 1 VP. The side objectives, windows, and variety of fixtures are used to round out the scoring.&#10;&#10;",

One day, a group of mad scientists discovered it, but they were not satisfied with just examining the beast in its dormant state, they wanted to wake it up and observe its activities.&#10;&#10;However, according to the literature, a large amount of activator is needed to wake up a Hexenbeast, and the waking Hexenbeast will immediately eat the person in front of it.&#10;&#10;The scientists are not on the best of terms. The fewer people who take their findings home with them, the better.

When the game end is triggered for the subtle Denmark map, a company's final stock value might drop depending on how many stations have been placed - the fewer stations, the steeper the drop! Tokening on the England &amp; Wales map will increase a city's payout. Getting big dividends is the name of the game - helped along by the passenger trains that score dits without counting them against your route, and hindered by the dangerous momentum of railway mania that might rust your trains (including 4Ts and 5Ts!) right out from under you. 3-5 Players (Denmark), 3-4 Players (England &amp; Wales).&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In SPYBAM, the different players (CEOs) compete with each other to gain control of the world. You can buy properties or campaigns on each continent and negotiate mergers between players, but ... beware of spies!! Their goals are dark, and they will try to screw you up.&#10;The setup begins by randomly delivering a business card and a different famous character card to each player with their own missions in order to win in SPYBAM. Even so, there are players who will have to go on a different side: the spies. They go together and win together. There will be a spy leader who knows the rest of the spies and the latter do not know the rest of their guild, so the spy leader must try to organize them without being discovered.&#10;At the beginning of each round, an extraordinary event card will be raised that benefits or affects depending on how you have your properties located on the different continents. Be prepared as these events can change your plans.&#10;Then each player's turn begins. Each one has 3 steps to perform:&#10;1) Steal an Advantage or Disadvantage card depending on the die.&#10;2) Draw a Property, Campaign or Fusion / Absorption card, choosing whether to activate it (paying its price) or save it in your deck of cards.&#10;3) Negotiate one of the following 5 options: activate a card from your deck, auction a card from your deck, forcibly buy an active property (from another player) paying double its price, move your headquarters or buy an advantage card to the bank.&#10;At the end of the turn of all the players, each one must invest in security the amount he considers, putting the money he considers in the security envelope. After this, all the players close their eyes and it is the spies' turn: one by one they will attack whoever they consider, leaving a token in front of the player. At the end of this dynamic, each player will look at the number of spy tokens received. If the number of millions invested is less than or equal to the spy tokens received, he will lose an active property. After this, each player receives the income from his properties and other cards before starting the next event or round.&#10;The objective of each player is to complete the missions assigned to their character as soon as possible. But if you are a spy, your goal is to fulfil the common spy missions, leaving aside those of your character. Spies win as a group.&#10;At any time during the game, a player can accuse another of being a spy, if he succeeds, he eliminates the spy from the game, but if he fails, he must compensate that player with a payment of money. Although if the accusation is carried out with an &quot;absorption&quot; card in its possession, if the accusation is correct, it takes all the spy's (Active) cards to its inventory (Not activated) in addition to eliminating it, and if it fails there is no penalty.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;En SPYBAM, los distintos jugadores (CEOs) compiten entre ellos por alzarse con el control del mundo. Podr&aacute;s comprar propiedades o campa&ntilde;as en cada continente y negociar fusiones entre jugadores, pero&hellip; &iexcl;&iexcl;cuidado con los esp&iacute;as!! Sus objetivos son oscuros y trataran de fastidiarte.&#10;El setup comienza entregando aleatoriamente una carta negocio y una carta personaje famoso distinto a cada jugador con unas misiones propias para poder ganar en SPYBAM. Aun as&iacute;, hay jugadores que les tocar&aacute; ir en un bando diferente: los esp&iacute;as. Ellos van juntos y ganan juntos. Habr&aacute; un esp&iacute;a l&iacute;der que conoce al resto de esp&iacute;as y estos &uacute;ltimos no conocen al resto de su gremio, por lo que el esp&iacute;a l&iacute;der debe tratar de organizarlos sin que le descubran. &#10;Al comienzo de cada ronda se levantar&aacute; una carta de evento extraordinario que beneficia o afecta seg&uacute;n tengas situadas tus propiedades por los diferentes continentes. Prep&aacute;rate puesto que estos eventos pueden modificar tus planes. &#10;Despu&eacute;s comienza el turno de cada jugador. Cada uno tiene 3 pasos a realizar:&#10;1) Robar una tarjeta Ventaja o Desventaja seg&uacute;n el dado. &#10;2) Robar una carta de Propiedad, Campa&ntilde;a o Fusi&oacute;n/Absorci&oacute;n, eligiendo si activarla (pagando su precio) o guardarla en tu mazo de cartas.&#10;3) Negociar una de las siguientes 5 opciones: activar una carta de tu mazo, subastar una carta de tu mazo, comprar forzosamente una propiedad activa (de otro jugador) pagando el doble de su precio, mover tu sede o comprar una ventaja a la banca.&#10;Al finalizar el turno de todos los jugadores, cada uno deber&aacute; invertir en seguridad la cantidad que estime, metiendo el dinero que considere en el sobre de seguridad. Tras esto todos los jugadores cierran los ojos y es el turno de los esp&iacute;as: uno a uno ir&aacute;n atacando a quien consideren dejando una ficha delante del jugador. Al final de esta din&aacute;mica cada jugador mirara el n&uacute;mero de fichas esp&iacute;as recibidas. Si el n&uacute;mero de millones invertidos es menor o igual a las fichas esp&iacute;as recibidas, perder&aacute; una propiedad activa. Tras esto, cada jugador recibe los ingresos de sus propiedades y otras cartas antes de comenzar el siguiente evento o ronda.&#10;El objetivo de cada jugador es cumplir las misiones que tiene asignado su personaje lo antes posible. Pero si te ha tocado ser esp&iacute;a, tu objetivo es cumplir las misiones de esp&iacute;as en com&uacute;n, dejando de lado las de tu personaje. Los esp&iacute;as ganan en grupo.&#10;En cualquier momento de la partida un jugador puede acusar a otro de ser esp&iacute;a, si acierta elimina al esp&iacute;a de la partida, pero si falla deber&aacute; indemnizar a ese jugador con un pago de dinero. Aunque si la acusaci&oacute;n la realiza teniendo en su poder una carta de &ldquo;absorci&oacute;n&rdquo; si acierta la acusaci&oacute;n, se lleva todas las cartas (Activas) del esp&iacute;a a su inventario (Sin activar) adem&aacute;s de eliminarle, y si falla no hay penalizaci&oacute;n.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer (Spanish)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A giant gorilla has been terrorizing the city of Rockport since Monday. All attempts to subdue the monster has failed. Named &quot;Coco&quot; by the locals, Coco will climb up the Rockport International to evade his attackers. As he climbs up the tower, military planes release a torrent of gunfire to attempt to stop Coco's rampage. Using a traditional deck of card, you will assume the role of Coco. Two columns of cards will create your tower. Starting from the bottom of the tower, you will manipulate cards to create an ascending order of cards all the way to the top of the tower. Using memory, planning and a little bit of luck, if you make it to the top of the tower, you win!&#10;&#10;But watch out! The higher up you go, the more likely that military planes will successfully hit you. If you are hit three times, before making it to the top of the tower, you lose!&#10;&#10;Once you are comfortable with the game, you can increase the difficulty with the Night Rampage variant. This requires a great deal of memorization. There is also an Extended variant with the addition of a two card spire on top of the building. This will challenge you with a thinner draw deck and a more intense plane attack.&#10;&#10;Can you safely guide Coco to the top of the tower?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Innomination, the customizable card game. Set in a world of Science Fantasy, select a Nation of various humans, lizardman, or giant insects, pick a leader, make a deck, and battle with another player. This is a one-versus-one game where you win by defeating your opponent. The language on cards does allow play with more than two players (but the game isn't competitively balanced around this).&#10;&#10;Innomination is a customizeable card game with deckbuilding elements. It similar play structure to games like Magic: The Gathering with elements from Yu-Gi-Oh!, Force of Will TCG, and the Pokemon TCG. Digital card games like Hearthstone and Shadowverse were also in mind. If you've played any of these, Innomination may feel familiar to you.  Innomination is not a trading card game (TCG). It is to be sold as a complete game right out of a box, like a board game. You'll get a full playset of every card. No rarities, no booster packs, no time spend scouring the secondary market for singles... Open the box knowing you have a complete card game.&#10;&#10;Every turn, you will set a Source card into play. Source cards produce Aether, the main resource used to play cards in your hand. The better the card is, the more Aether it costs. Unlike most games, the Source cards are in their own deck, and you get to choose which card you put into play every turn. There are six nations, each one with their own people, culture, and each specializing in an archetype, like aggro (win early with cheap, efficient cards), midrange (playing progressively stronger cards), and control (hold on until the late game and win with powerful, expensive cards).&#10;&#10;The Named Deck is the main mechanic of Innomination. Use the Named Deck to name (evolving) your nameless cards in the Main Deck into upgraded versions. You can only do this as a player action once per turn, but there are many Nations that have ways to do this multiple times.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Knowtable is a unique card game that is 100 percent about connection between its players.  Players get to share their stories and show off what they have noticed about the other players in the game.  Players learn about one another and learn what other people have noticed about them.  It is the rare kind of game where no one is sad when they &ldquo;lose&rdquo; because the process of the game is so fun and affirming.&#10;&#10;I developed Knowtable over many years with my daughters.  I am a single mother who values my connection with my daughters above all else.  We invented this game and we played it often because it always made us laugh and feel closer to one another.&#10;&#10;It is best for 3-8 players ages 10 and up, although it can be modified for younger players.  The premise is that a &ldquo;category card&rdquo; is pulled by a judge and the players have ten seconds to think of something that falls within that category that will *most appeal* to the judge.  At 10 seconds the judge counts down, &ldquo;3-2-1&rdquo; and the guessers shout out their guess. For example, the category is &ldquo;car.&rdquo;  The guessers might respond: &ldquo;a mercedes,&rdquo; &ldquo;the 1976 Rabbit that you got on your 16th birthday,&rdquo; &ldquo;a bike because cars are bad for the planet.&rdquo; Anything goes so long as it will appeal to the judge.&#10;&#10;This alone sponsors conversation.  Players like to explain their answer and the judge likes to explain why he or she picks the answer that most appeals to him or her.  The winning guesser gets the point and becomes the next judge.  In the case of a tie where more than one player asserts the same &ldquo;winning&rdquo; guess, &ldquo;break cards&rdquo; are pulled. The break cards contain descriptions such as &ldquo;biggest hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;youngest,&rdquo; &ldquo;shortest&rdquo;, &ldquo;most recently ate a piece of fruit,&rdquo; etc.  The player that best fits the description wins the tie break, gets a point and becomes the next judge.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You never say &quot;carrot&quot; or &quot;pepper&quot;, and when you flip a schnattergei, you must &quot;parrot&quot; the previous player by saying what they said, not what matches the color of the parrot. If you make a mistake, take two cards from your deck and place them under the discard pile.&#10;&#10;When someone reveals an item that matches the item on the top of the discard pile, everyone must race to slap the pile. Whoever does so first claims all the cards in the discard pile and puts them under their draw deck, face down. &#10;The game ends when a player runs out of cards and does not manage to win the discard pile in the same round. Whoever has the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Everyone was happily working on toys and getting ready for Christmas when all of a sudden Jack Frost and an army of minions showed up. They kidnapped Santa, scattered the elves, and are trying to ruin Christmas!&#10;&#10;Now, you&rsquo;ll have to work your way through the North Pole and rescue Santa before Christmas is canceled... all while Jack Frost&rsquo;s minions try to hunt you down...&#10;&#10;Overview:&#10;Take on the role of one of Santa&rsquo;s elves in order to sneak your way through the North Pole, defeat Jack Frost, rescue Santa, and save Christmas. But be wary, Jack's minions are searching for you to put a premature end to your holiday heroics. Collect weapons, recruit other elves, avoid capture, and find Santa before time runs out and Christmas is ruined!&#10;&#10;This game takes Gabe Barrett's &quot;HUNTED&quot; cooperative card-game system and adds a holiday flair. There was a VERY limited physical print run of the game made available as a 'secret bonus' only to backers of the &quot;Hunted: Wode Ridge&quot; Kickstarter campaign in early 2021. A print-and-play version is currently available to download.&#10;&#10;",
