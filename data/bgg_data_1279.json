B-Movie is an original bluff game, it&rsquo;s not you who are bluffing others, but them who are trying to trick you!&#10;&#10;There are 5 families of 8 actor cards with values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;ranging from -4 to + 5. The players have two actor cards in hand, but only see their backs. They don't know his family or his worth. On your turn, you must propose an actor from your hand to the other players, who can accept or refuse to engage him.&#10;&#10;If all players give the same answer (only YES or NO) he can give the card to any player. If both answers are present, he can only give the card to a player who answers yes. In all cases, he can keep the card to himself.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The CDG Solo System is a revised GMT Edition of Stuka Joe's CDG solo method, which streamlines two-handed solitaire gameplay by decreasing turn to turn overhead and maintenance. This method of play increases narrative immersion as the great battles of history unfold on your tabletop. The GMT edition of the CDG Solo System includes professionally printed components, a custom screen-printed die, an official ruleset, and Playsheets for six of GMT&rsquo;s most popular Card Driven Games.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview&#10;The CDG Solo System plays alongside your favorite CDG and is designed to enhance your solitaire experience by reintroducing many of the best parts of wargaming that fall apart in standard two-handed play, namely, as Stuka Joe mentioned above, the narrative flow and the fog of war.&#10;&#10;The CDG Solo System includes two Card Displays that are used to manage each side&rsquo;s hand of strategy cards. At the beginning of each Side's turn, you will roll a Fate Die to determine which of the cards in one or more of the slots are available for play. Typically 2 or 3 cards are available at a time, but the final decision is ultimately yours. After a card is played, the marker on the Cards Remaining track slides one spot to the left, and then it&rsquo;s time to roll the die for the other side&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players are each dealt a hand of cards and take turns playing Cities and attaching other cards to them as allowed, drawing additional cards at the end of each turn.  Players can potentially switch Cities' alliances through the influence of Leaders or seize them by force through military campaigns resolved through a combination of card and dice play.  The game ends once all cards are drawn.  The winner is determined based on total points scored in their tableau with different cards having different values.&#10;&#10;",

EL reloj de arena deber&aacute; ocupar tambi&eacute;n el centro de la mesa junto a las tarjetas durante toda la partida.&#10;&#10;C&Oacute;MO JUGAR: Comienza el juego el m&aacute;s joven del grupo. Su compa&ntilde;ero de la derecha tomar&aacute; la 1er tarjeta del mazo y le ense&ntilde;ar&aacute; la imagen del acertijo sin mostrarle la respuesta, e inmediatamente dar&aacute; vuelta el reloj. Si el jugador deduce el acertijo (concepto, frase o palabra) antes de que se cumpla el tiempo, se quedar&aacute; con la tarjeta y obtiene 1 punto. Si no responde correctamente, la tarjeta se devuelve al fondo del mazo, sin que se muestre la respuesta. La ronda contin&uacute;a en el sentido de las agujas del reloj de la misma forma con el resto de los jugadores.&#10;&#10;TARJETAS &quot;QU&Eacute; VES PARA TODOS&quot; (para todos los jugadores): Qu&eacute; ves incluye un conjunto de tarjetas que est&aacute;n marca-das con EL REY en color rojo. En caso que a un jugador le toque una de ellas, perder&aacute; la oportunidad de descifrar esa tarjeta en esa ronda y deber&aacute; mostrarla al resto de los participantes. Luego de dar vuelta el reloj, el primero en responder correctamente se lleva la tarjeta obteniendo 1 punto. &#10;En cambio, si ninguno de los participantes logra descifrar el acertijo, se lleva la tarjeta el jugador que la extrajo del mazo y suma 1 punto.&#10;&#10;&iquest;QUI&Eacute;N ES EL GANADOR? El primer jugador en descifrar 4 acertijos y obtener 4 puntos, es el ganador.&#10;&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME: Be the first player to decipher 4 riddles.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION: The deck (all 200 cards) is shuffled and placed in the center of the table with the riddles facing up. The hourglass must also occupy the center of the table, next to the cards, throughout the game.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY: The youngest player begins the game. The player to his/her right will take the top card from the deck and show him/her the picture-riddle, without showing him/her the answer, and will immediately turn the hourglass. If the player deciphers the riddle (concept, phrase or word) before the time is up, s/he will keep the card and get 1 point. If he does not answer correctly, the card is returned to the bottom of the deck, without the answer being shown. The round continues clockwise in the same way with the rest of the players.&#10;&#10;&quot;WHAT YOU SEE, FOR EVERYONE&quot; CARDS: The game includes a set of cards that are marked with the king in RED. If a player gets one of them, s/he will lose the opportunity to decipher that card in that round and must instead show it to the rest of the players. After turning the hourglass, the first player to answer correctly takes the card, obtaining 1 point. On the other hand, if none of the players manages to decipher the puzzle, the player who extracted the card from the deck takes it and gets 1 point for him/herself.&#10;&#10;WHO IS THE WINNER?: The first player to decipher 4 puzzles (get 4 points) is the winner.&#10;&#10;-from the game's official rulebook&#10;&#10;",

This involves running a gauntlet with enemy cannons to the left of you, to the right of you, and in front of you.&#10;&#10;Your task seems like folly... but yours is not to reason, yours is but to do and die.  &#10;The charge seems doomed from the start, but you do have the French Chasseurs d'Afrique on your left to possibly assist, and the Heavy Brigade behind you, so perhaps there is more chance to carry the opposition than at first appears?&#10;&#10;Play the game, experience the situation, and find out.&#10;&#10;The original orders: Lord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front, follow the enemy, and try and prevent the enemy carrying away the guns. Troop horse artillery may accompany. French cavalry is on your left. Immediate.  &#10;Optional rules and scenarios allow you to explore various &quot;what if?&quot; interpretations of these orders, providing more strategy.&#10;&#10;All you need to play the game (specifically designed for solo play) is:&#10;&#10;     a standard deck of 52 playing cards,&#10;     a six-sided die, and&#10;     pencil.&#10;&#10;&#10;Available separately or in Panzerschreck #18&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Inspired by the historic city of Hampi in southern India, Hampi is a tile-laying game in which players build the landscape of Hampi from tiles that depict farms, roads, temples, ponds, markets and tiny villages. Each new tile placed creates an ever-expanding board on which players gather the support of the local people who know the secrets of the land. Players score points by completing the landscape. The player who makes the most strategic placements of tiles and gains the required support of the locals suiting the condition of the mystery Jewel wins the game.&#10;&#10;The wise people of Hampi help in the searching for the Jewel. There are the miners, the priests, the elders, the merchants, the farmers, and the women. They express their support on the tile. Each tile scores support points differently, so, one needs to plan the placement of the tile carefully to gather the right support which determines the winner. You have a limited number of wooden markers that you use to complete your zone. Once placed, you don't get them back until the zone they're on is completed. You'll need to consider whether to go for small zones of quick support or work toward support points that really matter for you to win the Jewel.&#10;&#10;Early in the game, one seeker gets the Sun Jewel. But true to its nature, the Sun Jewel passes among the players and finally reaches its true seeker who has the right support of locals. So it is not about maximizing points but being mindful of whose support will lead you towards winning. Hampi provides plenty of ways to use your wit and outsmart fellow seekers.&#10;&#10;As the landscape grows, so does the opportunity for players to disrupt each other&rsquo;s plans. Everyone is adding to the same landscape and only seekers with the right support matching the condition of the Jewel will win. With its simple yet rich game mechanics and 96 tiles that can be configured into numerous combinations and possibilities.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "OBJETIVO DEL JUEGO: Ser el primero en deducir 4 acertijos de las tarjetas de rebus.&#10;&#10;PREPARACI&Oacute;N: Antes de comenzar, se mezclan todas las tarjetas y se colocan en la bandeja (con la imagen hacia arriba), en el medio de los jugadores.&#10;&#10;C&Oacute;MO JUGAR: Comienza el juego el m&aacute;s joven del grupo. Su compa&ntilde;ero de la derecha, tomar&aacute; una tarjeta del mazo y le ense&ntilde;ar&aacute; la imagen del acertijo, sin mostrarle la respuesta. Si el jugador descubre el acertijo (concepto, frase o palabra) antes de que se cumpla 1 minuto, se queda con la tarjeta, y suma un punto. Si no acierta, la tarjeta vuelve al fondo del mazo de cartas (sin mostrar la respuesta) y contin&uacute;a el juego de la misma manera, siguiendo la ronda en el sentido de las agujas del reloj.&#10;&#10;Tarjetas &quot;QUE VES para todos&quot; (para m&aacute;s de dos jugadores): Hay un conjunto de tarjetas &quot;Qu&eacute; Ves&quot; que est&aacute;n marcadas con el REY en color rojo. Si a un jugador le toca una de ellas, perder&aacute; la oportunidad de descifrar el acertijo en esa ronda, y deber&aacute;n hacerlo los restantes jugadores. Si alguno de ellos acierta, se queda con la tarjeta. Si no, se la queda el jugador que tom&oacute; la tarjeta del mazo.&#10;&#10;&iquest;QUI&Eacute;N ES EL GANADOR? El primer jugador en descifrar 4 acertijos, gana la partida.&#10;&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME: Be the first player to decipher 4 graphic riddles.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION: The deck (all 150 cards) is shuffled and placed on the tray (image side up), in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY: The youngest player begins the game. The player to his/her right will take a card from the deck and show him/her the picture-riddle, without showing him/her the answer. If the player deciphers the riddle (concept, phrase or word) before 1 minute expires, s/he keeps the card, and scores a point. If s/he fails to solve the riddle, the card returns to the bottom of the deck (without the answer being shown) and the game continues, in a clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;&quot;WHAT YOU SEE, FOR EVERYONE&quot; CARDS (for games with more than 2 players): The game includes a set of cards that are marked with the king in RED. If a player gets one of them, s/he will lose the opportunity to decipher that card in that round and must instead show it to the rest of the players. The first player to answer correctly takes the card, obtaining 1 point. If none of the players manages to decipher the puzzle, the player who took the card from the deck keeps it and gets 1 point for him/herself.&#10;&#10;WHO IS THE WINNER? The first player to decipher 4 riddles (get 4 points) wins the game.&#10;&#10;-from the game's official rulebook&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mackinaw is a perfect information two-player abstract game where players stack and trap tokens while they try to move their pieces to the other side of the board. It is a variable board size game, the most accessible sizes being a 3x6 grid (9 pieces per side) or a 4x8 grid (16 pieces per side). Its closely related to checkers/draughts and can be played with flat tokens.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to move your pieces to the the other player's starting position (one piece in each square on the other side of the board). Players take turns moving one piece one space at a time, either forwards, left, or right, but not backwards or diagonal. You cannot undo a move you did on your last turn. Your piece may move on top of other pieces. The pieces underneath are trapped and cannot move until freed when the piece above moves off. If you have an available move you must take it, you cannot pass your turn. If you cannot move, your opponent may keep moving until a move becomes available. Once a piece passes the mid-line and lands in the opposite side of the board with no pieces beneath it, it is 'home' and cannot be moved again. The first player to get all their pieces 'home' wins the game.&#10;&#10;Mackinaw was invented in 2019 by Tom Sutton, a Canadian animator and artist. It's name comes from the Ontario slang word for a checkered flannel coat; the first versions of the game were played with dark and light wooden blocks and often resembled the same pattern.&#10;&#10;",

Each card has 4 silly words on each side, so each player will have 16 words to play with.&#10;All players must combine one word on each of their cards to form a new slang phrase and arrange it face up in front of them. (They cannot combine two words on the same card).&#10;Once everyone is ready, each player must introduce their new slang phrase and tell the Mint Master what it means.&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;After each player has defined their word, the Mint Master awards 1 Mint to their favorite new slang phrase, plus:&#10;&#10;1 bonus Mint if that player used alliteration (two words with the same first letter, such as Boof Bucket) AND&#10;1 bonus Mint if that player used a rhyme (such as Poot Boot).&#10;The winner of the round may win anywhere from 1-3 mints based on their slang phrase.&#10;&#10;Round End&#10;&#10;Once the winner is chosen, all of the used cards are discarded, the Mint Master passes the tin clockwise, and you go back to the start.

(If the tin has less mints then the last winner is owed, that winner gets &lsquo;em all).&#10;Try to incorporate your new favorite slang phrases into your everyday life!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As a medium tank it has fairly middle-of-the-road stats, nothing that shines but nothing that is too bad either, but is versatile and with the addition of some cards can have its performance fine-tuned for the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Speaking of cards, the Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. H comes with a new selection of options, not duplicating the ones from the Starter Set. Included in the pack is Jack Of All Trades which makes your Commander incredibly flexible, granting an Initiative bonus to the tank during either movement or shooting phase. Swap this over each turn depending on the situation, to ensure that you can either outmaneuver the enemy or get your shots off first!&#10;&#10;Inside the Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf.

The basic tank has excellent Mobility and good Initiative straight out of the box, allowing it to easily position itself anywhere on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;This combination of stats makes the T-34 a natural hunter, able to pick out it&rsquo;s prey and hunt it down. Adding Designated Target to your gunner can enhance this ability by allowing the tank to ignore a targets cover bonus, assuming it has already moved or shot.&#10;&#10;Inside the T-34 Expansion Pack you will find a highly detailed, assembled, painted plastic T-34 miniature and tank card.

    "Description": "The Cromwell tank was one of a series of cruiser tanks fielded by the British in World War II. The concept of cruiser tanks was that they would combine speed with numbers, allowing the to swarm the enemy and overwhelm them. First deployed during the invasion of Normandy it found a natural home in the reconnaissance regiments where its excellent speed and low profile made it difficult to hit.&#10;&#10;The Cromwell Expansion Pack includes the same great model from the Starter Set but has a new range of cards that you can use to equip and personalize your tank on the battlefield. Straight out of the pack, the Cromwell as excellent Mobility and the best base Initiative of any tank currently in the game.&#10;&#10;Like the T-34 this combination of stats tends to make the Cromwell somewhat of an apex predator, able to hunt down other tanks with ease. Of course being awesome comes at a price, or in World of Tanks: Miniatures Game terms, a high Cost. This means you may not be able to afford many additional cards to equip your tank unless you plan ahead.&#10;&#10;If you do want to enhance the natural stats of the tank there are some great options in the pack, including Vertical Stabilizer which helps to make the tank more accurate when moving slowly, that will work well to enhance this already formidable tank.&#10;&#10;Inside the Cromwell Expansion Pack you will find a highly detailed, assembled, painted plastic Cromwell miniature and tank card. Your tank can be further personalized to match your requirements using the five crew, module and upgrade cards included.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Then the AI will maneuver each enemy plane (both Fokkers and Pfalzes) by a roll of a die.  Although random, the available movement options vary given the relative position of your Sopwith to the enemy.  As a result, the enemy AI is eerily accurate, meaning the enemy is quite effective at hunting you down.&#10;&#10;Then every plane shoots in a straight hex row if it has an enemy in its sites.  Your Sopwith has a range of 4 hexes, the Fokkers may shoot 3 hexes, and the Pfalzes shoot 2.&#10;&#10;Every plane is shot down on it's second hit.  Fokkers are worth 10 points, Pfalzes 5 points, and if your Sopwith is shot down, you are out.&#10;&#10;If you survive the first wave of 1 Fokker and 1 Pfalz, each successive wave adds 1 additional Fokker and 1 additional Pfalz.

In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.&#10;&#10;Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle's lane by the time that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.&#10;&#10;Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game. Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &quot;on offer&quot;. You may bid coins on only one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

For example, with the sun weather the acceleration is maximum +3 and the deceleration is maximum -2, with rain weather it is maximum +2 and the deceleration is maximum -2, but they must also pay attention to the entry and exit limits. always turns according to the weather.&#10;&#10;During the race the BotCar cars are always in play, even if you play with 2 players, so you will always have a minimum of 7 cars in the race and a maximum of 10 cars if you play with 5.&#10;&#10;The game is a simulation, luck is totally non-existent, the 10 moving gear cards that the player has in his hand are the same for all players, so only the player's strategic skill can lead to victory.&#10;&#10;The race ends when all the cars in the last round have crossed the finish line, the winner will be established according to the sum of the points scored by the 2 cars of the team calculated based on the finish position.&#10;&#10;&#10;Formula Board Game &egrave; un gioco da tavolo competitivo, strategico/gestionale per 2-5 giocatori, che permette di prendere parte ad una gara della massima competizione automobilistica, rivivendo tutte le emozioni di un Gran Premio.&#10;Il gioco simula tutti gli aspetti di una gara automobilistica, accelerazione e decelerazione della macchina, la strategia di gara, i pit stop, i sorpassi, il meteo variabile, la scelta degli pneumatici, incidenti e ovviamente i danni.&#10;Inoltre il giocatore attraverso dei token ha delle abilit&agrave; aggiuntive come frenata improvvisa, istinto e cambi marcia aggiuntivi, mentre attraverso delle carte azione che pu&ograve; giocare durante il turno, aggiunge attacchi come, sorpassi azzardati, la scia e la staccata ritardata.&#10;Il gioco comprende sia le auto principali dei giocatori, sia le BotCar (auto che si muovono autonomamente durante la gara attraverso delle carte apposite), ogni giocatore controlla durante la gara un team intero, quindi 2 auto, l'auto principale giocatore, che muove con le sue carte marcia e la BotCar corrispondente che si muove autonomamente, ma che il giocatore pu&ograve; aiutare con dei movimenti aggiuntivi attraverso le carte azione.&#10;Prima di iniziare la gara i giocatori dovranno effettuare le qualifiche per la propria auto principale, queste vengono effettuate attraverso un'applicazione per smartphone Android, questa &egrave; un'assoluta novit&agrave; nei giochi da tavolo a tema corse automobilistiche, perch&eacute; permette al giocatore di interagire attivamente, in quanto quest'ultimo deve dare prova delle sue abilit&agrave; di reazione per effettuare il miglior tempo di qualifica. &#10;Successivamente si procede all'acquisto del team composto dalle 2 auto attraverso un'asta. &#10;Successivamente i giocatori, dovranno effettuare sempre attraverso l'applicazione Android, una prova di abilit&agrave; per effettuare il primo movimento della partenza, anche questa assoluta novit&agrave;, che permette al giocatore di simulare in modo realistico l'emozione della partenza allo spegnimento del semaforo.&#10;Il gioco si svolge in vari round, ogni round &egrave; formato da 3 turni, dove i giocatori contemporaneamente devono posizionare davanti a se 3 carte marcia in maniera segreta, rispettando le regole movimento di accelerazione e decelerazione in base al meteo. Ad esempio con il meteo sole l'accelerazione &egrave; di massimo +3 e la decelerazione e di massimo -2, con meteo pioggia &egrave; di massimo +2 e la decelerazione di massimo -2, ma devono fare anche attenzione ai limiti di entrata e uscita curva sempre in base al meteo.&#10;Durante la gara le auto BotCar sono sempre in gioco, anche se si gioca in 2 giocatori, quindi in gara si avranno sempre un minimo di 7 auto e un massimo di 10 auto se si gioca in 5.&#10;Il gioco &egrave; una simulazione, la fortuna &egrave; totalmente inesistente, le 10 carte marcia movimento che il giocatore ha in mano sono uguali per tutti i giocatori, quindi solo la bravura strategica del giocatore pu&ograve; portare alla vittoria.&#10;La gara termina quando tutte le auto nell'ultimo round hanno attraversato il traguardo, il vincitore verr&agrave; stabilito secondo la somma dei punti effettuati dalle 2 auto del team calcolati in base alla posizione di arrivo.",

The original game was created by Ms. Lenhardt Kwaysser Fatime, winner of the 2020 Super Teacher Award, during her quarantine for her own class, and was later further developed with the help of the Blue Game. The year 2020 has left us with a lot of bad feelings and memories, but it is important that we can laugh despite the difficulties.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game, which can be played by 2-6 people, is to preserve our cold blood and overcome the obstacles in front of us in the constantly changing conditions. Collect all 19 points! During the game, they could step on a special game board that could change at any moment, creating a whole new situation for the players. When collecting points, don't forget about the mask and hand sanitizer! Funny quarantine cards will help or hinder us during our mission.&#10;&#10;If we come together from time to time to defeat the virus together, we can also play with the semi-cooperative game mode: here too we collect points for ourselves, but in the meantime we also have to pay close attention to the threatening virus so that it does not outgrow us! We can only defeat it by working together together if we are willing to make sacrifices and give up the points we have already earned. In the game, we tried to smuggle a lot of humor in addition to the current problems, to solve the limitations and annoyances of everyday life.&#10;&#10;Masks produced, have fun!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

The game is also suitable for children who like transport and means of transport.&#10;&#10;The cube-based vehicle game is easy even for the little ones: the winner is the first to collect the six vehicles.&#10;&#10;The second board is a classic party, where the winner will be the first to get from Vajdahunyad Castle to the Elizabeth Lookout Tower.&#10;&#10;In the third game, we have to go around the border of the capital, and the surrounding settlements and the building drawings on the map and the numbers and boundaries of the districts help to get to know our capital.&#10;&#10;The fourth answer table builds on the knowledge of Budapest.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for 3-10 year olds.

    "Description": "The Pratzen: Austerlitz, 1805 is a two-player Tactical level board-wargame that portrays the fighting on and around the Pratzen Heights at the Battle of Austerlitz. The battle was fought between the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte and a larger allied army composed of Austrian and Russian forces. The battle is considered to be one of the most important and decisive engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. The engagement result brought the War of the Third Coalition to an end and about the Treaty of Pressburg. The battle is widely thought of as a tactical masterpiece on par with Cannae.&#10;&#10;The game is designed by industry veteran and author of The Art of Wargaming, Peter P. Perla. The game system of The Pratzen: Austerlitz, 1805 began some three decades ago as an idea to update the classic SPI Tactical wargame Grenadier, published in 1971. Pratzen evolved into a merger of the Grenadier scale with some different combat mechanics based on the original von Reisswitz Kriegsspiel rules of 1824, adopted as a training tool in the Prussian army after the Napoleonic Wars. The scale was shifted from half-battalions to companies and divisions as the basic infantry maneuver piece, and much additional streamlining and simplification ensued.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;Carcassonne: 20th Anniversary Edition is a special edition of Carcassonne to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Spiel des Jahres win in 2001. This edition includes the tiles from the Carcassonne base game, &quot;The River&quot; mini-expansion (with five new river tiles), &quot;The Abbot&quot; mini-expansion, and a new 15-tile &quot;anniversary&quot; mini-expansion. All tiles are adorned with UV-print, with many detailed easter eggs being hidden in the art. Costume stickers are included in case you wish to &quot;dress&quot; your meeples.&#10;&#10;All contents are compatible with existing and future Carcassonne releases.&#10;&#10;",

They are then given $40,000 to start play.&#10;&#10;Through rolling a die and moving around the board, players can play various lottery games in an effort to accumulate the $1 million goal, or earn or lose money on event spaces (i.e. - Auto Accident, Pay College Tuition, Inheritance, etc.). On each of those spaces, the amount won or lost is determined by the number they roll after landing on the space. If a player cannot afford to pay a penalty, they can either pay what they have or pay nothing and miss their next turn, but no player is ever eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;In Triple Play, a player pays $400 to the bank and chooses one of the Triple Play number sets on their card and roll three dice up to three times trying to match those numbers. If successful, their winnings are based on how many turns it took out of the three to match the numbers. If they are unsuccessful, they win nothing and their turn is over.&#10;&#10;4-Play is the same as Triple Play, but with higher payouts, and the player rolls four dice up to four times. They also pay $500 to play it.&#10;&#10;Big Deal Lotto requires a $1,000 payment, and the player rolls one die. If the roll matches a number on their card, they cover it with a chip and and are on step closer to winning.&#10;&#10;Players may also join in on another player's lottery by being the first to shout &quot;Big Money&quot;, but risk paying that player if they are unsuccessful in the lottery being played. There is also an &quot;Investment&quot; space where players can put up between $1,000 and $10,000 in an effort to multiply their winnings.&#10;&#10;For a longer game, winning requires a player to both acquire at least $1 million, as well as match all six of their Big Deal Lotto numbers.&#10;&#10;",

Some tiles are face up and available for purchase at the start of play. Four action tiles lie face up as well. At the start of each of the eight rounds, one new action tile is revealed, then players alternate taking actions, with the number of actions increasing from two up to four over the course of the game. As players excavate their mountainous player board, new building and room tiles are added to the pool; some rooms can be used immediately when acquired, whereas others require the use of an action tile.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, players tally their points for buildings constructed and gold collected to see who wins.&#10;&#10;In Caverna: Cave vs Cave &#226;&#128;&#147; Era II, players start exploring a side cave abundant in ore. Donkeys help you move the ore to the surface so that you can cast iron and forge weapons out of it &mdash; to protect your cave from anyone who wishes it harm, of course. In the meantime, your tribe has grown four primates capable of work. Keep on collecting grains, fibers, and building resources to increase your wealth.

If the player answers it correctly, they keep the card. If they don't, it's discarded.&#10;&#10;When you win your sixth card and are one card away from winning, you must say &quot;Rabbit Rabbit&quot; out loud. If you forget and another player notices and says it first, skip your next turn, giving everyone else a chance to catch up.&#10;&#10;There are multiple ways to play:&#10;&#10;Team Play. If you're playing with four or more players, you can optionally split up into teams of equal size.&#10;&#10;Host Mode. Playing with three or more, and have an odd number of players? Designate one player as the Trivia Host, who opts out of answering cards, and instead has card reading duties.&#10;&#10;Scored Play. If you'd like a faster pace, the host can open up each question card to all players, and everyone who answers correctly each round gets a point. The first to reach seven points wins.&#10;&#10;Solo Play. Playing by yourself? Read the cards, challenge yourself to answer them correctly, and see if you're right.&#10;&#10;Important Note: Superstitions, like all folklore, can vary wildly and change over time, with multiple variations even in the same small region. If you find a superstition in Rabbit Rabbit described differently than one that you grew up with and hold close to your heart, you're strongly encouraged to share your version with everyone. That storytelling is part of the game!&#10;&#10;Rabbit Rabbit is the third game from Ami Baio of Pink Tiger Games, the creator of You Think You Know Me and Flatter Me: A Compliment Battle Card Game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Deploying a variety of Units and casting powerful Spells, players battle for control over the Turrets in each of the 4 lanes in order to destroy their opponent's walls.&#10;&#10;In the simultaneous Planning Phase, both players place a Unit card from their hand face-down in front of each of the 4 lanes (or a Bluff card to hide their intent) and Spell cards off to the side of the battlefield. Once both players are ready, they reveal their played cards, pay the combined energy cost, and attempt to predict their opponent's strategy before proceeding to the turn-based Action Phase.&#10;&#10;In the Action Phase, both players alternate resolving a single card at a time until all cards on the table have been resolved. Players can choose to resolve any Spell or Unit on the table in any order they wish. When resolving Units, players must resolve all of its Action Points in a single activation and then exhaust that Unit for the duration of the round. The main objective during this phase is to establish and maintain control over the battlefield and Turrets, while trying to keep Units alive long enough to reach the opponent's walls.&#10;&#10;After the Action Phase, any captured Turrets deal damage directly to the controller's opponent and the game proceeds to the next round following a quick Refresh Phase. Gameplay continues in this manner over several rounds until one player (or both) reach 0 health. If one of the players remains with at least 1 health, they are declared the winner - if not, the game ends with both players standing among the smoldering ashes of their outpost in a draw.&#10;&#10;",

Make deals to secure top-of-the-line upgrades for your crew, and score the most rep by the end of three cycles.&#10;&#10;Any time your marker is the one on the card closest to the deck, you will take the following actions:&#10;1: Add the card that is currently underneath your marker to position 1 of your assembly line. You may add it either action side or scoring side up.&#10;2. Choose a card in the new row by placing your marker on it.&#10;3. Activate your assembly line and update your upgrade trackers accordingly. Discard the card in position THREE of your assembly line and slide the 2 remaining cards down to open up position ONE once again. If the card was on its action side, then it is discarded, if it was on its scoring side then add it to your score pile.&#10;4. The player whose marker is now closest to the deck takes their turn.&#10;&#10;Once the final player has taken their actions, form a new row of cards and a new round can start with the player whose marker is placed on the card closest to the deck. When a Cycle deck runs out, move on to the next Cycle deck in sequence until all cards have been chosen.&#10;&#10;Once the Cycle 3 deck is empty and all cards have been chosen, continue activating your assembly line until all cards have left your assembly line. (i.e. the final card you chose will activate a full 3 times) Then move on to scoring.&#10;&#10;-description from artist&#10;&#10;",
