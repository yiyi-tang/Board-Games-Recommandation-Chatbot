As each player boasts about what card they've sent, other players may shout, &ldquo;Bah! Humbug!&rdquo; to catch them in a lie. Lies that go unchallenged are awarded &quot;coal&quot; at the end of the round, while lies that are successfully caught earn the accuser 1 &quot;holly berry&quot; (or take away holly berries, if the accuser is wrong.)&#10;&#10;A player can win Bah!

The mecha has a hollow body and the player loads a cylinder into the mecha and then fires it across the board by flicking the back of the mecha.&#10;&#10;The game board in You Be Aim is double-sided, so players can play two different games.

    "Description": "This game is based on Phat, a Scottish member of the All Fours family (whose members include Pitch, Pedro, and Don).&#10;&#10;Twenty-one tricks are played each hand; the object is to peg points on a Cribbage board for capturing valuable cards. The game end is triggered when someone pegs 180 (or more) points. The hand is completed and the player with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;The game is quite simple to teach as it uses standard must-follow trick-taking. To increase balance, one player will pick a trump suit and the other player will pick the rank order (which cards are high or low). What elevates the game is its distribution of card points among the ranks; in particular, trying to avoid giving up the high Phat points for capturing the middle-ranking 9s makes for some interesting and sometimes quite tense decisions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "June 27, 1898, Baler, Principe District, Luzon Island (Philippines). With the arrival of the Filipino insurgents from the Katipunan and in the midst of the Spanish-American War, a Spanish detachment made up of 53 soldiers and the local priest took refuge behind the walls of the town church, remaining completely isolated. Thus began one of the longest sieges in history that lasted 337 days, where the Spanish, despite suffering so many hardships, defended the last Spanish overseas position with great heroism. It would not be until June 2, 1899, when the act of capitulation was signed. Discover and enter a siege so unique to this exciting.&#10;&#10;Heroes of Baler &#10;On April 27, the US fleet of the Asiatic Squadron, commanded by Commodore Dewey, left Hong Kong for the Philippines. On May 1, he reached Manila Bay and defeated the Spanish fleet, commanded by Admiral Montojo, resulting in its entirety being sunk. The Cavite arsenal and plaza surrendered to the Americans the next day. The Battle of Cavite marked the beginning of the end of the Spanish presence in the Philippines. On May 19, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines on a US ship to lead the revolution, which spread throughout the island of Luzon. At the end of May, news reached Baler about the start of the war against the United States and the defeat of the Spanish fleet in Cavite. These were some of the last news received by land from abroad since the rebels prevented the passage of news through the mountains. The Spanish in Baler were completely cut off.&#10;&#10;The Filipinos tried at all costs to demonstrate to the Spanish detachment that the war had ended, but despite the numerous attempts at parliament that occurred during the months of siege, the Spanish refused to capitulate and surrender the plaza outright.&#10;After numerous attacks and attempts to take over the church by the Filipinos, it would not be until the morning of June 2 when Mart&iacute;n Cerezo began to reread the newspapers that Aguilar had left behind and those, he thought were Filipino forgeries in order to confuse them. for them to give up. In one of them, he found a small review that made him see that the newspapers were true, as well as his news: he realized that the war was over and that there was no point in continuing to fight. The review, within the section of military destinations, was the announcement of the new destination in Malaga of the lieutenant of the scale of the Infantry reserve Francisco D&iacute;az Navarro. Mart&iacute;n Cerezo had coincided with the officer, of whom he was a close friend, before he was assigned to Cuba. D&iacute;az had told him that at the end of the campaign he planned to request a transfer to the Andalusian capital, where his girlfriend and her family lived, so Mart&iacute;n Cerezo accepted the news as true and, by extension, all the newspapers and news that Aguilar had left for the that finally, that same day, the capitulation of the Spanish detachment took place.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;Heroes of Baler is a tactical game where players will take control of one of the two available sides (Spanish or Filipino). Both sides are asymmetrical so that the victory conditions and the way of playing are different for each side. Throughout the game the players (besieger and besieged) will try to achieve victory by carrying out firefights, raids, artillery attacks, repairs, trench construction...&#10;This is a game for 1 to 2 players with a game length within one and two hours. In the two-player game each player will take the role of besieger (Filipino) or besieged (Spanish). In the solitary mode, the player will take the control of the Spanish as besieged faction.&#10; Each game turn represents approximately two months of siege. The main panel represents the town of Baler with the church that the Spanish defended in the center and around it the Filipino bahays and trenches. In addition, the board shows two exclusive areas one for each player.&#10;Based on an game system which mix hand management and action points, the turn begins with the initiative phase where each side will try to seize the initiative in turn order. Next, in turn order the players will play their event phase where they may play up to two event cards and may play support cards to power up the played event(s) if they meet the requirements. Once this phase is finished, the events phase takes place where the Spanish player will have to deal with the lack of food that triggers the beriberi epidemic and the desertions while the Filipino side will have to deal with the supply of supplies and from the turn 4 with E.E.U.U. The player with the initiative will proceed to perform a mandatory firefight phase. After this phase comes the action phase. In turn order, players will play the rest of the cards in their hand as action points. The player second in turn order will proceed with the second phase of mandatory shootouts. Finally, a maintenance phase is carried out where the players will check victory conditions, take enemy fog of war cards and decide whether to give them to the enemy in exchange for a common card or keep them in their discard and prevent the enemy from obtaining that card. Finally, the military units are replaced in empty guard posts and detachment area, leader check rolls are made, and the next turn is prepared finally.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&bull; 1 game board&#10;&bull; 110 playing cards (55 in Spanish and 55 in English)&#10;&bull; 55 cards solitaire mode (27 in Spanish, 27 in English and 1 help card in both languagues)&#10;&bull; 6 help sheets (Two sets of 3 sheets in Spanish and another in English: 2 competitive mode help sheets and 1 solitaire help sheet)&#10;&bull; 3 cloth bags (Blue for Spanish player, red for Philippine player and black for solitaire mode).&#10;&bull; 190 counters (160 size 2x2cm. aprox. 0.8x0.8inches + 30 1.5x1.5cm. aprx. 0.6x0.6 inches)&#10;&bull; 2 rulebook (Spanish and English)&#10;&bull; 2 scenario book (Spanish and English)&#10;&bull; 10 six-sided dice (5 blue dice and 5 red dice)&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

When a player is ready to crack the case, they secretly look at the cards placed inside the Case File envelope to reveal who was the brains and who was the brawn behind the crime. The Clue Diced game is a compact and portable game making it a great game for travel and for on-the-go play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Put simply: Instead of moving pawns around the board and making a guess in a room (as in classic Clue), players simply roll 4 dice and pick a combination of people and roles to gain information about.&#10;&#10;Includes 2 levels of difficulty.&#10;Includes game case, 18 suspect cards, 4 dice, dice labels, case file envelope, suggestion board, detective pad, and game rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Syndicate Ultimatum is set in the cyberpunk world of the future. The world is under control of the World Syndicate, in whose hands all power is concentrated. But there are Corporation Cities that are not subject to him.&#10;&#10;In one of those cities - Helios - one of two players take on role of Stella - daughter of deceased head of the city, and other player become Roy - successor of Stella's father. Remember: Helios can only have one ruler! Who will become it? Players only have 24 hours to determine this...&#10;&#10;The struggle take place in five districts of the city. The goal of each player is to take control of more districts than his opponent. The game consists of two rounds, according to the results of which the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;Players in their turns place tokens from their player boards in an attempt to earn as many Victory Points (VP) as possible. Each type of tokens(there are five of them in the game) has its own abilities and its own strength. A district is considered to be under control of player if total power of his tokens in it is greater than that of the opponent. Each controlled district in the round end is worth one VP to player.&#10;&#10;But not everything is so simple. The game has 25 unique district cards that allow players to make changes on the struggle field. When player playing a card from his hand, he applies its ability and then places it on the Timer represent the hour counter.&#10;&#10;As soon as the twelfth card is placed on Timer, the round ends. The game ends after second round ends. Player with most VP is winner, in case of a tie both players are loosers, and Syndicate is enslave Helios.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetry module represented by four special Boss ability cards &mdash; the main tokens of players. Placing the Boss token on an district, the player applies its ability, which can frustrate all the opponent's plans.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played in tournament mode. In this case, players do not receive points for each controlled area. Instead, player receives one victory point if he wins the round. The game lasts up to two wins of one of the players.&#10;&#10;",

Players are trying to fill a narrow space with pentacubes against the clock.&#10;&#10;A pentacube is made from five cubes joined in various different patterns. There are two sets of matching cubes, one set for each player. At the beginning of the game, all the pentacubes are mixed up in a bag, and each player draws three. They take turns placing two of them on the board in any position, and keep the third as their hand.&#10;&#10;The board is a simple 6*7 grid and the pentacubes must not go outside of the grid. Nor can they go any higher than two cubes.&#10;&#10;The remaining cubes are tipped out in a pile, and players cannot touch them. One player starts and must pick a pentacube to place by sight alone in ten seconds, counted down by the opponent (who is allowed to count fast!). Once they have chosen their piece, they take it from the pile, and either place it or the hand pentacube, so that it fits on the board and goes no higher than 2 cubes.&#10;&#10;Players alternate this way until one player can no longer place legally, and they lose.&#10;&#10;The designer points out that players suffer in the back end of the game from poor choices made at the opening. Planning ahead is crucial to survival.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

As Emperor Penguins, players swim out to see in search of food for their young. But they risk being attacked by predators such as seals or orcos.&#10;&#10;Each player takes turns to take a food chip, worth 1-4, and then flip the Sea Card underneath the chip. Each card shows some aspect of life at sea, some are good fortune, some are bad luck.&#10;&#10;Players can choose when to give up feeding and return to shore, but they cannot go out again. The game ends when either all the penguins have gone back, or when a second orca appears, which means any penguin still at sea loses all their food.&#10;&#10;Of the penguins that got back home, the one with the most food value is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game cards includes information, so the game is good for educating children (who can read Japanese).&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Hydrangea Festival is the first game and was produced in memory of the designer's grandfather. It is sold with 3 postcards, so you can mail a copy of the game to somebody you miss.&#10;&#10;In the game, players are trying to have raindrops fall onto the petal of the Hydrangeas to change their colours. The raindrops are pink or blue (the player's colours), and the flowers are pink or blue or purple.&#10;&#10;The flowers change colour in sequence: pink, purple, blue. So a blue raindrop on a pink flower turns it purple, and another then turns it blue. A blue drop onto a blue flower locks the colour in place. The same works in reverse for pink drops.&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing flowers in the garden, and then raindrops in the clouds. As the drops fall, the flowers change colour until the clouds have passed. Players win by having more flowers in their colour at the end.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

By drafting cards, you accumulate resources (money, tools, training, and networks) in order to enter and occupy one of the empty houses on the game board. To do this, you need to spend the resources that the housing cards demand. Once inside, you have to resist for as long as possible police and law enforcement in order to try to win the game.&#10;&#10;But wait! You can't do it alone. If you want your project to survive thugs and speculators, you need the support of your teammates, either because they're good or because they have no choice. They will give you resources, they will help you to overcome the letters of order and law, and they will (sometimes) even give you their victory points. Resisting an eviction for as long as possible and helping your teammates earns you points, and that will be the key to victory.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;A les vostres mans estar&agrave; escollir un dels sis col&middot;lectius: Centre Social Okupat, Sindicat d'Habitatge, Casal Popular, PAH, Fam&iacute;lia del barri o fins i tot, la M&agrave;fia.&#10;&#10;A trav&eacute;s d'una selecci&oacute; de cartes en forma de draft.

DNA is first transcribed into mRNA in order to decode the genetic information. Then, mRNA is translated into proteins. The genetic information is often interrupted by &quot;junk&quot; fragments (introns) in higher organisms, such as humans. Therefore, the initial transcribed mRNA contains both genetic fragments (exons) and &quot;junk&quot; fragments. Introns should be removed and exons should be joined in a process called mRNA splicing. &#226;&#128;&#139;The splicing mechanism was awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Honour and Arms is a fantasy adventure game played on a map of a small unnamed region. Each player controls a character; there are 16 characters supplied, differentiated by their values in six different traits, their special abilities, and their alignments.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player rolls a die for their number of movement points and then moves from space to space on the map. In each new space a die is rolled to determine how many (if any) encounter cards need to be drawn. Encounters may be items which can be taken or may be beings which can be fought or bargained with, or in some cases taken on as minions. Fighting provide experience, either physical or psychic, and when a character has three experience of a type they must turn them in for increases in traits.&#10;&#10;There are a number of fixed locations on the board with special rules in a separate adventure booklet, and in some cases special decks of encounter cards. There are also minor locations which have cards in the standard decks and are placed on the board once found.&#10;&#10;There are rules for encumbrance, player vs. player combat, healing, etc. Players may band together as a group. Some activities are regulated by alignment, of which there are two kinds: good vs. evil and imperial vs. rebel. For example, good characters can't attack without provocation.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to win the game, all dependent on alignment. For example, a good character can achieve a spiritual victory by entering the Nether Realm and defeating the Prince of Darkness, while a rebel character can achieve a political victory by finding the king in his keep and defeating him. Some ways require finding the five rings forming the Hand of Fate, but if a character wears all of them at once they may become bewitched by them, in which case they get special powers but then can only win by killing all the other characters. The rules suggest that for a shorter game a time limit is set and then if no one has achieved a victory condition, a scoring rubric is provided.&#10;&#10;",

Winning showcase cards gives you points, but at a cost: it if a player leads with a card matching a suit of a card in your showcase, you must follow suit for that trick. Moreover, cards from your showcase may only be used to follow, and your opponent sees your cards. For the second ten tricks, once the talon is gone, you play out your hand and showcase. Preparing  your evolving hand to win more points overall is a cerebral conundrum.&#10;&#10;Some unique features include that in the first half it's easier to lose tricks than to win them (since phase-1 is played &quot;all trump&quot;: any card of an off suit wins). Simultaneously, the showcase allows the leader to determine if their opponent must follow suit or not-- so for connoisseurs of trick games there are new interesting puzzles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Manage your team of familiar employees and win by completing projects OR by getting everyone else FIRED by HR instead!&#10;&#10;The game starts with all Employee Cards being dealt to each Manager. Each Manager is then dealt 5 cards which be their hand. During a turn, a Manager can choose to play a Misconduct Card OR a Project Management Card OR an Action Card from their hand. At the end of a turn, Managers redraw to make sure they have 5 cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;There are two ways of Winning HR.&#10;&#10;The first is to eliminate all other Manager's Employees by serving them Warning Letters for Misconducts. When an Employee receives 3 Warning Letters, the Employee is Fired and placed in the Retrenched Pile. Some Misconduct Cards would deal 2 Warning Letters to specific types of Employees instead of 1.&#10;&#10;The second way of winning the game is when a Manager successfully completes an entire Project Cycle by putting down all 4 stages of Project Management Cards.&#10;&#10;",

The publisher says &quot;A music competition for primary school children, with no psychological warfare. Let's get into the rock swamp!&#10;&#10;The game is a tournament between 8 high school girls chosen from the 12 signs of the Zodiac. You might think that this is a beauty contest or a story about a prince who wants to become a princess, but it's not. It's a battle of rock guitar riffs.&#10;&#10;The game is short and minimalistic, so all but the finals are decided in a &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; kind of way, with lots of draws. Until the final, you may not reveal which girl you are favouring.&#10;&#10;In the final, you will have to play the Do-Re-Mi... on the card as if it were a guitar riff battle. &#239;&#188;&#136;The final is a guitar riff competition. (The author has arranged the music, but there is no stave, so you will have to make corrections and add any missing notes.)&#10;&#10;The game is very light and quick to play. Recommended for primary schools children.

    "Description": "Spin Fighters were die-cast metal top toys that were manufactured by Bandai in China in the mid 1990s (1993-1997).&#10;&#10;The Spin Fighters tops were loaded into Launchers (Later, called &quot;Power Launchers&quot;), which were then tightly wound by fingertip, and subsequently released into the Spin Fighters Battle Arena (or, onto a flat surface). The tops battled (hitting against each other) until the last top spinning was the winner.&#10;&#10;Spin Fighters tops were ~1 inch across, came in black and gold colors, and bore a prismatic sticker featuring a character from a TV show or video game. Usually, the black tops represented the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; and the gold tops represented the &quot;Good Guys.&quot; Spin Fighters were sold two to a package: one gold and one black spin fighter. Power Launchers and Battle Arenas were available separately or bundled. Spin Fighters tops can be disassembled and worn on jackets, shirts, and hats, through any small button hole.&#10;&#10;Production of Spin Fighter ceased around 1997. They are widely seen to be the forerunner to Beyblade, which began production in 1997.&#10;&#10;Spin Fighters series included: World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Saban's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and Capcom's Street Fighter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Doppeldoppel is a trick-taking game for 3 to 4 players about carrying souls down to a lower world.  However, if two souls descend at the same time, they will disappear!&#10;&#10;The game uses an irregular deck of cards, with 1-3 cards in each of ranks 1-6 in each of 3 suits.  Depending upon the player count, some cards are played face down, and others face up, but it is a &quot;must-follow&quot; game, and the highest ranked card of the lead suit will win.  However, in keeping with the theme, if two or more cards of the same rank are played, they are removed from consideration.&#10;&#10;The winner of the trick collects any remaining cards into a score pile.  All cards start at -1 points, but each rank has a unique scoring or play affect.  For instance, if you have at least three cards of rank 1, each of your rank 1 cards is worth +2 points instead of -1; each rank 5 card is worth +7 points if you have no rank 6 cards.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the number of players; at the end, the person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Histories of the Empire, Volume 1: The Stormcloak Rebellion is a narrative driven expansion to The Elder Scroll: Call to Arms. Enabling its players to take part in pivotal events such as the search for the Jagged Crown and the Battle for Whiterun, culminating with the final push on the capitals of Solitude or Windhelm.&#10;&#10;It includes a three-part campaign detailing the rise or fall of the Stormcloak Rebellion in their fight against the Imperial Legion. The first act details the skirmishes and rising tensions that lead to the Battle for Whiterun. The second places the player in command of their chosen faction, allowing them to tactically decide which holds to attack and gradually push their front lines toward the enemy&rsquo;s capital. The third and final act entirely focuses on the siege of a faction&rsquo;s capital, moving from the walls into the city itself and culminating in the hero&rsquo;s facing each other for a final confrontation that will decide the fate of Skyrim.&#10;&#10;Included within this book are new rules for setting your battles within any of the nine Holds of Skyrim. From Haafingar with its soaring peaks to The Rift and its many beast nests. These new Hold rules allow players to further expand on the environment mechanics presented in the core rules and experience more thematic battlefields.&#10;&#10;Building and expanding on the existing rules for Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms, this book offers new and exciting experiences for fighting in Tamriel. Adding extra effects to environments, altering what equipment each faction can take and offering thematic bonuses based on the holds the player controls, these expanded rules add a new depth to the game so the player can truly control how their faction handles the war.&#10;&#10;Also included are rules for an entirely new faction - Hold Guards. Included are Heroes, Followers and Adversary cards that can be used as allies or enemies in your struggle for dominance.&#10;&#10;",

The game is &quot;must-follow&quot;, but the lowest number played of the lead suit will typically win the trick, and the highest number played, regardless of suit, will lead to the next trick.&#10;&#10;The winner takes their die and sets it in a special scoring cup; dice from the cup will be rolled at the end of the round to determine each player's rank, with higher rolls being awarded with more points.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after a number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

The basic actions involve sailing their ship, creating a route, or checking for treasure.  The additional action allows a player to move their ship along the route they have created.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns until a player has discovered both of their opponent's treasures; the discovering player wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;In a little village in Fairy Tale Land, there lived a friendly old doctor, who all his life wanted nothing more than to help people. Whenever a call came in, he grabbed his bag and rushed to the patient's bedside. Very often, however, he found that in his haste, he had brought the wrong cure. But did that stop him? No, he tried anyway, and, funny as it may seem, his patients would always get well.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players each choose a color of playing piece, and place them on Doctor Quack's house in the center of the playing board, to start. Each player draws one Cure Card. Players spin to see who goes first.&#10;&#10;In order to reach the different cases, players take turns spinning and moving their playing piece along a path of their choice. When they land on a case space, they can check to see if they have the matching Cure Card for that case. If they don't, they can either keep moving on subsequent turns to try to find and reach the matching case, or they can make their way back to Dr. Quack's house to pick up another cure. The other way to get an additional Cure Card is to spin a 6, 9, or 10 - then you can choose to take a card instead of moving that turn.&#10;&#10;Once a player makes a cure match, they collect that case card, which indicates a number of points on it. When all cases have been cured, the player with the most total points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Board spaces are rooms in the house -- the bedroom is the office, the living room is the movie theater, and the kitchen is the school.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is similar to the standard Monopoly board game but with humorous differences. Tokens can't share a space because of social distancing, and players will want to watch out for the screaming child because they'll have to pay to entertain the kid.&#10;&#10;This version of the Monopoly game makes the most of life at home with social distancing and missed activities like visiting a movie theater, yoga studio, and more.&#10;&#10;     HILARIOUS TOKENS: Racecar with parking boot, Rubber duck with babies, T-Rex with boxer shorts, smaller dog, penguin with coffee cup, Cat with bath cap., &#10;     UPDATED UTILITIES AND HOME-THEMED BOARD SPACES: In this family board game, WiFi and video streaming are necessary utilities, and board spaces are places in the home, such as the kitchen turned school.&#10;     AVOID THE SCREAMING CHILD: When a player moves their token, they also move the screaming child; if the tokens land on the same space, the player must pay to entertain the screaming child.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Community Chest&quot; becomes the &quot;Community Cupboard&quot;. Chance is still called Chance, but is now illustrated with boxes shipped from online orders.&#10;&#10;The money tweaks the classic design to look like a house, and each denomination features different food items inside the 'house'.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Charming family is an eclectic family that lives in a manor on top of the hill in the town of Banebridge somewhere in New England circa 1932.  They own the local mortuary as well as a mining company.  All they want to do is live in peace, take care of their ancestral home, run their businesses, and get along with the townsfolk.  The villagers of Banebridge, however, see it differently.  Many of them are firm of the opinion that at least some if not all of the &ldquo;Charming&rdquo; family are up to nefarious deeds and are, in fact, &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; of various sorts. To that end, they are constantly turning up evidence that implicates members of the family in foul play. Some villagers even start stalking individual members. Sometimes (well, a lot of the time really), the family members are forced to take action to deal with especially difficult villagers or incriminating evidence. Actions include Murder, Terrify, Beguile, Deceive, Extort, Bribe, Coerce, and many more. Of course, the family would NEVER take such actions if the villagers weren&rsquo;t constantly interfering.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gathering Gloom is a cooperative game for 1-4 monsters in which the players take on the role of a Witch, a Mad Scientist, a Vampire, a Werewolf, a Zombie, or a Ghost and work to resolve a series of crises at their mansion and businesses. Each character has one or more special abilities and some have vulnerabilities.  They use their own attributes as well as those of villagers they have beguiled into minions along with resources on their &ldquo;Misdeed&rdquo; cards to resolve 14-16 crises in order to win the game. Gloom gathers every turn based on events as well as from Evidence or Peril cards.  If the gloom reaches 50 or more before resolving all the crises, the players lose. Also, if the fear that the villagers have about anyone player reaches twelve or more, the family is exposed and the players lose.&#10;   &#10;The village has seven locations to visit along with three family locations on the board. There are many things to do on the map since each location has a unique action the player can take.  There are also alternate buildings that can be selected at setup to add variety to play.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll dice to determine events. Then you can move to any location on the board, where you may activate an on-arrival action; you may use cards to perform other actions; you may resolve crises in family locations. Finally, you check to see if any villagers or stalkers are going to activate. You draw up for your next turn, and you are done.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The game title is a vulgar expression, as the theme of the game is about human&rsquo;s filthy life. The publisher's blurb says &quot;Throughout life, people accumulate their filth to reach their climax, then fall suddenly.&quot;. So the game title translates as 'Life told through the anus'. The box cover shows a purse with a star-like decoration, which is recognisable in Japan as an anus.&#10;&#10;The publisher says &quot;In this game, the cards are played out two at a time from a hand of five. At the end of each round, the hand is replenished from the deck, so you always have five cards in your hand. This makes trick-taking a relatively light game.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards in the game: simple numbers 1 to 5 and special cards with the number 0. The special cards are Monko-sama (a monk) and Servant. The person who makes a bigger number with two cards wins the trick (an offering at the temple), but the special cards affect the trick.&#10;&#10;If there is a servant played, the player who played the servant wins.&#10;If there is both a servant and a monk played, the player who played the monk wins.&#10;If there is no servant but a monk is played, the player who played the monk loses.&#10;In a battle between monks and servants, the player with the higher number wins.&#10;&#10;As you play, the number you play in a round is your 'life experience' and you record this value of the experiences you have talked about.
