    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;With the Allied forces heralding formidable units into the fray, Axis players will want to expand their armies to include a walker with multiple cannons for a broad range attack or a laser cannon to target Allied squads. The forces in the Dust Tactics: Light Panzer Walker expansion can be customized to either Heinrich or Hermann, both offering advantages for any Axis general to bring onto the battlefield.&#10;&#10;With one of the most deadly weapon systems seen since the beginning of the war, the Panzer AufkclarerLaufer 1-A, aka &quot;Heinrich&quot; can crush an entire squad, whether or not it&rsquo;s equipped with heavy armor. Heinrich&rsquo;s incredible firepower derives from its four powerful FlaKvierling cannons. The Panzer AufkclarerLaufer 1-A is also versatile enough to use against lightly armored targets or engage enemies from a great distance, due to it being a light and agile vehicle.&#10;&#10;The Axis&rsquo; newest light footed anti-tank robot, Hermann, elicits the same uneasiness in your opponent as Heinrich. With a revolutionary laser cannon Hermann can easily destroy targets much heavier than itself. Entering into a long engagement? Partner Hermann with your other Axis units, like a Recon Grenadiers squad, to both protect it and utilize it for a lengthy battle. If you&rsquo;re looking to annihilate your opponent early in the game, find Hermann a secure position and use its sustained fire to waste any Allied armored unit.&#10;&#10;",

Some are champions, battling against the ever-encroaching influence of Chaos, while others become agents of darkness, reveling in the favor of Ruinous Powers. But for good or ill, the winds of fate grant these influential figures the means to alter the Old World for generations to come, and in doing so, to become legends.&#10;&#10;The Legends Expansion is the latest deluxe expansion for Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game, and it brings the power and influence the Old World's greatest figures to your deck. With 165 cards (3 copies each of 55 cards) consisting of new options for players of all factions, the Legends Expansion delivers compelling new mechanics and deck-building options that will bring your Warhammer: Invasion game to new levels of immersion and strategy.&#10;&#10;Chief among the gameplay innovations introduced by the Legends Expansion is the inclusion of a new card type: Legend.

For new and casual players, Legend cards present an exciting additional layer of strategy. For veteran players, these powerful cards are the keystones around which entire decks can be built.&#10;&#10;Placed in the center of your capital board, Legend cards lend their power to all three of your zones, along with certain other benefits as described by their text. Your kingdom will prosper under the strong guidance of Thorgrim Grudgebearer, Karl Franz, Malekith, and many more.

Players can change its path (using new movement card called: light signals). In most of the game rounds Liberator drops something and randomly picked up tokens appear in location on the map. First player who manage to pick it up will receive some small bonus in form of victory points, additional movement, special actions etc. The drop tokens are kept secret and players can use them in any moment of a game which makes interesting combo-opportunities.&#10;&#10;The second expansion is about delivering private mail. There are private letters in different locations from the start of the game. Contrary to the orders each letter may be picked up only by one player and each player can have as much of private mail as he/she wants. Moreover the letters should be delivered before the game ends not only in next few game rounds. The tricky part is that each undelivered letter results in minus points to the player who picked it up.&#10;&#10;The last part of Liberator expansion are the new secret mission cards!&#10;&#10;Two expansions may be added separately or both at the same time to both versions of the base game: basic and extended.&#10;&#10;",

Battle of Gods, is a variation on the good old game of War, which tries to add some subtleties, both with tactics and bluffing.&#10;The first new idea is that cards are played in pairs. First, each player plays a card. Cards are revealed, and then each player plays a second one, and their values are added. This makes for some interesting dilemmas.&#10;The second new idea is that there are 6 sets of 12 cards, for six different mythologies. In each game, each player plays a different mythology. In each set, two or three cards have special effects when played, making for interesting combos and even more bluffing.&#10;It's a two player game, but the six available mythologies make for 15 different possible duels.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battles by Gaslight is based on the popular Gaslight Victorian science fiction rules, but is designed to allow players to fight larger battles with several players each controlling four or more units.  Game mechanics have been streamlined to allow players to control more units; however, the flavor of Gaslight has been retained.  48 pages.&#10;&#10;Units in Gaslight generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters, in Battles by Gaslight this is expanded so that a player will control three or four entire units each led by a (Main Character) Commander which are in turn led by an overall Army Commander. A player may also control vehicles and their crews. The games are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.&#10;&#10;Command and control is accomplished now through a combination die roll and card-draw turn system. Movement is based on moving entire units as they activate, keeping them within distance of their Commander. Firing is done by units as a whole now instead of individual figures like in Gaslight (although Main Character Commanders may fire separately) and the firing procedure is still very streamlined. Morale is handled in a similar fashion to Gaslight with minor adjustments.&#10;&#10;The authors made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules.  Instead the rules allow for the use of any vehicles, weapons, and creatures that players desire for their personal perception of Victorian science fiction.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The cooperative game Ghost Stories often has players on the edge of their seats with uncertainty over whether their monks will be able to protect a village against the many aspects of Wu-Feng that threaten it. With Ghost Stories: Black Secret, the players will face an even more powerful dilemma: Wu-Feng himself.&#10;&#10;Yes, the player count for Black Secret is 2-5 (instead of 1-4) as one player will take on the role of Wu-Feng and harass the monks in a more direct manner than they've experienced previously. Wu-Feng now chooses where the incoming ghosts will be placed on the individual monk boards. Instead of placing the ghost on the board, Wu-Feng can use that ghost to power colored spells matching the color of the ghost (while casting the spells bring Wu-Feng access to stronger spells) or to bring new demon miniatures in play that scour the catacombs underneath the village; these figures are searching for the remains of Wu-Feng by digging in the dirt located there, and should they find the three icons required, the shadow of Wu-Feng descends on the village to fight directly with the monks.&#10;&#10;To aid the monks in their fight against this more devious incarnation of Wu-Feng, they have access to blood mantras, special abilities that come in different levels to adjust for the difficulty of play. When a monk loses a life, the Qi token is placed on the mantra. When two tokens are on one of the level-2-mantras, one monk of the players' choice gains a Qi. When 4 Qi are collected on one of the level-4-mantras, all village tiles are dehaunted.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Tactical Assault: Fantasy Cards&trade; is an elegant card-driven rule set for bringing exciting clashes of sword &amp; sorcery - including command &amp; control and the fog of war - to the tabletop battlefield in a very playable fashion. The rules are even able to incorporate the some of the more obscure aspects of pre-gunpowder warfare such as war machines, artillery, obstacles, sappers and so forth into the same fast-play, narrative based system.&#10;&#10;Despite being deceptively simple in appearance, the Fantasy Cards provide a very challenging game full of hard choices and long range planning. The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.&#10;&#10;In addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.&#10;&#10;And if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Fantasy Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles&trade; print-n-play packs. These sets give Fantasy Card players everything they need to play exciting battles in a hex and counter style format - including unique scenarios, beautiful full color maps and more than enough counters to allow players to develop their own scenarios. The only thing the players need to provide is their own Fantasy Card decks!&#10;&#10;All of this is offered in an easy to download print-n-play format available at the Tactical Assault Games website - along with articles on tactics, tips &amp; tricks, designer's notes and more!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Wizard of Oz : The Game (Kids version) is an entry-level game with the objective of collecting three token cards while travelling down the path of the Yellow Brick Road and arriving first at the Emerald City. The game is played on a colorful board with beautifully reproduced scenes from the movie. This is a roll-the-die-and-move game with different spaces on the Yellow Brick Road where you collect your tokens and perhaps encounter the Wicked Witch (who causes you to lose your turn) or Winged Monkeys (who you must battle using competitive die rolls - win and you gain a Token card, lose and you miss your next turn). There are also spaces for drawing Toto cards which provide players with special abilities.  Landing on an Emerald City space allows you to draw an Emerald City card and a corresponding Token card. Corner spaces are considered &quot;enchanted&quot;. The Glinda corner space lets you move ahead 6 spaces. The Ruby Slipper space allows you to double your movement that turn. The final corner space is the Wizard of Oz and allows you take a Token card.  For kids 6 years and older.&#10;&#10;From the Rules:&#10;&#10;Relive the most beloved motion picture of all time as you follow the Yellow Brick Road through the Land of Oz to reach the Emerald City. As Dorothy, Cowardly Lion, Tin Man or Scarecrow, you will defeat the Wicked Witch of the West, battle winged monkeys and collect your corresponding tokens. Help Dorothy keep her Ruby Slippers, Tin Man find a Heart, Scarecrow a Diploma and Cowardly Lion his Medal of Courage. Then, continue on to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard of Oz.&#10;&#10;This is a different game from The Wizard of Oz: The Game.  Notably, that game is a family game, whereas this is children's game.&#10;&#10;",

The queen monkey has thus given birth to a baby monkey.&#10;&#10;A monkey baby, like a monkey queen, captures exactly like a Chess queen.&#10;&#10;Babies also have a non-capture move. During non-capturing moves, babies must move closer to the enemy queen.&#10;&#10;You win if you capture the enemy queen, or deprive your opponent of moves.&#10;&#10;.&#10;&#10;",

You are a captain of industry, seeking to expand your burgeoning railroad empire.  Your tools are the railroad cars produced by you and your fellow magnates.  Draw cards and place them wisely to earn big points.  Vie for control of public railroads and stock to earn extra bonuses.&#10;&#10;In Iron Horses, players compete to build the most lucrative railroad trains using a special deck of cards.  Each player starts with one train, consisting of a locomotive engine and a tender full of coal.  Players will add cars to these trains.  The cars themselves are produced by four manufacturing companies, each owned by a player.  Some types of cars (a passenger coach, a cattle card) are more valuable than others (like simple boxcars).  And adding cars to your train in the proper color order earns bonus points.  Don't forget about the public lines, though, which earn points for the players who have contributed most to their construction.  Finally, in multiplayer games you may purchase stock in other players&rsquo; train lines, thus capitalizing on their successes.&#10;&#10;This game was developed for the Quick Print and Play Design Challenge:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/625604/quick-print-and-play-design-challenge-entry-thre&#10;&#10;The work-in-progress thread may be found here:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6398031&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While called Chessyball, the game really has little to do with chess, it is more a soccer game. The game plays on an 11 x 18 board, and each team has 10 players and one goaltender.&#10;&#10;Pieces move as Queens in chess, i.e., moving as far as they want in a straight line, or until reaching the outer edge, or another piece. When stopping by the ball, the ball shoots in the direction away from the moved piece, until it hits another player, or wall. The idea is to maneuver the ball for a goal, a three square wide area on a player's home side. Player one gets one initial move, player two gets two and then each player had 3 moves a turn. There are some additional advanced moves.&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to find and sink one of the Japanese Air Carriers. The Japanese army wins if players lose a certain number of planes or if the USS Yorktown is sunk.&#10;&#10;Each turn you have to choose between different actions, move between sea zones, attack enemy planes, or search for the Japanese carrier. All dice rolls are based on poker hands--the better hand you roll, the more efficient the action is. You can reroll as many times as you want as long as you have enough fuel and time. Time is a precious commodity in the game.  You have to beat a certain number of event cards each day before the clockwatch runs out.&#10;&#10;You will get trophies when you destroy enemy planes, which help your piloting skills improve. You will prepare for the final Dive Bomb, a risky attack maneuver, for which you only have one bomb. Fail and you will have to come back to the carrier reload.  Hit the deck, and the explosion can crack the carrier with just one hit.&#10;&#10;",

The call has gone out for a Hero to rise up and undertake a series of Quests, each designed to bring ruin to the Dark Lord&rsquo;s dark plans. Do you have what it takes to solve the Quests before Darkness consumes Dragon&rsquo;s Ridge and its inhabitants?&#10;&#10;MyQuest is a solo game designed to allow you to explore a fantasy town and its surrounding wilds in an attempt to thwart the plans of the enemy - a Dark Lord and its deadly Minions. Players choose from one of six different Heroes and must undertake 3 Quests, chosen at random from a deck of 30 Quest cards. Before the game begins, one of 10 different Dark Lord cards will be selected (at random) for the player to rise up against, each with a unique power and the command over one of four different Minion types: infernal demons, unrelenting undead, savage beasts, or elemental primordials. In this way, the game will offer variety each time it is played, as the Quests, Heroes and enemies can be different.&#10;&#10;Heroes must overcome terrible Misfortune cards that get in their way and will even have to face Encounter cards that provide various skill checks that they will have to master. The central mechanic for the game revolves around rolling six-sided dice and trying to get at least one 5-6 to pass the myriad of tests facing each Hero. From the spoils of their victories in battle and chance encounters, Heroes will also earn gold that can be used in town to heal wounds, remove curses, buy items of power, and sail to distant spots on the board.&#10;&#10;But time is not on the player's side, for the Threat of Evil track grows as Minions reach the town square or certain cards are drawn from the Misfortune deck. Does your Hero have what it takes to battle back against the likes of Evil such as the Demon Prince, Insane Horror, Ancient Dragon, Troll King, or Lich (to name a few)? Only the brave, cunning and quick will be victorious.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Central idea and goal of the game&#10;&#10;Players are adventurers trying to find the temple of the God of Snakes in the jungle. Unfortunately, this is a rather dangerous endeavour as the jungle is full of poisonous snakes. The expedition that is first to reach the temple wins the game. Be careful not to run out of snake antivenom though...&#10;&#10;Game-play (short summary)&#10;&#10;Each player moves their token on a board. Normal movement is one space, but moving 2, 3 or 4 spaces is possible via a push-your-luck element (pulling an item out of a bag, which, depending on what you draw, allows you to move more spaces or costs you some of your antivenom). A player who has no antivenom left is eliminated from the game. Event cards add another luck element.&#10;&#10;Game-play (detailed description)&#10;&#10;Each player gets a player token (wooden jeep) and 6 bottles of antivenom (cardboard chits). The jeeps are placed on the starting area of the board. Players try to get their jeep to the temple by moving it on the board. The board has four types of spaces: normal spaces, swamp spaces, river spaces and event spaces.&#10;&#10;Normally, players move their jeep one space per turn. On each space, there can only be one jeep, and players must move their jeep. Instead of moving one space, players can choose to call upon the God of Snakes - either because they want to get on more quickly or because moving one space would take them on a space they can't stop on (because it is already occupied by another player's jeep or because it is a swamp space on which players are not allowed to stop).&#10;&#10;To call upon the God of Snakes, a player has to reach into the &quot;magic bag&quot;. The bag contains 4 wooden snakes, two green ones, a blue one and a red one.&#10;If a player draws the dangerous red mamba, they are not allowed to move on and immediately use up one of their antivenom bottles. The red snake is then put back into the bag. &#10;If a player draws a blue or green snake, it means that the God of Snakes has answered their prayers. The snake is put on the next free altar space in the center of the board. The number on the altar space tells the player how many spaces they move (2, 3 or 4 spaces). When the last blue or green snake has been drawn, all snakes are returned to the bag.&#10;&#10;Drawing the blue snake announces dangerous water snakes. If any player is on a river space when the blue snake is drawn (or if they would land on a river space after moving), they lose a bottle of antivenom.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on an event space, they have to draw an event card. Event cards are either positive or negative: losing/gaining a bottle of antivenom, choosing a player to lose a turn, having to draw a snake from the bag, getting another turn, losing a turn, moving forwards/backwards one or more spaces.&#10;&#10;If a player has lost all their antivenom, it becomes too dangerous to continue the expedition and they are eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with ten pieces called Pods arranged on opposite sides of the board. &#10; A Pod moves by orbiting a neighboring piece of either color, called the pivot. A Pod can orbit around a pivot through any number of empty spaces or through outer space (off the board) provided it comes to rest on an empty space on the board. It must land in a space adjacent to the pivot in the forward direction. A Pod cannot capture. &#10; When a Pod reaches the shaded area on the far side of the board, it promotes to a War Pod. A War Pod moves like a regular Pod, with the exception that it can land on any orbital space (i.e., forward progress is not required), and it captures any enemy piece that it orbits around. &#10; When a War Pod returns to the shaded area on its own side of the board, it promotes to a Death Pod. A Death Pod moves like a War Pod, with the added condition that it captures any enemy piece that it lands next to.&#10; Because pieces must have pivots to move, an isolated piece is frozen. The game is won by scattering the enemy fleet and leaving it with no move. A player who has no pieces or no moves at the start of a turn loses.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Art&eacute;, the players represent important tycoons of the 19th century, who love medieval art and architechture.&#10;&#10;To follow their passion, they find in Alfredo d&rsquo;Andrade the perfect collaborator to restore old buildings or edify new ones, respecting the style of former centuries.&#10;&#10;During the game, you will challenge your friends in a hard competition to find money, materials and workers to realize the artworks you desire, by asking new projects to d&rsquo;Andrade, and cooperating with architechts, artists or builders.&#10;&#10;Use at best the available actions to realize the best artworks and gain more victory points than your opponents.&#10;&#10;The Play of the Game&#10;&#10;Art&eacute; is played over a series of rounds. During each round, every player will take turns assigning his or her Tycoon (and possibly Foreman) to a circle on the Activity Board. Rounds continue in this way until a player completes his or her last Project and there are no more Project Tiles left in the stack.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Second Round, on your turn you must move your Tycoon Pawn to a different empty circle on the left side of the Activity Board. You cannot leave your Tycoon on the same&#10;circle, or on another circle in the same row!&#10;&#10;If you have activated your Foreman, you must place it on an empty circle on the right side of the Activity Board - or move it to a different circle if it is already on the board - on your turn.&#10;&#10;You may use your Tycoon and your Foreman in any order you choose each turn.&#10;When you place your Tycoon Pawn or Foreman Pawn on a circle, you immediately follow the instructions on the space to the right of your chosen circle.&#10;&#10;After you complete any Tycoon or Foreman actions on your turn, you may spend Resources to complete any Projects you are working on. Once all players have had a turn, the round&#10;ends and a new round can begin.&#10;&#10;The End of the game&#10;&#10;If you have no incomplete (face up) Project Tiles in front of you at any point during your turn, and there are no more Project Tiles left in the stack for you to draw, the game will come to an end. Finish playing your turn as normal.&#10;&#10;This is your final turn for the game. Each of the other players then takes one final turn. After all players have completed their final turns, the game is over and it&rsquo;s time to add up your score!&#10;&#10;",

It is designed to be quick and fun.&#10;&#10;In Dream Shift, the player must battle his or her nightmares in a constantly shifting dream world.  Each dream setting or nightmare is a manifestation of the dreamer's subconscious attempting to communicate with the conscious mind in order to resolve various issues.  Maybe the dreamer needs to learn something about him- or herself.  Perhaps he or she has some fear or guilt that must be overcome.  The Dream deck contains both Setting and Nightmare cards.  The player begins with one Setting and one Nightmare, and must resolve issues presented by these cards in order to draw a new Dream card to replace either the Setting or the Nightmare.&#10;&#10;To do this, the player has access to Power cards.  These allow the player to resolve issues on the Setting and Nightmare cards, which will shift either the Setting or the Nightmare and present new issues to resolve.  The player must make careful use of his or her Power cards to strategically draw additional Power cards or to shift the dream.  The game ends when the Dream deck is empty, or when the player is &quot;stuck&quot; with no Power cards to resolve the issues presented.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes an air game system, a ground system and unique rules where command and control are critical for movement purposes. Use of SAM missiles and SAGGER AT play important roles to keep the Israeli at bay. At first, it appears as a &quot;David vs Goliath&quot; battle because of the disparity of forces. The Egyptian needs to create breaches and bridging and move quickly before the balance favors the Israeli. Time is not a friend to either side at various times in the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battaglia di Lepanto 1571 is a Tactical level wargame for 2 players that simulates the Battle of Lepanto between Christian and Ottoman fleets.&#10;The game includes a hex map depicting the sea and part of the coast, on which the players will setup their fleets of war galleys. Each war galley is represented by a hexagonal counter with all important data on it, and with two sides (normal and damaged).&#10;&#10;Taking turns, the players will give orders (move, board, fire or ram - this last one only available to Ottoman galleys) to their fleet and move their ships in order to win the battle. Orders are issued using Order cards, while the combat is resolved with 6-sided dice. Boardings are resolved by playing Tactical cards, attempting to outmaneuvre the opponent. When a player cannot play a Tactical card that &quot;parries&quot; his opponent card the boarding is resolved with a roll of dice.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 7 turns under the basic rules, and ends when a flagship is captured or destroyed.

It also includes several pages on modifying the scenario pack to reflect a similar situation in many of the different eras within the BattleTech canon universe, making it more flexible from the outset than many.&#10;&#10;",

Instead that's only one of the ways for the round to end.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the start of each round each player is dealt six cards and places them in two rows of three cards without looking at the cards. On a player's first turn, he first flips two cards face-up &ndash; one on the top row, the other on the bottom &ndash; then takes his turn, drawing the top card of either the discard pile or the deck. The player then either:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Replaces one of the cards in his array with the newly drawn card, placing the new card face-up and placing the replaced card on the discard pile.&#10;     Discards the card he drew.&#10;     Places the card on a matching face-up card in his array, then discards both of these cards, then the card either above or below this position.&#10;&#10;&#10;The goal of Flip Six is to have the lowest total when the round ends, and the round ends when a player has six face-up cards, a player has no cards (due to discarding) or a player calls for the end of the round because she thinks she has the lowest score; in all cases, each other player takes one final turn.&#10;&#10;Players then tally their scores, which can be negative due to the deck including negative numbers. If the player who ended the round doesn't have the lowest score, that player's score for the round is doubled. The player with the lowest score after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a non-active player starts the timer, then the active player races to create a word using at least one of the letters facing him on his rack and at least one letter facing out from an opponent. Words must be at least four letters long, and a player cannot use letters from more than one opponent.&#10;&#10;If a player calls out a word before time expires (and the word is valid), then the player scores the letter cards used in the word, leaving those particular letters face up. If a player uses all six letters in his rack or an opponent's rack, then he takes another turn (after players refill their racks to six cards). If a player fails to call out a word, the first non-active player to grab the &quot;flash round&quot; token from the center of the table creates a word and scores it.&#10;&#10;When the card deck runs out and no one can create any more words, the game ends. Players sum the letters they used in words (with wild cards being worth zero points), then subtract the point value for letters that remain in their racks. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Furthermore, the first-tier game has a very small chance of being a total bust which causes anyone owning it to lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

The players must work together to stop the Villain before his/her Master Plot succeeds, or before the Terror level becomes unacceptably high.&#10;&#10;Hand, deck, and risk management are key aspects of game play. The heroes each have a unique starting deck of 15 Special or Super Power cards, the latter of which come in three levels of increasing potency. These cards are used by the players to act during the game - mainly to neutralize Threat cards by matching the symbols found on them with the symbols on their Power cards. Throughout the game, the players can upgrade their Super Powers (and unlock new ones) through the use of Valour Points accumulated by facing threats and neutralizing plots.&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Midnight Men est un jeu coop&eacute;ratif de super-h&eacute;ros hautement th&eacute;matique aucours duquel les joueurs utilisent leurs &quot;decks&quot; personnels de cartes Pouvoirs pour neutraliser les menaces et complots initi&eacute;s partout dans la ville par le Vilain.

Les h&eacute;ros ont chacun un paquet unique de 15 cartes de Pouvoirs Sp&eacute;ciaux ou Super Pouvoirs. Ces derniers viennent en trois niveaux de puissance croissante. Ces cartes sont utilis&eacute;es par les joueurs et permettent principalement de neutraliser les cartes Menace en jumelant les symboles qui s'y trouvent avec les symboles sur leurs cartes. Pendant la partie, les joueurs peuvent am&eacute;liorer leurs Super Pouvoirs (et &eacute;ventuellement en d&eacute;couvrir de nouveaux) en utilisant les points de Valeur qu'ils auront accumul&eacute;s en faisant face &agrave; des menaces ou en neutralisant des complots.&#10;&#10;",

They dedicate their lives to trying to build the most magnificent Island in order to impress the mysterious and alluring &lsquo;Angels&rsquo; who are believed to offer eternal life, rebirth and all one could desire.&#10;&#10;Life on the islands is hard, mining asteroids for ore to refine in hot furnaces to increase the power and prestige of their Islands. The presence of weapons is known to anger the Angels, but some Islands develop them regardless, seeking to increase mining production, for defence, or for attacking their rivals.&#10;&#10;When the Angels arrive, their whims are capricious. Sometimes they merely observe, sometimes they attack. Only the most magnificent Island in the eyes of the Angels will be chosen to be visited by them.&#10;&#10;INTRODUCTION&#10;A game for one to three players who must navigate through space, looking for asteroids to mine in order to obtain the ore needed to build and improve their Island. They must avoid deadly asteroid collisions and the aggression of their rivals as they await the coming of the Angels, bringing with them the promise of eternal peace and the threat of destruction. The winner has the greatest island (decided by points) at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;Each player controls an 'island' a fully self-sufficent space station.  Players must move through the asteroid dense area of space on the board, destroy asteroids and then collectthe shattered remnants.  This can then be refined to create pure ore, and the different ores can be used to create different additional sections of the island, or repair damaged ones.&#10;&#10;Needless to say, eventually the islands will come into conflict with each other.&#10;&#10;The game's length is determined by the appearences of the mysterious angel-ships, players do no know how long the game is going to last exactly (20-45 minutes on average) and so must judge wen to build offensive weaponry (which score negative at the end), and when to capitalise on point scoring with certain sections (such as more luxurious living quarters and armour) nearer the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The angels appear throughout the game, often dealing death and destruction to the island sections.  The final angel's appearence ends the game, points are scored, and one player wins, becoming the chosen recpient of the angel's love.&#10;&#10;",
