Adding fuel to the fire, a Dragon has taken up residence near by!&#10;&#10;The Dragon has agreed not to burn down your villages if you sacrifice Virgins to it (bit of a stereo-type, that). For the good of your villages you've got to keep your Virgins uh, virgins.&#10;&#10;So send any Strapping Youths, the Bad Boy, and that smooth singing Musician off to another player's village! Don't forget to keep the Sheriff in a friendly village to keep the peace and if you can, make sure the Bartender only gets the Blacksmith drunk!&#10;&#10;If there are no virgins to sacrifice at the end of a round the dragon does what dragons do best. Burning down your villages and gobbling everyone up even you Lords!&#10;&#10;",

Additionally and most importantly it shows that it is always better to be a Team Player.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each kid is represented by a Blaze The Cat firefighter token. The board represents a 10 story building with 8 rooms or stairways on each floor. The players race to the roof and then jump into the rescue helicopter. The first player to reach the top is the winner but all of the children board the chopper at the end of the game... nobody dies.&#10;&#10;The cards are intended to teach lessons about courtesy, safety, and the things firefighters do in an emergency. Players roll dice and draw cards to move during a turn. Some reading will be required unless a parent or older child reads the cards.&#10;&#10;Includes 4 tokens, 70 cards, a die, a colorful board, and the rules.&#10;&#10;",

Though designed as a &quot;hex-n-counter&quot; board game, Quantum Legions can easily be adapted as a miniatures wargame. Details on how this can be accomplished are provided in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;Finally, like most Majestic Twelve products, Quantum Legions includes rules for creating your own units so you can add to its exciting background, simulate your favorite movies and television shows, or create your very own universe!&#10;&#10;Quantum Legions: Wargaming on an Epic Scale.&#10;&#10;Additional Details:&#10;Units are represented by counters with basic information (movement, range, attack dice, etc.) Players roll 2d6 for the number of command points available at the beginning of the turn. Command points are used to remove suppression markers, activate ordered units and place orders on units to activate on future turns. Combat is bucket of dice with the target number depending on the attack order and number of dice modified by the target's terrain.&#10;&#10;The PDF includes five 11&quot;x17&quot; map sections. Two map sections are used in the basic scenario. Also included are 1&quot; unit counters and 5/8&quot; order and suppression markers.&#10;&#10;",

These events are actually thought to discourage players from continually drawing arsenal cards, and to randomize things around.&#10;&#10;",

With three new options to add to your game, Exodus is a great way to expand on the accusations and mistrust that runs rampant in Battlestar Galactica.&#10;&#10;You can choose to add any combination of the three new options included in Exodus. Crave more white-knuckle space dog-fighting? Incorporate the Cylon Fleet option. The Conflicted Loyalties option introduces new Loyalty Cards that will test even the most trustworthy allegiances. Finally, relive the emotional turmoil of the hit television series with the Ionian Nebula, which pits players against the various conflicting personalities aboard Galactica.&#10;&#10;The Cylon Fleet option keeps the pressure intense by introducing the Cylon Fleet game board. This board makes sure that every Crisis Card drawn will result in some sort of enemy ship activity. Once the Cylon Pursuit Track reaches the end, the Cylon ships will transfer over to the main game board, surrounding Galactica. There&rsquo;s little time for rest between assaults, so get out there and protect those civvies, fighter jockeys!&#10;&#10;Alliances are put to the test in the Conflicted Loyalties option, where the new Final Five Loyalty Cards up the stakes and introduce penalties for revealing your fellow humans&rsquo; Loyalty Card. In addition, new Personal Goal Loyalty Cards present players with an incriminating task to undertake. If they don&rsquo;t fulfill their goal, then they will cause Galactica to lose a resource at the end of the game. Will you raise suspicion by completing the damaging task, or will you lay low and hope your failures won&rsquo;t condemn the rest of your crew?&#10;&#10;Finally, with the Ionian Nebula option, familiar faces populate the fleet as allies, and can be encountered by visiting locations on Galactica. But beware! The Cylons can influence these non-player characters, compelling them to produce negative effects when encountered. Manage humanity&rsquo;s conflicting personalities carefully... or infighting will leave you vulnerable!&#10;&#10;",

Then they both reveal their cards.  If they both played the same cards, nothing happens, if their is no card corresponding then the opponent gets full damage.  When one card corresponds he gets 'half' damage.  He puts this on his damage board (left side head, right side head, left side torso, right side torso, left leg, right leg), On each is a score track when the score track reaches the maximum the fight is lost.

Fremen units which stay in the space will also be destroyed. Can't be played if a worm appears.&#10;Juice of Sapho: After a player has committed their cards to a battle, look at the entirety of their remaining hand before making your own choice.&#10;Imperial Conditioning: For one battle only, before players have committed cards to a battle, your leader cannot turn traitor.&#10;Break Imperial Conditioning: Cancel Imperial Conditioning when it is played in your battle.&#10;Weirding Way: Before any part of a battle occurs, play to double the casualties that battle inflicts on your opponent.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Suggested UseFive cards without effects are included in the base game, and two more 'useless' cards are added in Dune: Spice Harvest and Dune: The Duel. This variant suggests replacing those seven cards with the first seven of the variant cards, and to, once someone has blown the Shield Wall, replace the Family Atomics card with Weirding Way and/or have that card function as Weirding Way.&#10;&#10;An alternate method suggested is to buy an additional full set of Treachery cards and overwrite the normal effects with the variant card effects (pasting the new image onto the card, or for a more modern audience, using sleeves and inserts).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Interaction with other ExpansionsThe 'Reviving the Ghola'/Bene Tleilax expansion adds additional uses for the 'useless' Treachery cards. If the variant cards replace useless cards and that variant is also in use, they should be marked to indicate that they also count as 'useless' cards for the Tleilaxu's purposes. The alternate method is probably preferable if these are used together.&#10;&#10;",

The opposing player takes the role of Alexander, bishop of Alexandria, and attempts to convince the world that Jesus was equal to God.  Players must move quickly around the board, spreading their message across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players draw two cards, each of which has a certain number of action points.  Using one card for action points, players move around the board and lay down support cubes.  The other card is stored away, to be used at the Council of Nicaea. &#10;Players debate at the Council of Nicaea with the cards that they've put away in order to gain further support for their position.  &#10;Once all cards are discarded, the player with the most support wins, and the opposing player is labeled a heretic.&#10;The Arian Controversy: A Game of Heresy and Hilarity brings all of the tension and name-calling of early Christian controversy to the comfort of your living room!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the box: Tembisa is a unique combination between card and dice game that allows you to play three different games which are all based on Africa and its adventures.&#10;&#10;The three different games are:&#10;1. Tembisa, the treasure hunt&#10;2. Tembisa, the African farms&#10;3. Tembisa Memory&#10;&#10;The game materials consist of 1 die, 4 wooden pawns and 56 playing cards. Besides a startcard and finishcard (showing the treasure in a cave), the cards show different situations you come across (e.g. a hungry lion, a wild river, a giant snake, friendly villagepeople). Each card also shows a negative number, STOP, or 1 or 2 dice to roll.&#10;&#10;1. Tembisa, the treasure hunt&#10;A line is laid out of the playing cards. All cards, except for the start and endcard are placed facedown. A player rolls the die and moves his or her pawn accordingly. If the card where the pawn ends is not face upwards yet, do it now. In either case: this card shows a picture of what you met, together with a it's effect on your pawn: move it accordingly. (The number of places shown backwards, STOP or roll 1 or 2 extra dice.) The card where pawn ends up has no further effect for that players turn.&#10;When six uncovered cards are in a uninterrupted row, this region is deemed fully explored. Only the positive cards keep their effect.&#10;The player to reach the endcard showing the treasure first, wins the game.&#10;&#10;2. Tembisa, the African farms&#10;For this variant, the start and end card are not used.&#10;Players try to build the biggest farms. A farm is build by placing a -1 card on the table. This farm can be enlarged by placing a -2, -3, ... on top in order.&#10;A player is allowed more than one farm, all starting with a -1.&#10;The STOP and 1 and 2 dice cards are used for protecting and stealing cards from the other players: to attack play a stop card on anothers farm, depending on further STOP or dice cards, a dice duel commits between attacker and defender. If the attacker wins he or she robs a die roll of cards from the top of the attacked farm. These must be used immediatly to enlarge his or her owns farm(s) or be discarded.&#10;A STOP card can also be used to protect one farm. When placed on top a farm of your own, that farm is protected against robbings. However, you cannot enlarge it anymore either.&#10;Players hold six cards in their hands, drawing 1 extra at the start of ones turn. This can be a card from the drawpile, or the top one of the (open) discard pile.&#10;At the end of ones turn cards are discarded or taken to fill up to 6 cards.&#10;STOP and dice cards are removed from play once used. &#10;Gameplay continues till there are no more cards in the discard and drawpiles. (The discardpile is reshuffled and becomes the new drawpile each time.) Then the values of the farms are added for each player, the player with the largest farm is the winner! (Just count as if each card had a positive number, instead of a negative.) Cards held in hands don't count.&#10;&#10;3. Tembisa Memory&#10;A variant on ye old Memory. The goal is to make pairs of cards. The STOP cards count as jokers, it can form a set with any other card. However, two STOP cards are not a set!&#10;The 1 die and 2 dice cards are also jokers, but also give a number of bonus points at the end of the game: roll one or two dice accordingly for the number of bonus points.&#10;Scoring: The values of the couples are counted, dice bonusses are added. Player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

If the next player can fill this empty space, they must do so. If one or more blocks tumble off the plate on your turn, set them aside next to you.&#10;&#10;The game ends one of two ways: Either a player knocks off three or more blocks at once, or everyone has placed all of their blocks. In either case, score points to see who wins. To do so, view the tower from above and count the number of blocks in your color that are visible, then subtract 1 point for each dropped block in your possession. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

After ten rounds, the player with the fewest critiques wins.&#10;&#10;If you can't make a long word, you can instead try to make one that ends in a string of cards of the same suit (a &quot;meld&quot;).  Because the game combines word-forming skills with other pattern formation, a player's obscure vocabulary will help but not guarantee a win against players with more conventional vocabularies (but an eye for long melds).&#10;&#10;",

The monks are normally forbidden to drink their own beer, except on their &lsquo;night of madness&rsquo; - Verr&uuml;cktheitsnacht, where one special barrel is marked by the Abbot for consumption by the monks.&#10;&#10;On this night all of the monks attempt to gain the barrel of beer from each other. They all claim not to want the beer for themselves, but merely to save their brothers from it. Once a monk reaches his cell, he may lock himself in and safely dispose of the beer. Whatever happens during the night of madness will never be spoken of ever again.&#10;&#10;Players roll two dice to move themselves (one when carrying the barrel or being watched by the Abbot), plus an additional die to move the Abbot. The winner is the first monk who can carry the barrel into his cell after it has exited the cellar, brewery, kitchen and refectory. Monks can attempt to chastise and berate each other to help themselves gain the upper hand, or the Abbot can berate another monk on their behalf.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website: &quot;JUGGLER is a word game for 2 to 6 players, played on a table with a special deck of 70 alphabetic cards (one letter per card, with a score value - E is worth 1, J is worth 8 ...etc). The Juggler card deck actually consists of two decks, one of 22 vowel cards with red backs and faces, the other of 48 black consonant cards.&#10;&#10;Object/Overview&#10;&#10;&quot;A game comprises several &lsquo;rounds&rsquo;. At the start of each round, each player is dealt just seven of the black consonant cards; the remaining cards are placed face down on the table as two decks (one red, one black). Players play in turns around the table in a clockwise direction. The aim is to build the best word you can in your hand by drawing and discarding cards. If you turn your whole hand into a word, you can then &lsquo;declare&rsquo;, which means you stop the round, hoping to catch the other players with valuable cards they can&rsquo;t use.&#10;&#10;&quot;After a player has declared, everybody else has just one more turn in which to make the best of their hand. When play comes back round to the declarer, all the players place their hand of cards onto the table, announcing their word for that round and scoring the total face value of all the cards they have used for their word (MINUS the total face value of any remaining unused in their hand). The scores for each round are recorded on paper and when any player&rsquo;s running total hits 70 or more, the highest total wins. &quot;&#10;&#10;",

Fast paced, competitive, and with no sissy turn taking, this is a game of frantic action and fun! &#10; Each player controls a set of 5 Rugby players, drawn from 2 of the teams competing in the 2011 Tournament. How you manipulate, position, and toss these players will determine the ultimate victor.&#10;&#10;--- How To Play ---&#10; Each player takes a team of five Rugby player figures in their hand, then yells:&#10;&#10;Touch!

The differences with Othello are that you don't just place tiles on the board, you also move them around. Furthermore, placement and movement is determined by the colour of the squares of the board. There are squares in the colors of each of the players (white and blue), as well as 5 neutral squares. Given that there are less squares for the blue player (8 versus white's 12), the blue player always gets to play the first move.&#10;&#10;",

The meeting attendees arrived as planned at Santa's home. They enjoyed appetizers and engaged in fun Christmas trivia questions while waiting for the meeting to begin. They had fun with an exciting game of 'What Christmas Thing am I' followed by a challenging game of Christmas Taboo. Mrs. Claus served a delicious dinner along with an entertaining Christmas Scramble challenge. The meeting was productive and the Christmas spirit was soaring high until to everyone's shock...a murder occurred! The Christmas characters all rallied together to figure out whodunit before this scandalous murder ruined Christmas! After everyone accused who they believed the murderer was...everyone came clean with their involvement in the crime and...the murderer confessed! While the group awaited the North Pole P.D. to arrive and arrest the accused, the group played a fun game of Christmas Charades.

You can play any number of matching cards from your hand to move your reindeer, but you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to use action spaces on the paths or even other reindeer to your advantage. Once all of the tiles have been taken from one of the paths, the player who has collected the highest total number of points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Ever since that one foggy Christmas Eve, the guy with the red nose has gotten all of the attention, but if you play your cards right, perhaps this is the year we'll be singing about Stuart, the Silver-Nosed Reindeer!&#10;&#10;",

There is no limit to the number of players.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;Each player starts with 6 cards in front of them face-down, representing 6 presents under 6 branches of their Christmas tree.  Each branch comes with a decoration card; these are defenses (e.g. Tinsel  barbed wire, Fairy lights  electric fence).  During their turn, players may play elf cards to form squads, then send the squads of elves to attack their neighbour, attempting to steal their presents.&#10;&#10;Elf Defense uses the mechanics of a Magic: the Gathering circle of death to allow any number of players to join in, without significant downtime.&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;A player is eliminated when they have no presents remaining.
