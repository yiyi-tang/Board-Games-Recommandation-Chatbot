In turn, each player/team rolls two six-sided dice, leave start, and advance around the outer track in either direction.  A player/team may roll a die and advance again when answering a question about religion correctly. There are two sets of question cards. One set for beginners; another set for advanced players. Each card contains six questions. The asker simply asks the next question on the card. The correct response is on the back of the card. There is no penalty for a wrong answer. However, if while taking one&rsquo;s turn that player says, &ldquo;Yeah, but&rdquo; then the player&rsquo;s pawn is sent back to the starting space.&#10;&#10;Players must follow the instructions on any space on which one&rsquo;s pawn rests. A player may not advance a second pawn until the first pawn has reached Home of Humility (finish). The third pawn may not be moved until the second pawn has reached the finish space.  A pawn does not have to reach the finish space by exact count. Any unused movement points are given to the next pawn. The first player/team to get all three of one's pawns to the finish is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

However now you must race and battle opponents, slip past security guards, dodge bullets, avoid lasers, find the crystal and escape to safety with your prize, for in this safe, nobody is safe.&#10;&#10;This is a print and play game with a 5-piece double-sided modular board, originally created for the 2017 Nine Card Nano-game Print and Play contest. The rules for setting up the game are quite loose allowing for many variations and levels of play. You can even make up your own special rules for the boards you make (for example you must touch all five cards of the board before leaving the vault). You can overlap boards, you can use less than 5 boards, you can use the sample boards in the rules, you can decide how many security guards to play with (if there are less players you could even use the unused player meeples as security guards for extra challenge), you can decide if you want to use the holographic crystal, etc. the point of it is, get creative. Once you have a board set up, you and the other players must race to grab the crystal while dodging around walls, avoiding lasers and security guards, and dueling each other to grab the crystal out of the hands of the opponent. Then you must get back to the vault door and punch in the code to escape into the night with your prize.&#10;&#10;In addition to printing the files for this game you will also need:&#10;-4 different colored meeples&#10;-3 black meeples&#10;-2 acrylic crystals&#10;-3 green d6s&#10;-3 red d6s&#10;-1 black d6&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The card backs of the Super-Villains each form a portion of the giant merged castle, with The Joker's head at the top.&#10;&#10;Each Super-Villain has colors on its four sides matching the main card types: Hero, Villain, Super Power, and Equipment. During your turn, if there is a card matching one of those types in the Line-Up, you must take the card and place it next to the corresponding side of the Super-Villain. When you defeat a Super-Villain, instead of placing it in your deck, you earn each card attached to it.&#10;&#10;The new keyword &quot;Ninjutsu&quot; provides the heroes some much-needed help as they take on the fearful might of the combined Super-Villains' super castle!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deepwater is a solo game set in the year 2047 - in which the player assumes the role of a tech billionaire taking over a loss-making, underwater, deep-sea research and farming facility, six months after an industrial accident at the base released a crystalline, genetically engineered mutagen named &quot;Zenobia&quot; into the sea.&#10;&#10;During each game, the player will have to recruit marine biologists, deep-sea engineers, offshore operations staff, and security personnel. As the game progresses, the player will also have many opportunities to build onto their facility, and develop superior underwater tech and submersibles - to help achieve their character-specific goals. Will the player be a philanthropist, or a greedy business magnate, for example.&#10;&#10;Many dangerous situations will arise throughout the game, which the player will have to make tough decisions to overcome - including underwater earthquakes, superstructure fails, flooding, intrusions by Eco-terrorists, and shark attacks. The multiple choice nature of these hazards will lead to the player having to sacrifice resources, cash, crew, and moral standing - with potentially devastating environmental impact.&#10;Deepwater presents a tense, suspenseful, narrative-focused adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The next player will try to guess the correct gift tile, and so on, until one finds the correct tile. The game continues with the next player clockwise: taking a new letter card trying to find the corresponding gift in the box. The game ends when the players match all gift tiles with corresponding letter cards. The winner is the one who collected the highest number of letter cards.&#10;&#10;Which are the available places on the Christmas Tree? Each level of the tree is divided in 4 sectors: players should place gift tiles of the same colours on each sector of the levels. The colour is determined by the Christmas Ball picture on each sector. Furthermore, each sector of the lowest level can have max. 3 gift tiles, in the middle level max. 2 gift tiles and in the highest level just 1.&#10;Attention: If a player, while placing a gift tile on the Christmas Tree, makes one or more tiles fall down, they loose the just gained letter card, which has to be given to another played (they can choose whom). Fallen gift tiles should be placed back in the box with remaining tiles: increasing the difficulty of the game.&#10;&#10;",

How far can your path go? You'll have to see for yourself!&#10;&#10;You're creating a spacious garden surrounded by Sakura trees, but you have a limited number of tiles to play. Create a longer path and a larger garden by winding through Sakura trees: each pass acquires additional tiles for your expanding garden.&#10;&#10;Should you risk your limited tiles to set up a valuable move, divert your opponents' paths away from the Sakura trees, or focus on an easy path through another Sakura tree? Weighing what to pursue when provides a mental challenge for those who hope to master it.&#10;&#10;How is it different than the web game?&#10;&#10;A few game rules deliberately changed to fit better for table play, but all the components are there if you really just want to experience a real-life version of the digital game. Here are the major changes:&#10;The board game focuses on the limited-tile play of the Sakura-flavored Entanglement maps, not the boundary-based maps of classic Entanglement. This change makes initial setup much easier and prevents pre-placed tiles from shifting off-grid when they're not adjacent to other tiles.&#10;Sakura tiles are dealt into players' hands instead of being pre-placed on the board. (This is for the same reason given in #1, and also adds a little more strategy and variety.)&#10;Scoring is based on the total length of completed lines instead of on the length of individual moves. This change helps the game move a bit faster, since tallying scores like the web game isn't terribly fun to do manually.&#10;The lines are thicker, and they don't glow. The thin lines were confusing to follow visually, and I didn't want the game to be radioactive.&#10;&#10;Components: Box; 72 Hex Tiles; Rules Document; 6 (different colored) Pawns&#10;&#10;",

Along the way, talking animals help players solve the mystery of the stolen item with the help of a treasure chest that randomly supplies clues on behalf of the animals. Whenever players meet animals, they must feed them so the animals &mdash; that can be understood only by children &mdash; can provide the clues that advance gameplay. The clues supplied by the electronic treasure chest ensure that no two games are alike.

The first trial is the Iocus Arcanus, a coliseum where the mages have no control over the magic and its luck that accompanies those destined to continue the path of the sages. The second trial, Draconis Arcanus, the search for the feather of the fenix dragon. And the last test, Arcanum Regem, the hardest and the one that really shows if the apprentices can lead the kingdom of Xrathgar.&#10;&#10;The First Trial is held in this crazy coliseum, where the arcane energy transforms from one type to another. The apprentices will obtain different knowledge and the one who is able to learn them all, will win this trial. Of course, the other apprentices will not let you win, throwing away your soul from the coliseum, geting you out of the trial.&#10;&#10;Simple rules, funny and full of magic, perfect for a family boardgame night!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If they wish to do so, that&rsquo;ll cost the team 1 minute, or otherwise said, one action card. This means that there's no dominant player who influences the others and that players need to be resourceful and rely on the judgment of the team members.&#10;If a team succeeds in escaping the room, the amount of remaining action cards state how many minutes were left to go. In that way, teams can challenge each other in having time records.&#10;&#10;There are 4 possible actions:&#10;&#10;     Solve a puzzle: place a corresponding trait card (i.e. 'perceptive', 'dexterous', 'talkative', 'tenacious' or 'logical') next to puzzle.&#10;     Move to another puzzle: choose and discard a trait/action card from your hand and move to any visible puzzle.&#10;     Replenish cards: Fill up your hand to 5 cards and then discard a card.&#10;     Ask a question: Discard the top card from the draw pile and ask a closed-ended question.&#10;&#10;&#10;With adapted rules for 2 players and solo mode!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Cthulhu&rsquo;s appearance is imminent. The world as we know it is doomed.&#10;&#10;However, we&rsquo;ve got one last chance! Investigators travel to the realms of R'lyeh itself in an attempt to destroy Cthulhu in transit between the two worlds!&#10;&#10;In this final episode, the action takes place on Cthulhu as the board itself. with figures moving freely upon the terrain with the aid of a movement ruler. Investigators must defeat Cthulhu one stage at a time, like a regular Elder One fight - except they may only attack one area of the Elder One at a time.&#10;&#10;R'lyeh Rising comes with its own Mythos deck featuring additional Monster summoning and unspeakable events generated by Cthulhu&rsquo;s presence.

    "Description": "Fields of Fortune is a press-your-luck card game of medieval city-building.&#10;&#10;In the game, players attempt to build the most prosperous city while avoiding barbarian raids. The game consists of a 102-card fortune deck, with most cards being beneficial to a player's city, such as castles, city squares, military structures, religious structures, and treasuries. However, the deck also contains barbarian horde cards of varying strength that may result in a raid.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they may choose to either hire mercenaries (if available) or add cards to the field. A player adds cards to the field by turning over cards from the fortune deck, one at a time and laying them out in the play area between all players (the field). The player may continue to add cards to the field until they choose to stop, barbarians raid the field, or eight cards are in the field. When a player chooses to stop, they then choose up to three cards from the field to add to their city. The cards are sorted in the player's city by type as the player is trying to maximize points by completing sets of the different types.&#10;&#10;Each barbarian horde card has a strength value of 1-3. A barbarian raid occurs when a player is adding cards to the field and a total of 5 or more strength points worth of barbarian horde cards is revealed. When this happens, the field is swept (all cards are removed to the discard pile) and the player's turn immediately ends.&#10;&#10;Alternately, instead of adding cards to the field, a player may choose to hire mercenaries if there are any available in the general supply. Mercenaries will help the player defend against barbarian raids by destroying barbarian horde cards in the field of equal or lesser value, just as a player's regular army cards do. A player who chooses to hire mercenaries may still collect cards from the field, if any, that were previously placed there by another player.&#10;&#10;When the fortune deck runs out and no mercenaries cards are left in the supply, the player with the most points based on all cards in their city wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The safe and protected treasure are considered locked if a lock icon appears on the safe card.  A locked safe blocks opponents from stealing the treasure, but prevents you from extending it on future turns.  An unlocked safe allows you to later extend the treasure for big points, but leaves it vulnerable to steals.&#10;&#10;Bluffing about the state of your safe cards is encouraged, particularly if it increases the uncertainty in your opponents&rsquo; minds as to which of your treasures are locked.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded at the end of the game based on the size of each banked treasure.  Press your luck to create large melds and a huge score.  Players earn bonus points for Gold treasure, blocked steals, and unlocked safe cards.  The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Roll up your sleeves &ndash; it&rsquo;s time to start a rumpus!&#10;&#10;Rumpus is a pocket-sized betting card game that is incredibly easy to learn and play. Aggress other players to show what a desirable gentleman you really are &ndash; but don&rsquo;t pick a fight you can&rsquo;t win! Oh, and please don&rsquo;t start an actual fight. You are better than that.&#10;&#10;In Rumpus, each player draws three cards, then chooses one card to place face-up in front of them so it is visible to the other players. Each card will consist of one of three symbols - Bicycle, Mustache, and Top Hat. At the beginning of each turn, the player with the Your Turn card must choose an opponent to fight. The players not involved in the fight may place a bet on who they think will win; be careful though, your bet cards will be lost if your fighter loses the fight.&#10;&#10;The fighting players will select cards from their hand of a single symbol to play. Once both players are ready, they will reveal their selected cards to see who wins the fight. The player with the most of symbols of their suit wins the fight; in the case of a tie, there is a listing of which symbols are most effective against another symbol in the instructions (think Rock-Paper-Scissors). The winner will take a Victory Card and must read the description on the card out loud (e.q. &quot;Good Show!&quot;); the other players who bet on the winner will take their bet cards back and draw an additional card from the deck that can be used for future fights.&#10;&#10;Once all of the Victory Cards have been drawn, the game is over, and the player with the most Victory Cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Highly adaptable, these creatures are often mistaken for a standard Warrior until it is too late for their enemies. Some of them are able to spray acid at close range onto multiple enemies at once, others can camouflage their exoskeleton to blend into their surroundings to leap upon their foes, and some of them are even able to heal the most grievous of wounds almost instantly.&#10;&#10;Classified as Evolved Warriors, company scientists believe they are an evolutional dead-end and once their metamorphosis has finished, it will change no more after that. It is theorized that their evolution is due to an immediate need that the hive requires, but not as a long term creation. Whatever the reasoning is behind these monsters, they should be engaged with extreme caution, as each one is different and there is no way to determine what capabilities it has until it has displayed them.&#10;&#10;Box contains:&#10;&#10;2x resin UniCast miniatures with scenic bases&#10;1x stat card&#10;2x ping Tokens&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A fast, fun, zombie-themed retro-style card game featuring a flying pig and a unicorn riding a tank! Be the first to build your horde and bask in the ultimate glory of awesome victory. Sounds easy, but your opponents will not just stand by and let you win. No, they want to block and quarantine your precious horde, so they must be defeated at all costs. It's a life and death struggle that only the greatest, coolest and super nice will survive.&#10;     Gameplay mainly involves turn-based drawing and playing cards. Players start and grow their horde by placing cards of the same color in numerical sequence one through ten, but other players will attempt to hinder their progress by blocking, curing, and quarantining. There is even a Zomb-Fish card which allows you to steal a card from another player. The game usually intensifies as one player gets closer and closer to completing their horde, which usually ramps up the &ldquo;take that&rdquo; element of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Setting &amp; Theme: The cursus honorum was the sequential order of public offices held by aspiring politicians in the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. This game simulates those career paths, with senatorial factions represented by each player, during the rise of the Republic. Starting around 241-237 BC when the provinces of Sicilia and Sardinia et Corsica had been conquered through war with the Carthaginians, each turn abstracts a generation of Roman politicians competing for offices and wielding state powers, with factions leveraging their wealth and influence to increase their reputation and legacy. Senators also serve in provincial posts, protecting and developing the expanding Republic while amassing their own fame and fortune. Throughout the game players must cooperate to ensure the public&rsquo;s satisfaction with the government remains stable and the Republic remains prosperous and secure, all while competing to attain the highest status.&#10;&#10;General Course of Play: Each turn begins with die rolls triggering events in the provinces. Then elections are held where factions compete to form the strongest voting coalitions and senators claim offices in Rome and the provinces. Players then alternate taking actions that include using office powers and influencing clients, often with adverse effect on their opponents. Each turn concludes with a sequential reckoning of state and faction accounts, setting the stage for the next generation of struggle and achievement.&#10;&#10;Disclaimer: This is a updated prototype that has been play tested, but is still in development.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the year 2018, France finds itself, under the pretext of progressivism, on the verge of turning to  authoritarian rule.&#10;A handful of parliament members opposed to the neo-liberal regime seek to counter the corrupt presidency by denouncing its abuses of power and blocking the passage of oppressive laws.&#10;Meanwhile, the government has begun to create a private militia to obey its orders, thanks to the help of a shadowy figure: Alexandre Benalla.&#10;&#10;Secret Benalla is a game of deception, lies and betrayal. The players are either opponents of Emmanuel the 1st who win by uncovering the corruption and unmasking Alexandre Benalla, Macronists who win by passing the oppressive laws of the authoritarian regime, or Opportunists who each have unique win conditions that are sometimes ... hard to decipher !&#10;&#10;Be careful - even your allies may betray you.  Keen observation, scrutiny, and logical reasoning will lead players to triumph, but maybe not a triumph for democracy.&#10;&#10;Secret Benalla is a re-implementation of Secret Hitler based on a 2018 French political scandal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
