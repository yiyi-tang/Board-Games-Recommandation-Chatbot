    "Description": "A blackbox is a device, system, or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, or transfer characteristics, without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is &quot;opaque&quot; &ndash; or black. This kind of system may exchange matter with its environment. The term originates from military signal engineering and originally designated enemy equipment that was not meant to be opened due to the danger of booby traps.&#10;&#10;Similarly, or not at all, this game is new and different each time you play it. You know for sure that you will put some time in, and hopefully get some fun out of it. Rest assured, however, that no incendiary devices are included.&#10;&#10;This game originates from the urge to create a versatile modular sandbox simulation of a boring Euro game, also known as cube-pusher, or JASE (just another soulless euro), with the aim to re-create any of these games, and mashing them up as preferred, or not. Luckily, it got a bit sidetracked in development and while I hope, or fear, its ancestry still shines through, it became more of a beast of its own.&#10;&#10;Blackbox consists of a large number of Modules, all of which plug into the Proto Module, and the exact composition of which decides how the game you play this time actually works, which mechanisms you will get to use, how you will score and a variety of other variables.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

While most of play is building up an interesting story, there's also a strategic component to which aspect of the story you focus on, as that affects scoring at the end.&#10;&#10;Each scenario has four keywords; for example, the first scenario is &quot;The Dragon's Cave&quot; and some keywords are &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Traps&quot;, and &quot;Treasure&quot;. Each keyword starts with two &quot;shadows&quot;, or black stones. Each turn a player pulls a jewel from a bag and uses the color of the jewel plus a keyword to tell part of the story. The keyword they choose to use determines where they place the jewel, and the color of the jewel determines the next player.&#10;&#10;For example, if you pick a red jewel and then choose the &quot;Treasure&quot; keyword, you might say &quot;there's a legend that there's a giant ruby at the bottom of this cave&quot;. Over the course of the game you'll build on elements introduced by the other players.&#10;&#10;You get points by getting rid of shadows, but also for each stone of your color on the board at the end of the game. You remove stones from the board by adding stones to keywords that already have three stones on them, so as the game progresses you'll have a choice between getting rid of shadows to get points directly or removing jewels belonging to other players to reduce their points. You'll have to balance both of these aspects to come out ahead.&#10;&#10;Besides scenario-based competitive play, rules for non-competitive &quot;free play&quot; are also included.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One player is a spy and other players (detectives) try to find him. The spy marks its hiding place in the spy booklet but does not show it to the others. Then the hourglass is turned and the game can start.&#10;&#10;Other players try to find the hiding place of the spy from the board. Three cards are revealed. Those are the tools that the detectives can use. When all three cards are used, new three cards are revealed. They refer to different areas on the board. Are you on this row? Are you on the same space with cars or water? Seekers mark the spaces where the spy is not and try to find the correct space.&#10;&#10;Different tools take different time to use (the time in minutes is marked on cards). If the hourglass is turned the seekers get a penalty minute. The spy gets as many points as it takes in minutes for the seekers to find. All players play once as a spy and the winner is the player who gets most points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Father Tilly is a set of wargames rules designed to re-fight the battles of the Thirty Years War.&#10;&#10;The rules are aimed at players with 25/28mm figures to fight both small scale encounters all the way up to larger battles.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are fast and simple and allow players to quickly resolve shooting or melee with hardly a glance back to the rules. &#10;In addition to the rules system there are a number of cards or &quot;war-tokens&quot; that players use to complement the action on the table. The skilled use of these tokens allow players to further influence the game play but they also introduce an element of risk: powder explosions, drunken generals, mutinies and looting soldiers are all hazards that players have to face. The advantage of using the &quot;war-tokens&quot; (other than the sheer level of fun that they introduce) is that they allow some of the more unforeseen and random events to occur without clogging up the game mechanics with added lengthy rules.&#10;&#10;In addition to the Father Tilly rules comes the first of several supplements: &#10;The Bohemian Revolt covers the early stages of the war and includes army lists, generals profiles, a Battle of White Mountain scenario and additional &quot;war-tokens&quot; specifically designed for this early period.   &#10;My aim when writing Father Tilly was not to create a generic set of &quot;pike &amp; shot&quot; rules that covers hundreds of years of European warfare but to concentrate specifically on the fascinating, surprisingly varied and brutal conflict known as the Thirty Years War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bloody Kingdom is a set of wargames rules designed for the Civil Wars of Britain, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.&#10;&#10;Bloody Kingdom uses the same game mechanics as Father Tilly - although with several important differences.&#10;&#10;Players can fight battles at two different scales, either large battles with numerous regiments per side or smaller lower scale engagements where each unit represents a company rather than a regiment.&#10;&#10;The basing for these rules are flexible. Players can either use individually based 25/28mm figures or blocks of figures on one base, however, the rules do require the removal of figures so each unit should have at least a few spare figures for casualty removal. When units suffer hits figures are only removed after each suffers four &quot;kills&quot;, this means that great handfuls of figures are not removed with each volley. But ten or twenty percent casualties in a unit does represent significant damage and a significant risk to morale.&#10;&#10;The rules contain a detailed method of generating armies which includes the composition, weaponry and tactics of each unit in addition to the leadership qualities, experience and levels of training of each unit. &#10;The rules also include several sample armies that give players &quot;ready to use&quot; pointed-up forces for all of the main factions involved in the Civil War.&#10;&#10;As with the Father Tilly rules, the &quot;war-tokens&quot; are also a major feature of Bloody Kingdom and provide an extra layer of period feel and fun, adding such diverse elements as powder explosions, drunken generals, turncoats and court astrologers to the game. &#10;Finally, Bloody Kingdom includes an Edgehill scenario with detailed army lists, a map and unit cards for each of the units involved in the battle.&#10;&#10;So if you like a game that emphasises tactics, command, morale and a bit of fun and you like the English Civil War - Bloody Kingdom could be the rules for you, what am I saying - these are the rules for you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bad War is the fourth set of wargame rules using the AB One system.&#10;&#10;Previous titles include Father Tilly which covers the Thirty Years War and Bloody Kingdom, a set of English Civil War rules. &#10;Bad War is designed to cover warfare in the sixteenth century, a period which seems from this distance to offer the wargamer a terrifically interesting and colourful selection of gaming opportunities. Full of garishly dressed soldiers, colourful and exotic troop types and with the introduction of the firearm, the beginnings of modern warfare. &#10;Armies struggled to find a way of incorporating this new technology, much time was devoted to experimentation with battlefield tactics and still the tried and tested methods of medieval warfare produced dramatic victories. Few could stand against the awesome charge of the French Gendarmes nor face the ferocious onslaught of the Swiss pike-square. And yet warfare did evolve during this period. The arquebus and musket do replace the bow and crossbow, knights begin to put aside their lances and take up the pistol.&#10;&#10;What I have attempted with Bad War is to bring out the qualities of some of these more exotic troops, the Doppels&ouml;ldner, the Aventuriers, the Black Bands, the Gendarmes, the Landsknechts, the Stradiots and the Condottieri. &#10;Rather than a simple factor rating their quality, these troops have different characteristics that shape and modify their actions. Gendarmes are likely to disobey orders and attack their nearest opponents, the Swiss will seek out any Landsknechts and visit bloody slaughter on their foe and any Stradiots can certainly be relied upon to loot the baggage train - either their opponents or their own!&#10;&#10;Bad War can be played with either 25/28mm or 15mm figures and a wide variety of popular basing is allowed. &#10;The rules have many similar features to the other AB One games including the entertaining &quot;War-Tokens system&quot;.&#10;&#10;Also provided is a Fornovo scenario which includes a map, order of battle and unit cards that can be printed out for use during the game and army lists for the Early Italian Wars. &#10;Although Bad War focuses initially on the Italian Wars, the rules can be used for any European warfare of the sixteenth century. Later supplements will cover the French Wars of Religion, the Spanish and Dutch war and the wars of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Escalade is a set of skirmish rules designed for keen Father Tilly players - and anyone else interested in seventeenth-century warfare. Escalade takes the basic mechanics used in Father Tilly and incorporates that extra layer of detail required for battles at the skirmish level. &#10;The rules feature organisation at the company level and focus on the role of officers and NCOs in low level engagements. Also included in the rules are a number of different troop types: those interesting and exotic units that are too small or rare to feature in most big battles. Players can field units of J&auml;gers, Sh&uuml;tzen, Sturmtruppen and Trabanten.&#10;&#10;For the experienced Father Tilly player, Escalade contains several familiar features. &#10;Rules for movement, morale, shooting and combat have the same basic mechanics but with additional detail. &#10;The sections on terrain and scenario generation are also included plus a new section detailing mortars, incendiaries and other methods of mayhem and destruction. &#10;The popular &quot;war-tokens&quot; section is also included, this describes how players can use their existing Father Tilly tokens and apply them to skirmish games. &#10;And because of the more uncertain nature of skirmish games, the initiative system has been modified too.&#10;&#10;Despite its similarities to Father Tilly, Escalade is a game that can be played on its own without any prior experience of other AB One games. &#10;Players of Father Tilly will already be familiar with many of its processes, however, new players will quickly find an easy to use, exciting and enjoyable system ideally suited to fighting skirmish level games in the seventeenth century.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This game can be played with up to two or three players per side. &#10;     And finally, the last scenario covers the Battle of Lech. This is a large battle requiring around two hundred and fifty figures per side, three to four players per side plus a good five or six hours gaming.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Lech scenario is based around a river crossing under heavy enemy fire and contains special rules for boats, bridges and other details that allow such actions. Players will need to have a copy of the Swedish War gaming supplement for the details of Swedish generals, troops and tactics, in order to properly use these scenarios.&#10;&#10;The Battle on the Lech was Tilly's final battle. Defending a river crossing to prevent the Swedish forces from crossing into Bavarian territory, the old Catholic general suffered a fatal wound while encouraging his beleaguered troops to stand fast in the face of punishing Swedish artillery fire. Will the Imperial army suffer the same fate as the historical outcome or can they deliver a major reverse to the great Swedish king?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Grand Ambition is another set of rules that uses the AB One system.&#10;&#10;Having covered the Thirty Years War period and the English Civil War with previous versions, I wanted to finish off the seventeenth century by covering the wars of James II, Louis XIV and William III. &#10;This later period saw the rise of the standing army: regular troops, funded by the state and employed all year round. &#10;This period also saw significant developments in weaponry and tactics and it is these changes that I hope are reflected in the rules. &#10;Included in the Grand Ambition rule book are sections detailing with the organisation of troops and the type of formations and tactics deployed.&#10;&#10;All of the rules necessary to run the game including Initiative, Game Sequence and Movement, Shooting and Combat, Orders and Morale for individual units and the army as a whole, plus extensive army lists can be found here. &#10;In addition to this is the section describing the war-tokens and their usage plus a system regulating the deployment of armies and a system for generating battlefield terrain.&#10;&#10;Towards the rear of the rules can be found a section for converting the game to lower level &quot;company actions&quot; plus a method for generating scenarios for smaller scale engagements.&#10;&#10;Finally, the rules provide a scenario to use with the Grand Ambition rules which includes a map and order of battle for the game.&#10;&#10;And finally finally, not forgetting the war-tokens themselves which players can print-off and use in their Grand Ambition games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Six scenarios are included in this supplement - with a brief summary below:&#10;&#10;     Scenario One:&#10;&#10;&#10; Contributions, a scenario of slash and burn tactics involving a collection of devious and untrustworthy characters - and the enemy aren't too nice either!&#10;&#10;     Scenario Two:&#10;&#10;&#10; The Peasants are Revolting, a desperate battle to survive between fleeing soldiers and murderous bands of peasants. Can heroics save the day or will it be better to run, run, RUN!&#10;&#10;     Scenario Three:&#10;&#10;&#10; Rescue Rupert, a game of suspicious guards, tough mercenaries and rebel fanatics and a daring attempt to free Prince Rupert from the dastardly clutches of the Emperor.&#10;&#10;     Scenario Four:&#10;&#10;&#10; Assault on Bastion 13, an intense and bloody assault on a well-entrenched enemy. Choose your weapons: mortars, grenades, snipers? Can you be the first hero to breach the enemies defences?&#10;&#10;     Scenario Five:&#10;&#10;&#10;  Escalade, a frantic attempt to break out from the stranglehold of the enemies siege-lines. Will our heroes manage to escape before the enemy (industriously slaughtering civilians) can assemble to foil their escape?&#10;&#10;     Scenario Six:&#10;&#10;&#10;Bandit Country, valuable supplies must get through to beleaguered troops, even if this means moving the wagons through this dark and ominously silent wood. But wait a moment, what's that blocking the path up ahead, a fallen tree? Did that tree just fall down, is that the glint of a gun-barrel pocking through the trees? The horses are getting nervous! Are the enemy about to attack...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The arabic word &quot;Azzelij&quot; means &quot;small polished stone&quot; and is known as the historical origin of the world &quot;Tile&quot;.&#10;&#10;In Azzelij, two to four players compete to build a beautiful tile panel, trying to get more points with your own colors.&#10;&#10;Each player have 12 tile pieces at their stock pile that are used do form circle patterns, like an artist trying to get the best part of the pannel! At first round, each player get 3 tiles from their pile and than draw one each subsequent round, maintaining 3 options to play at almost all time. In your turn, you must place one tile (considering that you cant extend the panel mor than 7x7 tiles away) and optionally rotate 90&ordm; clockwise another placed tile (only if the rotated tile is not forming a circle pattern yet). The turns goes until the 7x7 panel is created.&#10;&#10;You score one point creating circle patterns with absolute majority of your colour and 3 points if the circle created has only your color. You also score bonus points (1 for each circle) if the scored circle is created only by your pieces.&#10;&#10;Ar fisrt glance, Azzelij seems to be a simple tile placement, but as the game flows players faces lots of hard decisions to make: May I get a point or avoid another player to get a better position? May I close the 7 piece limit to stop opponents to grow at one edge or stay creating my pattern? May I risk to get a full-colored circle of mine or get two or more majority-only circle points?&#10;&#10;As the game flows, the decisions ar harder to take and the panel gets its 7x7 piece formation, that increases the difficulty and fun!&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The second edition incorporates an expansion that was formerly only available as a print &amp; play. This expansion introduces task cards with patterns. Placing your tiles in a way that they form these patterns will score extra points.&#10;&#10;",

The game&rsquo;s box innovatively opens into game components, the jeep and the bunker. Whimsical cartoon soldiers illustrated by Monte M. Moore make the game as attractive as it is enjoyable.&#10;&#10;Group your soldiers into stacks containing sergeants and generals to increase your stack multiplier. Soldiers landing face down are injured, but can still be scored if you reach them with your medic. Cards that are flipped or dropped into the central bunker score double. Evacuate your high scoring stack before your opponent drops the bomb, get the highest score and win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Barbarossa &ndash; Kicking in the Door&hellip; is a wargames campaign covering the German invasion of the Soviet Union between June and September 1941. &#10;It is designed for games in which a stand represents a platoon, such as Blitzkrieg Commander, Command Decision: TOB, A Fistful of Tows, Rapid Fire and others, including those which wargamers may have written themselves.&#10;&#10;The system generates 150+ hours of gaming spread over 50+ individual battles which are fought over fifteen weekly campaign turns. Bookkeeping is kept to a minimum as players take command of four of the German panzer divisions spearheading the invasion or the Soviet tank and infantry forces opposing them. Straightforward German attacks will be interspersed with Soviet counterattacks, storming city outskirts, holding bridgeheads or trying to break through the fortifications of the Stalin Line. Each type of battle has its own terrain specifications, victory conditions, set up restrictions and likely opposition. Individual battles are reinforced regimental/brigade sized, with some battalions of each division selected to fight whilst others are rested.&#10;&#10;In addition to managing the individual battles, however, the German player also needs to manage the campaign. Ever increasing Soviet resistance needs to be curtailed by encircling their forces. Such encirclements reduce the availability of &lsquo;mobilisation points&rsquo; which the Soviet players use as currency to &lsquo;buy&rsquo; greater or better equipped forces and fortifications with which the slow the German advance. A rapid, deep advance, however, will exact a heavy toll in attrition. Supply will also become a problem for the German players, limiting the numbers they can commit to battle and their artillery/air support.&#10;&#10;The book also includes&#10;&#10;     a brief history of the campaign&#10;     background information (such as time and groundscale) useful in adapting the system to different sets of rules and some suggestions for additional optional rules&#10;     a system for generating table layouts for individual battles&#10;     a comprehensive set of Appendices covering&#10;         the Tables of Organisation and Equipment to both platoon and company level for all divisions and regiments involved&#10;         42 colour terrain squares to assist in creating the terrain for individual battles&#10;         a worked example of the terrain generation system&#10;         a Campaign Quick Reference Sheet&#10;         an example Campaign Turn&#10;         a complete set of very quick play rules&#10;         a full colour A4 Campaign Map&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Barbarossa &ndash; Kicking in the Door&hellip; is an ideal campaign for a club (with eight of more players for twelve or more three hour sessions) or one to be organised remotely, by e-mail, with shorter options available for fewer players or those with less time available.&#10;&#10;For those who have purchased the author&rsquo;s previous book of eastern front scenarios (Grey Steel, Red Storm &ndash; available on Wargame Vault) please note that around seven pages of history and background from that book are reproduced largely unchanged in Part One of this volume.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
