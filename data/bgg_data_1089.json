    "Description": "Due to a distortion in the space-time continuum, six characters from different time periods have been brought to Ki-pataw in the year of 1937. Players take on these characters on a mission to collect specific items/energies they need and go to the designated place in order to return to the time period from which they came. Alternatively, they can encounter other characters and choose to remain in Ki-pataw instead. The choice is for you, the players, to make.&#10;&#10;In The Tales of Ki-pataw, each player plays as one of six characters: capybara, modern girl, man from the future, witch, Japanese soldier, and tribal youth. Each character has their own missions to find the way home. During a player's turn, players perform the following actions in order: movement, encounter, visit, and preparation:&#10;&#10;1. Movement phase:&#10;During this phase, you can play any number of cards from your hand and move your character meeple accordingly.&#10;&#10;2. Encounter phase:&#10;During the Movement phase, if your character passes other characters, you must choose from one of the three following actions for the final player-controlled character encountered:&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139;Take an encounter token from said character and place it on an empty spot in the encounter area of your character board;&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139;Place one of your character&rsquo;s encounter token on an empty spot in the encounter area of said character&rsquo;s character board;&#10;&#226;&#151;&#139;Exchange one encounter token with the other player controlling said character and place the exchanged token on an empty spot in the encounter area of your character board (and vice versa)&#10;&#10;3. Visit phase:&#10;During this phase, you can perform the unique attraction action where your character meeple is currently located. For descriptions on each attraction action, refer to the corresponding section later in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;4.Preparation phase:&#10;During this phase, you can choose to keep any number of cards in your hand and discard the remaining to the discard pile; draw from your character deck until you have three cards in your hand before ending your turn for the current round.&#10;&#10;In this game, a player may win two ways: A solo victory in which the player fulfills the conditions to return their chosen character to their original timeline, or a shared victory in which two players win together by choosing to remain in Ki-pataw instead of returning home.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ki-pataw&quot; is the name that the plains indigenous people who lived in the area used to call New Beitou. The term, which is a Ketagalan word, means &quot;witch&quot;. It came about because of folk legends on silhouette of woman people claimed to have witnessed, probably caused by the steam from the geothermal valley.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns as the farmer with a simple task: Sell their handgrown cucumbers to the merchants and make an honest living out of it. The goal of the game is to earn the most profits through successful deals.&#10;&#10;All is well except that a creature called Kancil &mdash; a creature who often disguises itself as a merchant &mdash; pretends to negotiate business deals with the farmer, while in fact, Kancil would break the whole deal in the end and steal all the earnings away!&#10;&#10;Kancil originates from an Indonesian folklore. In the folklore, Kancil is the farmer's arch nemesis as Kancil always steals the farmer's cucumbers away. In this game, Kancil's craftiness is upgraded to a whole new level.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For the two player version, please go here: Tokyo Highway&#10;&#10;In Tokyo Highway, players compete to place all of their cars on the road first &mdash; but to do that they have to build the roadways so that they have somewhere for their cars to go!&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players construct columns of varying heights by using the 88 squat gray and yellow pillars in the box, then connect those columns with sticks that serve as roadways, with the column you create usually not being the same height as the one it's connected to. When you place a highway that passes under or over an existing highway, you get to (carefully!) place a car on that highway. Place a highway that both goes over and under other highways, and you can place two cars!&#10;&#10;The yellow cylinders allow you to create a column the same height as another while also allowing you to fork the roadway to create more twists and turns.&#10;&#10;The first player to place all ten of their cars &mdash; with or without using tweezers &mdash; wins!&#10;&#10;This version of Tokyo Highway includes both the original base game and the expansion that allows for games with up to four players &mdash; not to mention four buildings that give additional obstacles while trying to lay down the concrete.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Galactico is a game of intergalactic scale, in which players act as taxi drivers, delivering passengers to the most remote corners of galaxies. The world of the game is impregnated with references to loved and well-known characters, as well as stamps of science fiction.&#10;&#10;In Galaktico, you need to transport passengers from one space sector to another, at the end of the game getting victory points for satisfied customers (and penalty points for customers that you didn&rsquo;t take to the final destination). A total of 8 stops in the game, and they are responsible for special cards, laid out in a circle. With a different number of players, the routes change (green, yellow or pink).&#10;&#10;The second (and main) type of game cards are passengers. There are four types of them - the usual (with a white rim, bring 1 software), the rich (with a yellow border, bring 2 software), hares (with a red border, bring 2 software) and the Worthans (with a green border, do not bring victory points).&#10;&#10;The third type of cards - controllers. They do not bring points, but they help to catch hares.&#10;&#10;Before the start of the game, each player receives a chip, which is then placed on different route maps as starting points. In his turn, the player must do 4 actions:&#10;move your chip. You can only move to unoccupied stations;&#10;lay out new passengers. On the five cards of the previous sectors from the displaced chips, one new passenger appears, which are taken from the deck of passengers;&#10;disembarking passengers. A player can land (lay face down in front of him) any number of passengers per hand if their symbols match the symbols on the station map. There are a couple of nuances: if there is a controller card at the station, the player can land all the hares (even if their symbols do not match the station symbols); Wortana can be landed only where there is another Wortana (both Wortana go to a dump);&#10;make loading. The player picks up passengers from the station to 6, starting from the lowest one in the row of passengers.&#10;&#10;When the &ldquo;end of shift&rdquo; card comes out of the deck of passengers, the current lap is played, then another lap is played, and the players proceed to the calculation of victory points. Passengers landed bring 1 or 2 points, and passengers remaining in the hand take away points. The winner is the one who scores the most points.

None is more terrible than bestowing the title of &quot;Blessed&quot; on a member of the cult. The ritual is performed once a generation, and is the deciding proof of December's choice of the leader of His cult. During this, the chosen sacrifice is stripped of all humanity, transformed into a living expression of December's power ... and His all-encompassing hunger.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of her stewardship, Rasputina performed the ritual as December directed, choosing a young woman from the Silent Ones. It did not take long for the Ice Witch to regret going along with the ceremony, as she watch the woman become a prisoner in her own body. The Blessed retained more of her sanity than any in memory, and it became clear this was nothing more than a constant torment. This poor creature became one of the driving reasons for Rasputina's defiance of December, as she is forced to watch the poor wretch become more feral with each passing day.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Football is not only a game of X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s strategy, but also a game of mud and rain, of wind and frigid cold, of players adapting to the environment and mastering the elements to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Extreme cold has shaped the mythology of Pro Football, from the &ldquo;Ice Bowl&rdquo; in Green Bay to the &ldquo;Freezer Bowl&rdquo; in Cincinnati and &ldquo;Red Right 88&rdquo; in Cleveland. Snow, sleet, ice, and extreme cold change the conditions of the game and, as such, force coaches to adjust their strategies.&#10;&#10;Rain imbues football with an epic scope. Weather is the great equalizer, where elite athletes are hobbled by wet hands, soft earth, and standing water. Add in wind and you&rsquo;ve got &quot;football weather.&quot;&#10;&#10;With this new Breakaway Football: Weather Expansion, you can now experience these same epic coaching conditions at your own table.&#10;&#10;The expansion set includes three custom play mats themed for Rain, Snow, and Wind. To achieve the effect of playing in weather, the expansion features two new Game Day decks - one themed for &quot;Rain Day&quot; and another cold weather &quot;Snow Day&quot; -as well as forecast cards with specific modifiers for each weather condition.&#10;&#10;Wind is handled through new cards on the board that apply modifiers, making the kicking game more challenging. Strong enough wind can even affect the passing game.&#10;&#10;The rule book for the Weather Expansion not only outlines these new mechanisms but also includes two templates for the new weather decks, which allows one card pull to determine the specific game conditions (forecast, wind speed/direction, temperature).&#10;&#10;Experience epic drama in the elements with the Breakaway Football: Weather Expansion!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Transparent, colored tiles in the three primary colors red, blue and yellow result in the corresponding mixed colors by overlaying. A board, a bag and a color dice complete the materials.&#10;The child naturally discovers basic concepts of color theory, the larger ones make exciting games out of them and the adults have to be very careful when they want to win their tricky game.&#10;Include rules for 5 different games.&#10;&#10;This is mine!: 2-6 children throw with a color dice and have to  put the tile on the board. Mixed colors are formed by stacking. Is the color the right color, the player get a point.&#10;&#10;Tile away! 2-6 children first draw a tile, then the dice is thrown. If the tile can not be laid, it will be in your own stock. Next time you can use the new tile or a tile from your own stock.&#10;&#10;Who takes, wins! 2-6 children put all the tiles in the board. The game starts with 1 red,1 yellow, 1 blue, 2 green, 2 purple and 2 orange fields. Throw the dice and take the tile(s), if it is on the board or put the tile(s) on the board, if it is missed. The game ends, if all tiles are from the board.&#10;&#10;Criss-cross! 2-4 players draw tiles out the bag (2 tiles with 2 players, 3 tiles with 3 players etc.). All other tiles are seed on the board. Every turn you plays one tile and remove one tile or vice versa. You win the game, if you have one row with the same mixed color.&#10;&#10;Blue against red! 2 players use only 6 red and 6 blue tiles. It starts on the first and last row of the board. You win the game, if you complete the purple row in the middle. You can only draw your own color, but with purple you always take the top part. It does not matter if this part is red or blue.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Once defeated in a battle over territory, animals are forced out of the Savannah. But they are still watching for an opportunity to return to the Savannah.&#10;&#10;Return to Savannah is a tile placement game with a theme of great emigration of animals. In this game, players try to score points by placing animal tiles effectively.&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing an animal tile on a 4x4 square grid board. You must place an animal adjacent to another animal of the same type if any, expanding territory for that animal. If a type of animals are surrounded by other animals, they are forced to make a great emigration and removed from the board. At that moment the two leading players score points in the following manner.&#10;&#10;There are two leader tokens for each type of animals. These tokens move to certain players each time a tile of that type is placed. When that type of animals is removed, the token holders score points equal to the number of tiles removed or twice that number.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a certain number of migrations are made, and

These Tactics are increasingly powerful, and are unlocked by acquiring experience during a campaign;&#10;- Background information for each of the following factions: Adeptus Astartes, Deathwatch, Grey Knights, Astra Militarum, Adeptus Mechanicus, Heretic Astartes, Death Guard, Thousand Sons, Asuryani, Drukhari, Harlequins, Necrons, Orks, T&rsquo;au Empire, Tyranids, and Genestealer Cults.

Each umbrella is represented by a color chip(each color chip matched an umbrella). The chips are all turned face down, so their color are hidden and then shuffled. Each player takes a chip and looks at the hidden color it represents. All players must keep their chips face down in order to keep their umbrella hidden. The game then starts with the younger player&rsquo;s turn. The player takes the three colored dice and rolls them. Then he or she must move each umbrella according to the colors that came up in the dice. The umbrellas can be moved only forward and they can&rsquo;t pass over another umbrella or finish on another&rsquo;s umbrella&rsquo;s position. After the first player moves the selected umbrellas, then he passes the dice to the second younger player. The next players turn starts. The game ends when all the umbrellas enter one of the last blocks. Then the chips are turned up and their colors are revealed. The player whose chip represent the umbrella which finished first is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game has taken great inspiration from Ravensburger Snail's Pace Race.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Expanse Boardgame: Doors and Corners expansion contains five new modules &mdash; Leaders, New Tech, Resource Tokens, Protomolecule, and Variable Setup &mdash; that add an engaging element to the strategy and gameplay as players compete for dominance in the world of The Expanse. You can use any number of modules in any combination in conjunction with the base game.&#10;&#10;Leaders go with fleets and can add influence when they move with a fleet. New tech allows variety and surprise in what powers are available because when a tech is earned, you have three random choices for that tech. Resource tokens can be spent in several ways, including helping to pay CP costs, adding up to 4 AP to a card, moving up the initiative track, and earning bonus points for having the most at final scoring. Protomolecule adds a new scoring opportunity. Variable set-up allows fleets and influence to be placed anywhere at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The letters, groups of letters and free fields marked by the 6 balls when the wheel is stationary are called by the game master. All players now occupy the corresponding fields on their board with their chips. Freifelder allow the choice and use of any letter. Now we turn the hourglass and each player now tries as quickly as possible to form a common noun before the clock expires. The more letters or groups in a word, the higher the scoring. The winner is the one who has scored the most points after an agreed playing time or after a certain number of laps.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

In Town League Hockey, you will control either the Gold or Silver team and guide your players to the ultimate prize!&#10;&#10;Town League Hockey is a mid-weight game about playing a match of hockey. It was created to fill this niche because I found all hockey board games were either very light or very heavy. Town League Hockey is simple enough to learn in a few minutes, but deep enough that you will be mulling over your choices as you decide how to respond to on-ice events, where to skate with the puck to get the best shot, and when to rest or play your best players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Mana cubes in five colors are placed within easy reach of all players. The game then proceeds through three rounds consisting of: Preparation, battle, and totaling points.&#10;&#10;Preparation consists of laying out the enemy character for the round along with their damage cubes and each player taking a weapon card in their color. Four stacks of weapon cards are then placed on table. After one player shouts &quot;&quot;magiarma&quot;&quot;, play moves onto the battle phase. Players then race to grab weapon cards, build them using the mana cubes, and then roll their die to inflict damage on the current enemy. The battle comes to a close when all the enemy damage cubes have been collected by the players. Points are then awarded to the players based on the number of damage cubes they collected.&#10;&#10;The player who has amassed the most points is then named the winner.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#229;&#166;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#139;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;1&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#230;&#174;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#168;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#139;&#177;&#233;&#155;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Land of the Two Rivers is a game of the Iraq War in the post-invasion period starting roughly in Summer 2003. By this point Saddam's government had disintegrated and fateful decisions had already been made regarding official U.S. policy towards powerful factions within Iraq. The players are faced with the situation as it existed at that time, as the Sunni insurgency was building momentum, the Shia were taking advantage of the chaos to flex their long-suppressed muscle, and everyone was realizing there were insufficient U.S. forces to police the entire country. Regional and global entities like Syria, Turkey, Iran and Al Qaeda were attempting to shift events in their favor. The game does not provide the ability to alter what had already been done up to that point, but each player has options on how to conduct operations going forward.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for three players, representing:&#10;&#10;1. United States, British, Other Coalition, and Iraqi National Forces (INF)&#10;2. Sunnis (Iraqi Sunnis and their sponsors in the larger Sunni world)&#10;3. Shiites (Iraqi Shia and their sponsors in Iran)&#10;&#10;The U.S./Coalition objective is to stand up the Iraqi army in sufficient strength and effectiveness to control the majority of the country, with a small number of supporting U.S./Coalition troops.&#10;&#10;The Sunni and Shiite objectives are to gain control over enough of the population to give them a decisive advantage in the eventual political and economic solution that must one day be achieved.&#10;&#10;Players are free to cooperate and make (or break) any agreements they wish. However, there can only be one winner, so ultimately one player must outmaneuver the other two.&#10;&#10;The game has rules for U.S. Morale and Commitment similar to Nick Karp's classic &quot;Vietnam: 1965-1975&quot;, training of Iraqi National Forces (INF), Ground Attacks, IED Cells, Ambushes, Air Strikes, Al Qaeda unpredictability, Suicide Attacks, Coalition country withdrawals, Civilian Casualties, and more. There are sub-systems for the hunt for High Value Targets (HVTs), Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), and Infiltration of support from regional players.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It's a family game for 'gamer' families with multiple games in one box.&#10;&#10;At its most basic, it is a play-a-card-and-move-the-meeple party race game that lasts 10 to 15 minutes and can be picked up in a few minutes even by small children. The game has players perform fun real-life social challenges to reap in-game rewards.&#10;&#10;In its more advanced forms, it features tactical take-that and power-up cards, modular and constructable tracks, a variety of rule-altering pit-stops and an emergent power-up marketplace. Players can setup and duke it out in races that take up to an hour or even more to finish.&#10;&#10;The game is based on Oddbods, a Singaporean-British CGI-animated comedy television series produced by the Singapore-based studio One Animation.&#10;&#10;The series focuses on seven different, sometimes battling characters called the Oddbods - Fuse, Pogo, Zee, Jeff, Bubbles, Slick and Newt.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
