    "Description": "No Vacancies is a roll and write game where you take on the role of a Caravan Park owner. Four parks compete against each other to build the most infastructure, have the best attractions, book the most sites and attract the most customers.&#10;&#10;This is achieved by rolling six dice three times and making the best combinations you can. As your park fills up allocating all dice becomes harder and unused dice means areas must be eliminated. Bonus cards can come in two ways. Firstly by completing a section of the park such as powered sites, unpowered sites, pool side sites, cabins, infastructure or attractions. Secondly by matching all the sites listed on customer card.&#10;&#10;When your board is complete or all the customers are taken the game comes to an end. Add up all acquired sites and bonus cards to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;No Vacancies combines the chance of the roll, with the risk of pushing your luck for bigger and better rewards. Strategy comes in the choices between completing sections, chasing customers or going for the big attractions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The batter chooses a batting card, both players reveal their cards, and roll the die. &#10;3. Compare the roll to the # on the pitcher's card; if it's less, check the pitcher's card to see where the ball goes, otherwise use the batter's card.  If the fielder pawn is there, it's an out, otherwise it's a hit!&#10;4. The batter may try to extend the play and advance the runner(s), but the pitcher gets to play a card to try to throw the lead runner out.&#10;&#10;The batting team only has two pawn, so when a pawn that's on base has to bat, it's replaced with a ghost runner.&#10;&#10;If a runner reaches home, the batting team scores a point (run).&#10;&#10;After three outs, the teams switch roles and repeat the process.&#10;&#10;The team with the higher score after three innings wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Legends of Gold players are seeking the wealth of a forgotten civilization in an the ancient temple. You and your fellow treasure hunters compete for the most treasure, entering from different corners of the large hexagonal map.&#10;&#10;To be victorious, you must make it out of the map with health remaining and the most victory points found on artifact, treasure and item cards. With a limited hand size, you'll need to balance Treasure and Artifacts with the item cards you'll need to get out alive. Navigate through the twisted corridors of the 65 hexagonal map tiles to get to the center where the most treasure lies. Each tile will either present a hazard or a trap sprung by an event card drafted by a player on their turn.&#10;&#10;After choosing an event card, players will have one free action per turn, choose to either gather treasure or item cards, heal or move through the map revealing new tiles. On every cave-in event the lowest numbered tile is removed from the map. To hasten your escape, you may wish to trade a health for a second action. If you're not fast enough to be the first one out, you'll find yourself racing to find an exit as the map begins to disintegrate at an accelerated rate.&#10;&#10;You may be close to making it out, but managing your health to prevent your elimination may slow you down as you stare down at a pit hazard with no rope item card, but then again, how far are the other treasure hunters? Are there any dangers in the upcoming event cards? Is there a week tile about to cave in on your path? Can you take the loss of health by entering the tile? Do you draw Item cards looking for a rope?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Then the 2nd best player in the trick gets to conquer a card etc.&#10;&#10;Besides classical trick-taking strategies one must consider what continent the battleground card belongs to (set collection), what actions are triggered when you conquer the card (e.g. change current trump), if you can complete a nuke (which functions as &ldquo;super trump&rdquo;), if there are industries, oil, rare earth minerals or support to research space or drone warfare (worth dominance points) and if there is a strong resistance (negative points). The card you play in the current trick will be a new battleground card for the upcoming trick which must also be factored in when choosing what card to play.&#10;&#10;The player with the most dominance points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gods of war - Robert E. Lee is a historical wargame, set in time of American Civil War and mid 19th century. &#10;You can play battles from Bull Run to Gettysburg but also from Solferino to Sedan.&#10;The game is part of a series called gods of war. The first was the Gods of War &ndash; Napoleon. The game concerned the Napoleonic wars and was published only in Polish. &#10;Another planned title is Gods of War &ndash; Togo, which will enable naval battles in the period from the Battle of Trafalgar to the Battle of Tsushima. &#10;Each game in the series has its patron, general or admiral who won many battles. In the case of General Lee, he became the patron of the game due to the fact that the project initially concerned only the American Civil War. The game was very well received, so we created its second edition, which allows you to play through various conflicts in the mid-19th century, from the Crimean War to the Franco-Prussian War.&#10;&#10;The main rulebook contains lists for the armies of the Union and the Confederacy. &#10;Successive armies and war theaters are issued with add-ons to the game. &#10;The first was the Rule Britannia which introduced two British armies &ndash; the main one and the colonial one. Their organization and armament concern the late 1850s and the first half of the 1860s, so they allow for the hypothetical participation of the British in the American Civil War, but also the 2nd Opium War, the Indian Mutiny, or even the expedition to Abyssinia.&#10;&#10;Play the role of the commander-in-chief of an entire army and you will play the battle from this perspective. The game is therefore designed to play the greatest battles of the era, such as Gettysburg, Sedan, or Solferino. Your main task will be to manage your generals. You can have an excellent battleplan, but if you order an offensive to a cautious general or defense, to very aggressive one &ndash; your plan may fail. Imagine Jackson instead of Ewell at Gettysburg and you will get the point. Poor commander won&rsquo;t be able to execute a sophisticated plan, but they may be good enough for a frontal assault or static defense. As a commander in chief you have to bear in mind all of this.&#10;&#10;The fog of war is also very important. We use a system of patrol markers, at least half of them are &ldquo;empty&rdquo; (just a patrol) half of them hide corps. Your enemy does not now which patrol marker is just a patrol or a corps. Only when two patrol markers or patrol and a unit close to certain distance, they are revealed. And that&rsquo;s how you again have to thing as a real commander in chief from mid 19th century. Is that hill in the middle a good spot for artillery? So is this enemy patrol marker just an empty marker or maybe his reserve artillery? You have to read terrain, and make a lot of guessing. Make a decisions without a full knowledge of your enemy positions. That&rsquo;s the real mid 19th century warfare!&#10;&#10;The game is scaled to easily play huge battles, so one infantry and cavalry stand is one brigade, one artillery stand is on brigade or battalion of artillery. Because of the focus of commanding many things like combat or movement are simplified. As a commander in chief you don&rsquo;t bother about tactics of regiments or individual brigades, but you will watch the performance of entire corps, and divisions.&#10;&#10;Recommended for 6mm.&#10;Publisher produce own range of miniatures.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One being has established himself as a scourge on all life, whose power is unrivaled across all the cosmos.&#10;&#10;Of course, we are talking about Thanos.&#10;&#10;In this third campaign expansion for Marvel Champions: The Card Game, you and your fellow heroes must challenge the forces of Thanos. This massive expansion contains a brand-new campaign featuring five thrilling scenarios pitting you against members of the zealous Black Order, including Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, and, of course, the Mad Titan himself. As with previous expansions, you can play each of these scenarios individually or as part of a larger campaign, and with a slew of new modular encounter sets, there will be ample opportunity to mix things up for all of your Marvel Champions content. Of course, a new wave of expansions means more heroes as well, and The Mad Titan&rsquo;s Shadow starts it off with the mighty champions Adam Warlock and Spectrum, both of whom come with fully pre-built and ready-to-play decks right out of the box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game ends when one player lays down five different wombats in front of him/her or the Draw Pile is exhausted, then players proceed to collect Poo.&#10;&#10;Each card depicts a wombat with a different fighting style. The number on a card indicates how many of that wombat is in the game &ndash; eighteen samurai wombats, for example, but only four boxer wombats. The number also indicates the amount of Poo that each type of wombat gives during scoring. Some cards have a special skill icon on the top left corner too, which only activates once (as you lay them down). It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many cards with icons you have in one set of wombats.&#10;&#10;The player with the most Poo wins.

However, you do risk penalties from the referee or the VAR.&#10;Tactical options: substitutions, using different bulls, counter, etc.&#10;&#10;In total, there are 28 different action cards in this game, which can make the difference in combination with the attack and defense power of the bulls themselves.&#10;&#10;As they say: the ball is round, the meadow is filled with holes, you never know how the ball rolls or how a cow catches a hare.

    "Description": "Classic F1 is a lap by lap reproduction of Formula One auto racing. The game comes with all 33 Formula One champs, as well as all the active drivers from 2019. Every year, car, and constructor for each driver is represented individually and normalized across the history of the sport so you can match, for example, Fangio, Stewart, Senna or Hamilton head-to-head in any car they drove during their careers. &#10;Additional drivers are also available by decade, including a pre-1950s set including such greats as Nuvolari, Rosemeyer and Wimille.&#10;&#10;Each driver card has ratings for speed &amp; tactics, qualifying, fastest laps, passing, defending, ability in the rain, accidents and potential mechanical issues, to name but a few. Speedy drivers who excel on fast tracks will do the same here, while tacticians will show their worth on hard to pass tracks like Monaco. Drivers prone to accidents will have more issues than others and cars prone to breaking down with mechanical issues will have difficulty finishing a race.&#10;&#10;Each of the tracks from 2019 are represented their own chart which will determine the events during the race based on a die roll. These results may require further checks to the track chart or examining one or more driver ratings for the track action over one or more laps. Tracks that favor a fast driver will do so, while tracks that test a car&rsquo;s endurance will have more mechanical checks. Each track has its own historic weather check. The ability to pass on the various tracks is represented as well; tracks like Hungaroring will have few passing opportunities, while Monza will have more chances. Some tracks also give the driver the option for a one or two stop pit strategy. No two tracks are alike and the Track Set 2 provides an additional 20 classic circuits including Bremgarten, Detroit, Mt. Tremblant and the daunting Nurburgring &quot;Nordschleife.&quot;&#10;&#10;Every aspect of F1 is here - driver, car &amp; circuit variety,  qualifying, the chaos of lap one, accidents, safety cars and breakdowns. Qualifying takes about a half hour to run; a race can be run in roughly an hour and a half. There is some basic math involved, as you do not move on a track but rather, calculate the number of &ldquo;spaces moved&rdquo; for each car/driver, based on the results of a die roll, cross-referenced against the specific race track used as well as the driver/car ratings. The positions after each turn represent a certain amount of time behind the leader and after a pre-determined number of laps have been completed the driver in the lead wins the race. The broad range of random and not-so-random results make no two races the same.&#10;&#10;There has never been as detailed a representation of the sport&rsquo;s history as this game offers.&#10;&#10;",

Then the fishing phase follows where you activate your boats and use the resources to catch fish and earn more victory points. After this, the purchase phase follows where you acquire boats to improve the deck and catch a greater number of fish.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the four decks have the same number of players or less and the winner is the one with the highest score among their ships of the same color and tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;El hermoso r&iacute;o tiwiimi alberga los m&aacute;s grandiosos peces y en sus orillas diversas tribus pesqueras que con sus barcos hechos artesanalmente se baten en una feroz competencia anual, por tanto, la tribu que atrapa m&aacute;s peces gana prestigio y honor, esta vez t&uacute; lideraras la expedici&oacute;n al r&iacute;o as&iacute; que prep&aacute;rate y gestiona lo mejor posible tus embarcaciones logrando  obtener la mayor cantidad de puntos posibles.",

Some planets along the border are more ideal than others, but even a barren rock can be mined for resources. You will lead either the Royal Expedition Force of the Wami Kingdom, or the 3rd Fleet of the Neupert Prefecture.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the opposing fleets engage over one of the contested planets, and players select a vessel to engage. As the more powerful ship prevails, the system will join the victors stellar empire. If the ships fight to a draw, as they skulk away to lick their wounds, the following battles become more important, as the victor of the next battle will be able to lay claim to each system where combat was unresolved.&#10;&#10;Once both players have exhausted their entire fleet, cooler heads will prevail and an armistice will be signed.&#10;&#10;While both stellar empires may have made territorial claims, only the empire with the more worthwhile conquest can justify the skirmish and be called the victor!&#10;&#10;",

The gallows await fair Jamie (or worse!) should you fail. Fulfill your destiny and win his heart, only then will victory be yours!&#10;&#10;Players select an Event scenario to fulfill.

The games live in the same universe, but they&rsquo;re totally different. For starters, one is a video game and one is a card game. Also, one is an 8-player party game about making funny characters and the other is a 2-player combat strategy card game.&#10;&#10;Champ&rsquo;d Up: Slam Down is a unique two-player card game where each player takes the role of a trainer battling champs against their opponent until only one player is left standing/sitting! Each turn you will recruit champs from your hand into the ring to fight your opponent&rsquo;s champs. Deplete your opponent&rsquo;s reserves and call them out to declare victory and win the game!&#10;&#10;To get a pack (you only need one), play an online game of Champ&rsquo;d Up in The Jackbox Party Pack 7. Create ridiculous champs and battle them for supremacy. But draw with care because these champs are going to make their way into the physical world! After your game, you can purchase a pack of Champ&rsquo;d Up: Slam Down cards with the characters you created in Champ&rsquo;d Up. It will be custom printed and delivered right to your door. When you receive your cards, grab a friend and play this simple but exciting take on a 1-on-1 collectable card game. Combine decks and trade cards with others for even more ridiculous mayhem.&#10;&#10;Players will take turns until a player wins the game. The player who is taking a turn is referred to as the &ldquo;active player.&rdquo; At the very start of their turn, the active player gets 3 energy. On the active player's turn, they can use energy to execute a variety of actions: Recruit, Hype, Fight, use Special abilities, and Call out their Opponent. Slam Down's custom cards means a diverse variety of cards can be printed from playing Champ'd Up (in the Jackbox Party Pack 7) repeat times. Fighting is how players remove opposing champs from the ring. If the active player has a champ in the ready position and their opponent has no players in the ring, the active player can call them out. If the active player calls out an opponent with no champs in their reserve, the game ends and they win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Turns are split into two phases, a day phase and a night phase, in which different kinds of animals can attack, depending on their natural habits. You can try to block attacks against you, and you will try to increase the number of resource cards on the table to be able to add more cards to your layout. The goal is to reduce your opponent(s) Alpha animal to 0 life points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hegemon: A Wargaming Campaign in Ancient Greece is set circa 340BCE and pits Macedon against Persia with Greece as the battlefield. &#10;It is specifically designed for DBA 3.0 but is likely to be easily adapted to other sets of rules which cater for battles of around ten to 20 units.&#10;&#10;The campaign features a point to point map of Greece. Each turn represents a year and consists of a winter administration phase and two campaign seasons. &#10;Campaigns are likely to last three to five years (although a spectacular failure could see a campaign concluded in a single year) and likely to feature an average of three battles per year.&#10;&#10;During winter players spend their budget to bribe/persuade Greek city states in a variety of ways to make them amenable to a player's plans and to buy new elements to reinforce armies in the following year. &#10;During each of the two campaign seasons players move their army or armies on the map and invade hostile Greek states, the armies of which are played by the opposing player.&#10;&#10;The winner of the campaign will be the player who allies the greatest number of Greek states, or at least renders them neutral, by the time either Macedon or Persia cannot field an army sufficiently strong to continue.&#10;&#10;Although written with this specific hypothetical campaign as its basis, the campaign mechanisms are portable to other eras and armies, with the requirement only that the player create an appropriate point to point map of the area of operations. The article includes half a dozen ways in which to vary the original campaign and brief notes suggesting other historical conflicts of the classical period which might be simulated.&#10;&#10;The article is fourteen pages long and incorporates a campaign map and a budget tracking graphic.&#10;&#10;Finally it also presents a very simple methodology for resolving battles in a DBA style using any flat surface and 30 or so dice of different colours. This will allow the player to experiment with the campaign framework without committing himself to six to twelve DBA battles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the game, you get 144 cards, split into 2 decks of Chances (really good scoring chances), and Half-Chances (long shot scoring chances). Teams are rated simply for goals scored and goals allowed, home and away. Each team is rated further for who scores the team's goals when a goal is scored.&#10;&#10;Depending on the goals scored rating of the team and the goals allowed rating of the opponent, each team will get a certain number of possible chances per game. The trick is that not all those chances will come up in a game and, despite having more possible total chances in a match than the opposition, a streak of bad luck could lead to the big upset. Players roll two six sided dice, one to see if anything happens in that period of time (1 out of six times you get a Chance, 1 out of six you get a Half Chance, 4 out of six you get nothing ).  You roll each half of the match until you run out of possible chances.&#10;&#10;Example: one team has 7 chances, the other team has 3. There will be a total of 10 dice rolls to make up a single half of play. If you roll a 5 or 6, flip a FAC and a further roll of the dice will happen to determine the outcome.&#10;&#10;The Chance and Half-Chance cards have descriptive play calls on them so you really get the feel of watching the highlights reel of a match.

    "Description": "Manila, on the Philippine island of Luzon, was known throughout the world as &quot;The Pearl of the Orient&quot; for its lush gardens, modern buildings, and vibrant nightlife. It was also a strategically critical naval base, featuring the largest deep-water port in the Pacific. With the fall of the Philippines in 1942, the Japanese turned Manila into an enormous supply depot serving as a hub from which supplies could be shipped to bases across the Pacific, all the while ruling the Philippines with an iron fist. After more than two years of brutal Japanese occupation, General Douglas MacArthur &quot;returned&quot; to the Philippines in October 1944 at Leyte Gulf. In January 1945, the Americans invaded Luzon. They reached the outskirts of Manila in the first week of February and prepared to assault the city. The Japanese commander of Manila, Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi, had no grand plan for victory; just a fight to the death, taking as many American lives as possible.&#10;&#10;Sword and Fire: Manila is a Historical Advanced Squad Leader (HASL) module covering the month-long American effort to wrest control of &quot;The Pearl&quot; from the Japanese. Arrayed against the attackers was a mixture of veteran Japanese Marine and Army units and inexperienced Naval units composed of sailors, aircraft crewmen, and conscripted laborers with little or no formal ground combat training or experience. They were well-equipped with numerous machine guns as well as anti-aircraft guns ranging from 12.7mm to 120mm.
