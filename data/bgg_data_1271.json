    "Description": "The original Fleet Admiral was designed in the mid-1980&rsquo;s by Jack Greene while running Quarterdeck Games, a small part-time vanity press producing cardboard and paper war-games. The game is a highly-sought after collector's item on ebay; commanding top dollar. Fast-forward to today, and Consim Press is collaborating with Jack Greene on an all-new game to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Battle of Jutland. This game will represent a major step forward in WWI naval warfare, along with high production value (without breaking the bank like the ebay collector's item).&#10;&#10;Jack Greene was approached three times between 1990 and 2010 on producing the game professionally with a full print run. Now it is to be published by Consim Press. It is occurring now because over the past two years, Jack had an epiphany in approaching the game design. This is an example where historical research led Jack to eliminate player actions that hampered play and to change various values in the ship roster sheets and combat tables (used for resolving combat) to better reflect this deeper understanding of naval combat between Great Britain and Germany in the 1914-16 period.&#10;&#10;This game project has roots going back to the mid-80&rsquo;s with Quarterdeck Games publishing about 135 amateur production FLEET ADMIRAL games (1987) and would result in the spin-offs of TSUSHIMA (S&amp;T #130 &ndash; 1989) &amp; TOGO: Dawn of the Dreadnoughts (2018).&#10;&#10;Heavily modified since these earlier games, JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral results in a tight view of naval combat between the British and German fleets in 1914-1916. It represents years of research and years of playtesting. This is truly a simulation, and not a &ldquo;game&rdquo;, yet remains very PLAYABLE. Players may make this simulation as complex and accurate as they wish, or, alternatively, they can be playing a large action in just a couple of turns of watching the game being played. The 18 scenarios allow players to spend 30 minutes to many hours of play. The large fleet actions are best played with several players on both sides.&#10;&#10;JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral is the ultimate battleship simulation. This game has consumed hundreds of hours of design effort spread over years; and decades of research and study. JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral was conceived as a game that allows for realistic yet playable surface combat in the Battle of Jutland era. The concept was to design a big game that would give one the sense of the grandeur and scope of the largest surface battle ever fought on this planet and yet not load one down with needless detail. Certain liberties and abstractions have been taken to achieve the overall design goal, but I believe you will find that any sacrifices in the name of playability have been the correct ones.&#10;&#10;One of the greatest arms races in history was a primary cause of war in August of 1914. Ships would see action in every corner of the world. It was a war fought by two of the most highly trained navies in history. The Officers and Sailors of these two fleets had worked for years at honing their skills to an unimaginable extent. Both would offer up surprises to the other in the course of the war. But it also must be placed in a context where the vast majority of sailors of both nations, when they came onboard a warship, would find them working with tools and equipment that were new to them, and new to the modern world of 1914. The turbine, the radio, the telephone, powerful long-range &ldquo;heater&rdquo; torpedoes &ndash; all equipment that had been recently invented and perfected and was not to be found back on the farm or often not in the part of the cities where many of these men grew up.&#10;&#10;But JUTLAND: Fleet Admiral does not stop there. Also included are a number of possible hypothetical actions, carefully researched for 1914/1915.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium-High&#10;Playing time: 30 minutes to many hours&#10;Solitaire Suitability: MEDIUM&#10;Players: 1-9&#10;Map Scale: 1000 Yards/hex&#10;Time Scale: 1 Turn = 6 minutes&#10;Unit Scale: Individual counters for light cruisers &amp; larger, submarines, aircraft &amp; Zeppelins.

Each player chooses one card, and if it matches an item on their menu, they add it to their plate. If it doesn&rsquo;t match, they turn it face down and play moves to the next person. Each food item is represented on one card, with the exception of entrees, which are split up onto two cards. Players will need to find both halves in order to complete their meal.&#10;&#10;While each menu requires certain foods, drinks and desserts are not menu-specific, so a player may take any they find. If on a later turn they find another drink or dessert, their turn simply ends.&#10;&#10;The only item found on each menu is peas, and there are two cards in the game which state &ldquo;Please Pass the Peas&rdquo;. If a player finds one, they are allowed to take peas from another player who has them on their plate. If no player has peas, they may hold the card until either they find peas, or an opponent does. Once a &ldquo;please Pass the Peas&rdquo; card is used, it is removed from play. The first player to successfully fill their plate with all required menu items wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tank Board Game is a board game of armored battles of WW2. Its central focus is armor with minimal infantry rules. The attacking player tries to capture 3 of the defender&rsquo;s 4 towns by game turn 15, while the defender tries to keep 2 of his towns.&#10;&#10;Players move their tanks on a square grid gameboard trying to get a clear shot at the thinner side or rear armor plate of the enemy tank. Players can also move their tanks to higher-level positions and shoot down onto the enemy tank&rsquo;s thinner top. When a shot is taken, the tank's ability to destroy the other tank depends on its gun's penetration at target range, the thickness of the armor plate hit (turret/hull: front, side, rear, or top), and the angle the shell hits (level shot or falling shot &amp; full-face or quarter hit). Shot resolution is simplified using 3 randomly drawn chits (hit/miss, hit location, and critical hit) and then a quick table to find the effective armor vs. the gun&rsquo;s penetration. Armor plate thickness and gun penetration are all historical based.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Starter Rules&rdquo; include only tank vs tank direct-fire combat. The &ldquo;Advanced Rules&rdquo; cover tank hunters, armored cars, self-propelled guns, armored personnel carriers, towed guns and aircraft. They cover indirect fire, rockets, and close infantry combat. In addition, they cover mechanical reliability, smoke, mines, demolitions, pontoon bridges, airborne, weather, and an optional concealment rule.&#10;&#10;A total of 24 scenarios are provided: eight &ldquo;Starter&rdquo; scenarios and 16 historical &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; scenarios. The starter scenarios include common favorites: M-4 vs Panther, T34 vs Panther, and M-4 vs T-34 (Korea). The historical scenarios start with the invasion of Poland with an optional armored train, and end with &ldquo;Into Germany&rdquo; putting armored goliaths against each other. Scenarios are designed to provide near-balanced fun games featuring 30-40 tanks and supporting units of the period, with the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the campaign in which the scenario took place. Two gameboards (Northern Europe and North Africa), 295 units of 163 types, as well as markers and chits are provided.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Along the road between KOTO-RI and HAGARU-RI, KOREA, 29 November 1950: As the head of Task Force Drysdale fought its way through to Hagaru-ri, a miscellaneous assortment of British and American soldiers found themselves cut off, stranded in Hell Fire Valley for the night. As Marine air and artillery support tapered off at dusk, the remnants of the convoy now consisted of two large perimeters and three splinter groups, stretching over a distance of 1,200 yards. In the containment were 52 British Marines from the 41st Independent Commando, 190 men from Company B, 31st Infantry Regiment, and about 150 Marine service troops. There was no ammunition on hand for the 60mm mortars, and no heavy weapons. The Chinese took their time, probing and scouting before finally setting up one mortar on the right flank, and another on the left. Luckily, their fire wasn&rsquo;t accurate, as the British and American positions were hardly advantageous to the defense. Major J. N. McLaughlin and a veteran Marine MP, Warrant Officer Lloyd V. Dirst soon rose to the occasion, the former gathering the men in the northern group into a tight defensive perimeter and the latter striding about, smoking his pipe, and barking out orders. Later in the night the valiant MP was hit by a mortar round, suffering a serious head wound. Twice the men led by Major McLaughlin drove the Chinese from their mortar positions, only to have them return. By 0200 Hours, no grenades remained and orders were issued to fix bayonets. At one point the major called for the enemy to surrender. In the brief lull that followed about 100 men of the southern perimeter managed to escape. As daybreak approached the Chinese withdrew to the hills, providing an opportunity to evacuate the wounded. Among them was Warrant Officer Dirst, who survived only to die of his wounds a year later.&#10;&#10;We heard what you wanted and here it is AND then some. Areyou ready for a completely new take on Toktong Pass? Winterized, new retro terrain, Then you are ready to get your mittens on and join your fellow Frozen Chosin Marines and prepare for the next enemy attack.&#10;&#10;You receive a brand new Winterized map, 10 scenarios that all play on the winterized map, in color format, plus BW 3-hole punch color special rules!&#10;&#10;&mdash;'description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Family members take turns getting up and selecting an album, studying the cover, and sliding the album out of the jacket to load onto the player. As the needle pops and crackles, the wonderful music enchants the room and seems to synchronize with the twinkle of the lights on the Christmas Tree. It is another Vinyl: Holiday!&#10;&#10;In Vinyl: Holiday, players will work towards building Christmas trees out of albums. Each album features a sub-genre (Classical, Traditional, and Contemporary), one of four decades (the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s), one of five spirits (Joy, Love, Peace, Hope, and Faith). These album trees are being built by the players to your left and right in the true holiday spirit. Some of the points you gain are entirely in your control with the matches you make with previously played albums. Other points come from the combined efforts of you and the players to your left and right. To further increase the scoring opportunities, each player can sacrifice their hand size to complete attributes printed on each album's gift tags. Vinyl: Holiday Edition will be a game that you will want to play all year round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Includes rotating pizza game board with built-in timer, four launchers and 32 ingredients.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;In the game Pizza Party Throwdown there are three different ways to play but each one consists of players using catapult-like launchers to toss their ingredients onto the spinning cardboard pizza before the pizza stops spinning. In most cases, whoever has the most of their toppings on the pizza wins. Different play modes include simply having to put all of your toppings on the pizza first, putting all of your toppings on only one half of the pizza first, or putting two different toppings onto two different quarter sections of the pizza first.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Space Opera&quot; is a game of galactic politics for 2 to 4 players.  Each player controls a different power bloc striving to come out on top of the new order.  Game play is character-driven and the exploits of a handful of a few, key citizens will determine the fate of the galaxy for the next several centuries.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to bring the majority of planetary governments under the control of your power bloc.  Your tools include recruitment, local elections, diplomacy, and the occasional coup d'&eacute;tat and assassination.&#10;&#10;Players take turns activating one of their bloc&rsquo;s citizens.  When activated, a citizen may take 2 different actions; draw a new planet, replace an unpopular government, draw or play opportunity cards, recruit a population or new citizen, and travel.&#10;&#10;Dice are rolled to determine the degree of success (if any) of each action.  The number of dice rolled depends on your citizen&rsquo;s requisite skill level.  Skills are guile, intelligence, negotiation, opportunity, rank, and wealth.&#10;&#10;You can push your luck by re-rolling some of the dice, but failure on a re-roll can lead to failure and injury.&#10;&#10;Certain dramatic events, such as an assassination or successful no-confidence vote, ratchet up the tension.  This is indicated by removing a clock token from a pool.&#10;&#10;Once the pool is empty the game ends and the power bloc that controls the most planetary governments wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The players lay out a simple obstacle course and use markers to mark their steps as they knock the bomb around.&#10;&#10;The game comes packed in a plastic round black bomb with a red fuse. Inside the bomb is a small bag containing six small coloured discs, one for each player, a standard die, and two small stars. The bomb is not perfectly round, it has a flat base on which it stands easily.&#10;&#10;After removing the contents, the bomb is re-assembled. Players build a simple obstacle course on a large enough flat surface like a table, using household objects that players navigate around. One of the stars is used for the goal. The other star can be put back into the bomb to add weight and a little eccentricity (or similar can be used such as a small coin).&#10;&#10;The six-sided die is used to count rounds. If nobody reaches the goal after six rounds, the bomb explodes, and the player closest to the goal wins.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to hit the bomb towards the goal, avoiding the obstacles as they go. The rules say to use an open hand, or the back of your hand, or a chopping hand, to strike the bomb, instead of flicking with your fingers. In this way, the gameplay is meant to resemble golf.&#10;&#10;After a hit, the player uses their marker disc to show where the bomb got to, and the next player retrieves the bomb to the start and does the same. Once all the players have all had one turn, the die is turned to show the second round. The starting player then puts the bomb on their marker and continues.&#10;&#10;If the bomb should go off the table, that player doesn't advance their marker and continues next turn in the same place.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player or players who reaches the goal in the shortest number of turns.&#10;&#10;The graphic design was by ASOBI.dept.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Migong is a two-player territory game played on the 126 brown spaces (cells) of the initially empty hexagonal board shown above.&#10;&#10;The two players are called Blue and Yellow. Each player has access to 63 cell-sized hexagonal pieces made of six equilateral triangles each. Each player's set of pieces includes all combinations of at least one triangle of their color and at most five triangles of the opponent's color. Pieces have a fixed orientation and are never rotated or flipped during play. Any pattern of triangles that would result from rotating or flipping a piece is represented by another piece.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA wedge is one of the six triangular portions of a piece.&#10;&#10;A group is a wedge along with all other wedges one could reach from it through a series of steps between like-colored wedges sharing an edge with one another. Thus, all wedges in a group are the same color, and a group may include wedges from different pieces.&#10;&#10;A group's extent is the number of pieces that contribute wedges to it.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlue plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, place a piece from your set on an empty cell. Wedges from different pieces sharing an edge must be the same color. Likewise, a wedge must be the same color as any board edge sharing an edge with it, including the cell-like border in the center.&#10;&#10;If you have no moves available, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. Your score is the biggest group extent in which you have the greater number of groups. If there is no such size, your score is zero. If both players are tied at zero points, whoever made the last move loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means Yellow will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;The island is lousy with Nips&rdquo; &ndash;February 27th Message from the US Alamo Scouts to General Walter Krueger that more Japanese were on Los Negros island than reported.&#10;&#10;Before fleeing Corregidor, General Douglas MacArthur pledged to return to the Philippines. It was first necessary to retake New Guinea and at least neutralize the Japanese fortified base at Rabaul. Taking the island of Los Negros and its airbase at Momote would cut off Rabaul&rsquo;s ability to received supplies from Japan or elsewhere, and allow the US-led forces to advance for an offensive to retake the Philippines. US Intelligence thought the island was only held by a small Japanese garrison made up mostly of ground crewmen and laborers. Instead, the island was held by a Japanese army garrison composed of many veteran troops whose numbers nearly exceeded those of the US force tasked with taking the island. What ensued was a protracted and violent fight. Perhaps you can do as well or better?&#10;&#10;Each copy of Black Hell is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch map sheets&#10;&bull;    110 double-sided un-mounted counters&#10;&bull;    7 pages of charts and tables&#10;&bull;    9 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Players will also need a standard deck of cards and one D6, one ten sided die (D10, treat a die roll of 0 as ten and not zero), to play the game.  Units are mostly companies, a turn represents 1 day of time, and a map hex is one third of a mile across.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "With the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, the tension between the Northern and Southern States boiled over into outright hostility. Birthed in the South, the Confederacy fought to maintain its independency whilst Northern troops headed south in a bid to preserve the union. Four years of hellish fighting ensued, consuming the nation. It was a war the likes of which the Americas had not seen before, and would never again.&#10;&#10;It is one of the most studied military conflicts in history, with over 237 named battles in addition to innumerable minor actions and skirmishes. Tactically, battles were still largely linear - regiments frequently fired all their ammunition only to be relieved by a second wave of troops passing through the line. However, the technology of war had become all the more destructive, and casualty rates were atrocious, leading to some historians citing the warfare of the American Civil War to be a precursor to that of the 1st World War over 50 years later.&#10;&#10;The Epic Battles system allows for gamers to refight these battles on a huge scale.  The game is based on the familiar award-winning Black Powder rules system, with a few period-flavour tweaks to cement the battles in the ideologies of American Civil War doctrines.&#10;&#10;This box set contains no less than 2400 men. Each of the two armies are presented on colour-coded plastic sprues; the push-fit pieces are extremely easy to assemble - enabling you to quickly get to the business of gaming this fascinating era of history on the epic scale it deserves. You&rsquo;ll also find some MDF scenery to lend your battles extra authenticity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A good memory helps to sort everything and find pairs.&#10;&#10;The youngest forest pro starts and takes the top search card and looks at it. The task is now to find the matching forest card. The forest card has the search card printed small as the solution. So you have a check if you are right. You now go with the search card to one of the forest pieces. Lift up the forest piece and look underneath to see if the matching card is underneath. If the forest cards are still hidden under the forest piece, you may uncover them- They remain face up underneath. If you find the matching card, you get to keep it. The forest card is now placed in front of you. If you have six different forest cards, you can use them to lay a tree. If you don't find the matching card in a passage to the forest piece, it's the next player's turn. The search card goes back face up next to the search card pile. The next player moves to the next pile with Klaus the mouse. The game ends when 3 trees can be formed. The player who has the most search cards in front of him - that is, who has successfully found the most pairs - wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Sadly, he died of COVID-19 himself before the world realized he was sounding the alarm of an impending pandemic.&#10;&#10;&#10;In the card game Doctor Li, the corona virus is spreading at a threatening pace all over the world. Two to five players do everything they can to keep the curve of their land flat with good preparations and thus avoid a high death toll.&#10;&#10;&#10;To do this, they collect sufficient hospital capacity, effective leadership and social distance. But beware, while there are some benefits to be gained from a creative and benevolent population, there are also numerous aggravating circumstances lurking. Hoarding behavior and a new wave are never far away, while government leaders of all kinds are looking for ways to deal with this crisis.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 4 category cards in his hand. The player with a date of birth closest to November 17 (when the first case of Corona was discovered) gets to start.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game&#10; The last round of the game is played when 1 player has completed all three categories. All other players may then play 1 more turn.&#10;&#10;A player can discard a category when he has at least 3 unique cards of 1 specific category that the player can put down in 1 turn. This can be a category of 3 or 4 unique cards. The missing unique card in a category of 3 cannot be added later in the game.&#10;&#10;After the last round is played, the points are counted:&#10;&#10;     1 point for each 3-card category discarded,&#10;     2 points for each category of 4 cards discarded&#10;     1 bonus point for the player who is the first to complete all three categories. &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins. If there is a tie, the player who finished first wins.&#10;&#10;How does a round go&#10; 1. The player takes the top card from the category pile or the top card from the category discard pile and takes it into his / her hand without showing the others the card.&#10;&#10;2. The player then takes the top card from the action card pile and places it face up on the discard pile, visible to all players.&#10;&#10;     If the card has a logo in the top left corner, the player picks up the card in his / her hand and may play during this or subsequent turns.&#10;     If the card is an 'aggravating circumstance' or 'a boost', the consequences will apply immediately and only to the player who turned the card.&#10;     If the card is a &quot;hamster&quot; card or &quot;a new wave&quot;, the card applies to all players and all players must react immediately so as not to be affected by the card (see chart types overview). &#10;&#10;&#10;3. A player now has the chance to play the remaining cards from his / her hand, or to discard categories.&#10;When the player tries to discard a category, any other player can now play a 'Trump' card that forces the active player to discard any card of the hand played and take the remaining cards back into hand. Unless the active player can supplement the category with other cards from his / her hand OR plays another 'Trump' card that destroys the previous card.&#10;&#10;4. If there are no more players who wish to play additional 'Trump' cards and the category is still complete, then the category is now considered 'discarded' and cannot be removed for the remainder of the game unless there is an 'I don't think so' card is played. The next player can now start his / her turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Posies is a strategic board game where players compete to remove colored pieces from a hexagonal grid, balancing clever positioning with foresight to maximize their score. Players take turns eliminating pairs of posies, either adjacent or across a line, while carefully managing group formations. With each color worth different point values, players must weigh immediate gains against long-term scoring potential. The game ends when moves are no longer possible, challenging players to outwit their opponents through spatial reasoning and tactical removals.&#10;&#10;Materials&#10;- A hex board with 51 vertices&#10;- 54 pieces (posies) in 3 colors (pink, purple, green)&#10;&#10;Object&#10;Score the most points by strategically removing posies.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Players take turns randomly placing three posies of different colors, one per vertex, until the board is filled. Three posies remain unused (for a variant).&#10;&#10;Definitions&#10;Group: Adjacent posies. A single posy is also considered a group.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;1. Choose a starting player. Turns alternate.&#10;2. On your turn, perform one of these actions:&#10;   a) Remove 2 non-adjacent posies of the same color separated by a straight line of adjacent posies.&#10;   b) Remove 2 adjacent posies. If this splits a group:&#10;      - The moving player keeps the smallest resulting group.&#10;      - If smallest groups are equal, the moving player chooses which to keep.&#10;3. The game ends when a player cannot make a move.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;- Pink posies: 1 point each&#10;- Purple posies: 2 points each&#10;- Green posies: 3 points each&#10;Highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;Variants&#10;1. Most posies wins (regardless of color).&#10;2. Hidden color bonus:&#10;   - Before setup, place one posy of each color in a bag.&#10;   - Players draw one hidden posy each.&#10;   - At game end, reveal hidden posies.&#10;   - Score: (Total of revealed color x 3) + (Other colors)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

One player is &quot;Lange Frans&quot; (a Dutch rapper and TV presenter who believes in conspiracy theories) and tries to prevent the other players from achieving group immunity. The other players are common people who try to get everyone vaccinated at least once to achieve group immunity. There is also a game master who controls the flow of the game. The players together decide who will be &quot;Jaap van Dissel&quot; (the Dutch equivalent of Anthony Fauci), whose vote breaks ties.&#10;&#10;Each round of the game has three phases: the conspiracy, the surge and the vaccination. In the conspiracy phase, the common people are anesthetized (have their eyes closed) and Lange Frans secretly guesses who will get the vaccine this round.&#10;During the surge, everyone wakes up and rolls a special die to determine how to deal with this, which may help or hinder the player. In the vaccination phase, the group discusses and votes who should be vaccinated (gets a vaccination card), keeping in mind that three vaccinations for one person constitutes an overdose. If Lange Frans guessed right, the vaccin is not given but destroyed!&#10;&#10;In total there are 12 vaccinations available. There is also an untested Russian vaccine. If this is used on a common person, all people lose all their vaccines, but if Lange Frans is vaccinated with it, he loses the game. He also looses if he gets an overdose. Lange Frans wins when the people cannot be vaccinated in time anymore.&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Er heerst een pandemie!

Special cards with QR codes were created to be used with smart devices in addition to the standard cards.

The inventions come in the form of a card, and on the back of each is one piece of Tesla&rsquo;s infamous coil. This was one of his most significant inventions. Each player attempts to recreate the Tesla coil by assembling the cards like pieces of a puzzle. The player who first puts together the coil is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is interactive, and educational as each player tests their knowledge of Tesla&rsquo;s many inventions. The game also challenges players to think on the spot, as they make strategic decisions to not only move forward but to collect valuable invention cards.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

But watch out, any patients left in the city who have not been tended to, neglect in value and the player(s) who picked up the healthiest patients that round gain fatality tokens, if the worst happens to the patients! This expansion also includes a helicopter miniature (used to pickup patients from anywhere in the city grid for whoever is the first player that round) in the kickstarter edition.&#10;&#10;The Maternity Expansion&#10;This expansion includes normal sized pink mother dice and smaller pink baby dice! This expansion also increases interaction by making players compete for objective cards set by the &quot;city&quot; to ensure a good amount of mother and baby dice are discharged (with often other colour combinations) by the end of the game. This also includes a new spatial element to the game in which mothers only neglect when untreated and in a ward with other dice. Players also roll the birthing die to see whether they receive single or twin babies!&#10;&#10;The Improvements expansion&#10;This expansion allows for almost unlimited customisation! Players will be given a free to visit worker placement board where they can pick up room improvements specific to a colour of their choice. This expansion vastly increases the crunchiness of the game and is for players who have played the original game &quot;wanting more&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Four scenarios center on the SS &ldquo;Death&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; Division and are designed to shatter illusions about that formation&rsquo;s &ldquo;elite&rdquo; status.&#10;&#10;In addition to boards and counters from Broken Axis, most scenarios require components from one or more of Kursk: South Flank, Fire in the Steppe and Armata Romana.&#10;&#10;The booklet takes its name from its feature article on the famous Grossdeutschland Division and the included set of 64 die-cut counters portraying its lower level units in the division&rsquo;s color scheme. The counters aren&rsquo;t actually used in any of the booklet&rsquo;s scenarios. They are provided for the numerous Broken Axis scenarios in which the Grossdeutschland fought. Other articles in the booklet discuss the Romanian Royal Army and Soviet armored fighting vehicles employed in the Romanian campaign.&#10;&#10;Note: This booklet should not be confused with Panzer Lion: Grossdeutschland 1944, a long out-of-print Panzer Grenadier supplement that portrayed the division&rsquo;s actions in Romania and was superseded by Broken Axis.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to track down the infamous mole that Big Plastic &mdash; an evil consortium of plastic-toy manufacturers &mdash; have placed within Santa's organization by solving puzzles, hunting down clues, and engaging in some lateral thinking.&#10;&#10;The game comes in the form of a Christmas card that could be sent to friends or relatives with a cheery holiday message, which contains a link to a web app (written in simple JavaScript to be compatible with any smartphone, tablet, or PC) that mediates the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players ante each round for a number match card trying to match the six numbers on their lottery card to win the pot. Special instruction cards are thrown in to change things up when drawn. When a player or players complete their lottery card, all players that matched at least three of their six numbers get a trivia challenge card to try to win bonus cash. Those successful at the trivia challenge get the option do double their bonus winnings using the &quot;match deck&quot; paying for cards up to a certain amount trying to match their bonus number.&#10;&#10;",

Through the fog laying over the bay you see a shape moving, you take it as nothing, seeing things from a late watch. You take a swig of coffee from your canteen to clear your head. Suddenly you see the shape move out of the fog. A great lumbering beast low in the water, black smoke billowing from its smokestack, flying the flag of the Confederacy. You sound the alarm, and watch as this beast begins to make its way towards your ship. You hear your shipmates start to bark orders, and the guns open up. &#10;FDOOM! FDOOM! FDOOM! The cannonballs fly through the air at an incredible speed, &#10;CLANG! CLANG! You stare in horror as the shots bounce off the shape, as if it were made of iron! Suddenly your ship lurches underneath you, throwing you to the deck. You regain your footing and see the nose of the beast buried in the hull of your ship. It reverses its engines and slowly pulls itself out opening the hole to the sea.&#10;&#10;In Salt &amp; Iron you can reenact famous naval battles from the American Civil War right on your tabletop! &#10;These fast play rules are great for playing out any size battles in the matter of a couple hours.&#10; These can be casual games amongst friends or historical scenarios to see if history can be rewritten. &#10;What would have happened had Virginia destroyed Monitor, or if Monitor had even failed to arrive?&#10;&#10;Every Civil War historian is very familiar with the great commanders such as David Farragut, Samuel Francis Du Pont, Franklin Buchanan, and Raphael Semmes. &#10;With Salt &amp; Iron, you can put yourself on the deck with them commanding some of their famous ships, along with many others. &#10;There are many ships represented in Salt &amp; Iron, plenty to take action in almost any scenario one can think up.&#10;&#10;Now is the time Captain, prepare your fleet and lead daring actions against the enemy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
