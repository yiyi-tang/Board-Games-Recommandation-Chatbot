    "Description": "Pawikan Patrol is an action-selection, light deduction strategy game set in a coastal community where players send Characters to the Beach to find the location of Pawikan (sea turtles) and their nests, while keeping the Poacher away from them. Along the way, players must also clean up Trash and make sure that the natural Predator of the sea turtles is kept safe from harm.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they will choose a Character card from their hand and move it to one of the five face-down Beach cards on the Beach; in response, the Poacher card will also move to a new Beach card based on the number of arrows indicated on the Character. After moving, Beach cards in the same column as your Character and the Poacher are turned face-up at the same time: if they have the matching icon on the Beach card, they are collected; cards collected by Characters are put into their player's collection area; meanwhile, cards collected by the Poacher are discarded. If they do not have the matching icon, the cards are returned face-down.&#10;&#10;Characters have special abilities that allow the player to gather information from the Beach or the Beach Deck, manipulate the position of cards in different zones, or negate the Poacher's ability to collect cards before you do. Players must be careful with their choice of Character to send on any particular turn, because once they move to the Beach, they have to wait they only have one Character in hand to regain the use of all their other Characters; timing their movement can be very important.&#10;&#10;The player with the most number of points at the end of the game wins and is declared the Pawikan Patrol Leader; however, if they are they are careless enough to allow the Poacher to take away a certain number of turtles or eggs, ALL players can lose the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now, three doors and a rampaging Minotaur stand between you and the escape tunnel at the center of the maze.&#10;&#10;Your goal as the player is to find and discard all three door cards from the deck before you discard three Minotaur cards.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you'll choose to uncover either the left or right side of the next card in the deck, and the side you reveal will have a symbol that tells you whether you'll need to turn the card you moved before placing it back in the deck. Then choose one of two possible locations to place the card back in the deck, and repeat with the next card until you either escape...or fall to the Minotaur.&#10;&#10;With convenient in-hand play, simple but deep deck management, dynamically scaling difficulty, three game modes to try, and easy pausing, this is a deathtrap you'll never want to leave home without!&#10;&#10;This game was developed as an entry in the 2019 9 Card Game Print and Play Design Contest, where it won several awards, including:&#10;&#10;     #2 Best Cards-Only Game&#10;     #3 Most Innovative Mechanism&#10;     #7 Best Solitaire Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Originally conceived as a set of &ldquo;large scale skirmish&rdquo; rules for the Indian Mutiny, MD&amp;E is easily adapted for other theatres and periods. These rules will easily manage skirmishes and battles between European and any native forces. The rules will even work if you want to pit a colonial German force against the French Foreign Legion, or for that matter, the British in South Africa against the Boers.&#10;&#10;For the most part, the disparity in weapon technology offsets the fact that the Europeans are often heavily outnumbered, even though newer rifles meant superior range and firepower, in each theatre these new weapons were not universal. In fact, the British and other colonial powers often relied on locally raised allies, or levies, to do most of the fighting for them. The British had a habit of issuing local troops with weapons that were one or two developments behind their European counterparts. In far flung theatres, the replacement of seemingly obsolete weapons took some time.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are straightforward. All movement is randomized by using dice and you lose movement dice for bad terrain. It is easier to move and control units if there is a commander present. Firing and combat is based on the number of figures, plus or minus relevant factors. Damage either kills a figure or inflicts terror on the unit. Morale tests are triggered by extreme situations, or the gradual buildup of terror.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed to be quick, capable of handling battles from forty or fifty figures a side to several hundred. They have worked well on a standard home-sized 10 x 6 or a monstrous 45 x 6 and have been &ldquo;crash tested&rdquo; by over 100 wargamers from a dozen different countries.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Inspired by the legends of Gilgamesh and childhood adventure films like The Goonies, The Epic of Gil &amp; Ennis is a dice-rolling and management game for 1 or 2 players, playable in 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;In the game, 1 or 2 players, as Gil and Ennis will move through four phases on each turn: Hike, Pitch, Sleep, and Break. In the Hike phase, they will advance to a new campsite on the map, on their way to the final Mount Humbaba space. They will make camp during the Pitch phase, manipulating their dice as they prepare for the coming night. During the Sleep phase they decide whether to dream alone or together, and will then spend dice to overcome Dream cards, gaining Insight or giving in to Worry. In the morning, they will Break camp, depleting supplies and foraging for dice. All along, players will be managing their dice through character abilities and Insights, as they try to keep the mounting Worry level at bay. Players win if they reach the Mount Humbaba space of the map and meet the dice values of the final challenge.&#10;&#10;Played with a combination of dice and cards, the Epic of Gil &amp; Ennis was originally an entry into the 2019 9 Card Design Contest.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Odkrywcy kultur is a game of cultural discovery that takes you around the world in just 40 minutes!&#10;&#10;We all love to travel, explore exotic civilizations, and gain a greater understanding of the cultural heritage of others. But discovery isn&rsquo;t always easy, and there&rsquo;s always that chance that missteps might offend rather than open doors.&#10;&#10;Did your host in Japan reach for her samurai sword when you plunged your chopsticks into the rice bowl? Did the guys in an English pub take a swing at you after you gestured to the bartender asking for two beers?&#10;&#10;Odkrywcy kultur takes players to new and exciting places around the world while showing them how to behave to avoid confusion, conflicting signals, and even real danger. During the game, participants visit all continents and discover hundreds of unwritten rules of social behavior: how to gesture acceptance in India, what to avoid in Egypt during Ramadan, and how to successfully conduct business negotiations in Brazil.&#10;&#10;Odkrywcy kultur is a unique mix of a modern board game and a handbook on cross-cultural communications. As players race to pick up souvenirs across the globe, they must think tactically to plan their trip, quiz others on potential cultural faux pas, and quickly react to opponents&rsquo; moves. As with any game, a bit of luck always helps.&#10;&#10;When players correctly answer an opponent&rsquo;s question they win chips with souvenirs and can then travel to another country, opening a treasure chest of knowledge about the new region. The game&rsquo;s questions were designed and arranged to offer interesting and practical information about our &ldquo;global village&rdquo; during play.&#10;&#10;The rules of Odkrywcy kultur were designed by Karol Madaj, designer of 303 as well as Kolejka (Queue) and Lukasz M. Pogoda. The questions and answers in Odkrywcy kultur were drawn from the decades of travel experience and cultural exploration of Halina Grzymala-Moszczynska, PhD, professor of Jagiellonian University in Cracow, and Witold Sekudewicz, the game&rsquo;s author and managing director of The Link School of Foreign Languages and Intercultural Communications. Mr. Sekudewicz and Ms. Grzymala-Moszczynska worked closely with a panel of widely traveled experts from universities on five continents in creating the game.&#10;&#10;Odkrywcy kultur is a must for anyone with an interest in our multicultural world and a love of sharing fun and excitement with friends and family. It&rsquo;s a great pastime for both seasoned explorers and those who only dream about faraway places. Also, it is a storehouse of practical knowledge for any business traveler: Don&rsquo;t risk a blunder and failed deals because you misread the signals when you&rsquo;re away from home.&#10;&#10;Before you buy your plane, train, or boat tickets, learn how to sidestep unpleasant situations and awkward apologies and avoid offending your hosts. Yes, even a journey of 10,000 miles begins with a single step. Odkrywcy kultur is the step you&rsquo;ll want to take first.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Their short spears are light enough to even be thrown at the enemy, letting the Spearwives cut them down at range. But the real danger comes when they Charge. Their sharp spears, with the momentum of a running start, can pierce even the toughest armor. Adding a seasoned Spearwife Matriarch to the unit only enhances their maneuverability.&#10;&#10;The Spearwives Unit Box for A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Free Folk Commanders a new unit and unit attachment that they can bring to the battlefields of Westeros.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sabotage was designed and illegally distributed by a group of Danish resistance fighters during the German occupation of Denmark which lasted from 1940-45. It simulates an actual act of sabotage that took place against a transformer station at the Scandia Locomotive Factory in Randers on 6 July, 1943. Erik Hagen, a medical practitioner who was also active in the resistance underground, is said to have sold the game to his patients and donated the money to illegal activities and operations. He was shot and killed on 6 June, 1944, while returning from a sabotage mission against the Globus Factory in Glostrup.&#10;&#10;The game pits 1-2 saboteurs against 1-2 factory guards, and challenges the saboteurs to blow up as many machines and buildings as they can before they are either caught, killed, or manage to escape. The saboteurs will have to acquire the necessary equipment, such as crowbars, guns, and explosives, on the black market before entering the factory grounds and setting the charges. The factory guards, on the other hand, are trying to discover the saboteurs and raise the alarm. Once raised, the saboteurs only have a few turns to complete their operations and escape the factory grounds before the police arrives and arrests them.&#10;&#10;The game board and pieces are printed on a single sheet of paper which players are instructed to mount on cardboard and cut out. Movement is controlled by the throw of a single 6-sided die, as are the gun fights which may occur if the guards discover the saboteurs. Considering the relative simplicity of the game, the simulational approach of the design sometimes makes for complicated situations which are only partly covered by the accompanying rules sheet. This also means that there are no hard and fast criteria for winning or losing. Rather, the game presents itself as a training simulation meant to inspire further acts of sabotage against the German occupying force.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

We chatted about his backstory a bit and then worked on mechanics. Jason and Mike finished him up and wanted to share at PNP Arcade, since Twin Stars doesn't require shuffling.

Impacting initially in a compact spherical form, it unfolded to reveal its long legs and extending manipulator appendages, proving it could swiftly cross any terrain as it focused on urban centers. Deimos-9 has shown the capability of reaping vast amounts of energy in minutes and seems to prefer to prey on power plants, solar grids, and other high-energy locations. Its grappling manipulators and limbs are made of advanced Martian metals and polymers, being extremely durable despite a fragile appearance.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the box&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1871, the Treaty of Versailles was signed between France and the newly established German Empire, badly shaking the balance of power which had kept Europe relatively stable since Napoleon&rsquo;s defeat in 1815. France longed for revenge against Germany. So did Austria-Hungary; yet the weakening Ottoman Empire seemed a much easier target for recovering the honour which she had so recently lost to the ascendant Germans. But Russia, too, longed to see the subject peoples of the Balkans take refuge under her own wings; and every attempt by a European power to spread her influence into the Sick Man of Europe was watched with grave concern by all. Russia, with its huge army, was also being closely monitored by Britain in central Asia, where the latter wondered what schemes this eastern giant might have planned. Had Russia intentions towards Britain&rsquo;s treasure of India? And was this new German Empire friend or foe? Would she attempt the herculean task of building a large navy to rival Britain&rsquo;s? Ultimately, Germany would abandon the less expansionist and more diplomatic realpolitik of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and chose instead to follow the path of Bernhard von B&uuml;low&rsquo;s weltpolitik, a policy intended to establish the national honour of the German Empire across the globe. As von B&uuml;low said a quarter-century later, &ldquo;We wish to throw no one into the shade, but we demand our own place in the sun.&rdquo; This struggle for a place in the sun would ultimately lead to the catastrophe of World War One, drawing all five powers into its maelstrom and destroying three of them in the process.&#10;&#10;Weltpolitik portrays the rising tensions and dwindling war-fuse which burned among the European powers from 1871 until the time of the First World War. However, a world war is not necessarily your objective. Your goal is simple: outrank your rivals in national honour with or without the Great War breaking out. To do so, you must spread your influence into the four areas over which the European powers were quarreling during this time: the declining Ottoman Empire, central Asia, the Far East, and Africa. You must also build sizeable armies and navies in the event that war does break out. If you are leading in national honour, then this might be the right opportunity for you to initiate the catastrophic conflagration. But if your ambitious schemes isolate you diplomatically, you just might find yourself friendless when war begins, and subsequently witness the collapse of your empire. Perhaps you should play the honest broker, and try to prevent the Great War. Have you the wisdom of a Bismarck, or the incompetence of a Kaiser Wilhelm II?&#10;&#10;Weltpolitik is a card-driven game inspired by the award-winning two-player game Twilight Struggle, but playable with up to five players. Given the radically different settings of the two games, you will find familiar mechanics considerably transformed, as well as some completely new ones. Naturally, the events portrayed on the cards are very different: the German Fleet Acts, the Boer War, the Boxer Rebellion, the founding of the Indian National Congress and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand are all here, as well as many, many more. Players can even form alliances and host European Congresses to both lessen tensions and deal with matters they&rsquo;d very much like to avoid.&#10;&#10;Weltpolitik can be played in a variety of ways. Given that new players will have no familiarity with the cards, each Decade can be played as a One-Decade mini-game simply to learn about the cards available for that Decade (for novices, such a game might take a little more than an hour). Once players are comfortable with the cards for the first two Decades, they may want to try a two-Decade game consisting of Decades One and Two; and when Decade Three is mastered, a three Decade game, and so on. With experienced players of Weltpolitik, a full five-Decade campaign game can be anticipated to last from potentially three to three and a half hours. The five Decade game will last much longer for players who don&rsquo;t know the cards! Alternatively, players may play a multi-Decade game beginning in a Decade other than Decade One; and there are two shorter one-region scenarios available as well.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game Hobby Farmer is an attempt to share real-life hobby farm experiences through a board game that everyone can enjoy. The goal is to build a self-sufficient hobby farm, by being the first player to earn the winning number of points by pairing livestock with crops to create sustainable habitats. 2-4 players, ages 6 and up.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the player rolls the die and moves the number of spaces indicated. Depending on where he/she lands, the player may purchase livestock animals--such as pigs, horses, or chickens--or food habitats (aka, 'crops')--such as apple orchards, pasture, or vegetable gardens. When an animal or crop is purchased, a tile is placed on the player's farmstead in one of the 16 allotted spaces. Depending on how the player places his/her tile, points will be awarded. For example, placing honeybees next to a flower garden will award 2 points. The first player to reach 7, 10, or 14 points (novice, medium, difficult gameplay) wins.&#10;&#10;Players earn currency in the game whenever someone lands on the &quot;Farmer's Market&quot; space. Cards are drawn from a special deck indicating which items are in demand at the Farmer's Market. Depending on which animals or crops the player has on his/her farmstead, he/she will be awarded currency accordingly. He/she can then use that currency to purchase more animals or crops to place on their farm.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Starting with nothing but your sugar shack and a good measure of determination, you must build your sugar mapling enterprise from the ground up. Exploring the forest and tapping the right kinds of trees will generate cash flow that you can use to upgrade your equipment and expand your operation. But beware, other settlers have similar ambitions and will try to beat you to the tap.&#10; To play, each player chooses a cabin site on the gameboard and places their cabin. They also place one tree tap on a tract of land that is adjacent to their cabin. On each turn, the player rolls a die and moves along a track. Depending on where they land, they may be able to purchase supplies or run into danger.&#10;&#10;Whenever any player lands on the Sugar Maple tile, all players participate in the syrup harvest as follows: First each player draws one tree card for every tap placed. The tree cards indicate how many gallons of syrup are collected. After all the tree cards are counted, players receive currency (gallons of syrup) that they can use to purchase more land and place more taps.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the first player to place all of his/her taps. In a 2-player game, this is 8 taps. In a 3-player game, 7 taps. In a 4-player, 6 taps.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arcane Guardian is a quick, fun solo dungeon crawler card game of tactics, scarce resource management, and luck. Ancient powers have risen and are threatening humanity once more. It is you, the Arcane Mage who must face them. You have to weaken them before they swarm the realm of the living. To do so, you have to confront all the terrors crawling deep below the surface. The goal of the game is simple: escape the dungeon. Will you live to see the daylight?&#10;&#10;Arcane Guardian is lightweight and highly enjoyable from the very first play with enough depth to keep you entertained. You control a mage who wanders in an enchanted dungeon, opens treasure chests, fights monsters and drinks magical potions. You have to defeat numerous elementals and undead. Try to save as much Mana as possible, for if you run out of it, you cannot even emit light from your staff and are left in the dark. Your options are limited, while the dangers are many. In Arcane Guardian, every decision matters!&#10;&#10;Arcane Guardian is a Print and Play card game. The deck contains 60 cards, and there are an additional 21 cards. One game takes about 10 minutes. The game is made up of steps that are to be carried out in a set order. In the beginning, you have three ways to go. You select a deck and interact with the upper card. If the chosen card was not revealed, then you must reveal it and instantly interact with it. You may collect the card or discard it into the discard pile. After an interaction&rsquo;s end, you have to reveal all cards that are unrevealed (face down) on top of a deck except on the one that you interacted with. If your health goes below 1, and you cannot heal than the game is over and you lose. You should always consider whether to fight an enemy and lose health, or cast spells and spend your mana. You may suffer several terrible curses that weaken you, but you can even their effects out with masks, or create powerful and interesting combinations of different positive and negative magical effects. Of course, luck has an impact on your gameplay, you have to roll a die when you open treasure chests and when you interact with traps.&#10;&#10;You play until you find an ending card among the bottom six cards of a deck. If you successfully interact with it, then you win the game and escape the dungeon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Diplomacy is over. The first artillery rounds are being fired on every front of the WWI. But the frontline combats are just the last piece of an intricate puzzle. As the Commander-in-Chief of one of the 7 European powers, Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Italy, your duty is to support your nations war effort by any means possible. Improve your technology in order to make your weapons more lethal than the enemy ones, orchestrate obscure plots in the shadow using your spies and keep your home front morale high, to avoid a sudden revolution that would throw your nation in turmoil.&#10;&#10;Let's war is a card game for 2 to 7 players. Each player must manage his card hand made of Conflict cards, collected from a common draw deck, and National cards drawn from his own deck. These National decks are different for each nation, making the game totally asymmetrical. To increase such an asymmetry, each player can rely on a Characters deck to pick his VIPs from. These VIPs (either generals, politicians or artists) can influence the game performance of that nation as long he or she is in charge. Conflict cards and National cards can be used to improve your own army both in defensive or offensive terms, or to activate Spies to move the war onto an undercover level. The goal of this kind of war is to reduce the Home Front value of an enemy nation, attempting to spread a revolution and destroy any civilian support.&#10;&#10;The game is able to reproduce the raging early stages of the war with bloody clashes that slowly turn into trench warfare. From time to time, as some offensive power difference arise, you will see furious offensives, quickly silenced to a new stall phase.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Ninja Pizza Party, each player has their own stack of pizza slice cards. Each round, customers equal to one less than the number of players (except in two-player) are randomly chosen and the players all go through their stack of pizza slices one at a time, either adding the slice to their pizza or discarding it. Once they run out of cards in their stack, they take the discard pile from the player to their right to use as their new stack of slices. When a player completes their pizza of six slices, they claim the customer of their choice. This continues until all of the customers have been claimed. Points are awarded based on how many slices each player's pizza has that match the customer's favorite topping.&#10;&#10;When building a pizza, the players must match at least one topping on the slice next to the spot where the new slice is going to go. For the sixth (and last) slice, the slice being added needs to match a topping on each of the pieces next to the open slot. Each slice of pizza has two toppings, except for special &quot;kitchen sink&quot; slices, that have all of the available toppings. These special slices are limited to one per pizza. If a player's pizza is completed but does not follow the rules, the player that did not claim a customer can score points for that other player's customer, using their incomplete pizza, provided said pizza DOES follow the placement rules.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player takes their current stack, discard pile, and pizza and combines them to form their new stack for the next round. Customers are randomized and selected again, and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;This continues until at least one player has 15 points, at which time the player with the most points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To do this, you must manage your actions well, so you can complete your goals before the others.&#10;&#10;In their turn, each player has action points, which can be spent writing cordels (spending inspiration), publishing them, buying cordels from other writers, completing goals or collecting new inspirations. Goals are the key to the game, as the victory points guaranteed by it make up the bulk of the final score. Among these objectives, there are 3 categories: the color standards of the cordels on the poles, the presence of players on the poles and the collection of cordels.&#10;&#10;The match ends when one of the players reaches a certain number of goals, then the points are scored for the completed goals and other smaller forms of the score.

    "Description": "The Democratic Republic of Korruptonia is in turmoil after the last president was suddenly removed from office (once again). The result of this was a dangerous instability, which swept the influence of the main parties in all regions of Korrupt&ocirc;nia, creating a fertile environment for a non-partisan outlet of the whole country. So to conserve the stewardsh... or rather, the Korruptonian democracy, the country's main political parties articulate an emergency electoral campaign in order to regain partisan prestige and elect a representative.&#10;&#10;In order to be able to elect its representative, the party must increase its influence in the regions of the country, through the presence of its candidate or the support of the media, personalities, smaller parties and companies. With the use of mechanics like area control, auction and hand and resource management, Korrupt&ocirc;nia is a strategic game of fantasy themed.&#10;&#10;There are five regions of Korrupt&ocirc;nia, and each one has different demographic characteristics in each game. All these regions begin with a high influence of the partisans and with almost no influence of the great political parties - each party only initiates with a minor influence in its original region. Each player will have five weeks (or five rounds) to reverse this scenario, gaining enough influence for his candidate to lead the polls at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To achieve this, players will have to manage well each of the phases of the rounds: the campaign phase and the political action phase. In each round, the position of the candidates in the polls will determine the order of the players, in descending order.&#10;&#10;In the campaign stage, players must decide whether to move their candidate and pay the costs (of money and speech, which are two of the three resources that the parties must administer) to campaign wherever they are, gaining influence in doing so .&#10;&#10;After that, in the political actions phase, each player must take one of the actions of the cards in his hand, eventually having to pay his costs (of money, speech and government positions, which are the three features of the game). These actions range from setting up campaign committees, influencing news media for or against candidates, and also hiring famous people for your campaign, joining smaller parties and attracting companies to fund the campaign (these last three actions require a auction with the other parties). After making an action, the player can exchange resources with the political market, which varies with each negotiation, and also use one of the political actions of the open cards on the table, paying extra costs for this. At the end of each round, the party influence in each region determines an update of the voting intentions of the candidates in the polls.&#10;&#10;At the end of five weeks, the party ahead in the polls will win the match.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Taquara-Castelo is a promotional postcard game developed by the collaborative studio Casa do Goblin (Brazil) for a series of collectible flyers of the Castelo das Pe&ccedil;as (Rio de Janeiro) event, in which both the playing area and the rules are contained in the space of the back of the flyer.&#10;&#10;In this game, players are drivers who must drive their vans, collecting and leaving passengers around the city, while trying to leave the passengers in Castelo (a neighborhood in the central zone of Rio de Janeiro) at the most opportune moment. For this, the vans must cross the track sections, respecting the correct hand of each of them, avoiding being blocked by the others. Managing the van's ability is important: the more crowded, the fewer stretches it can go through in a move. In the end, those who have collected and left a more varied number of passengers will receive a high amount of points, and whoever has more points will win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician, proved that intelligence can win wars by deciphering the German Enigma code during World War II. Likewise, in Alpha Charlie Tango, players have the challenge of uncovering their opponents' secret codes, deciphering each of their parts through a meticulous and strategic choice of which false messages to send, before they discover their code.&#10;&#10;There are five possible characters, but several combinations, and each time a player sends a three character message, each of the other players signals the presence of these characters in their code (if there are equal characters, only one character must be signaled, which the mission of figuring out your code even harder). In turn, a person may try to deduce a part of the code from another person, but if he makes a mistake, he should reveal a part of his own code. Whoever is the only one still has hidden parts of his own code!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Moscovis are a very friendly family of fly-spiders. However, all Moscovis have some peculiar and hereditary characteristics. The first is that they do not see the colors well, and they reverse the ability to identify each one a little. That would not be a big problem, were it not for another Moscovis trait: a serious food restriction. For Moscovis, eating flakes of certain colors can have serious consequences, from a bellyache to more serious things! That is, a Moscovis can never &quot;fly&quot; away from it's attention!&#10;&#10;In this way, each player is in the shoes of a member of this family in &quot;The Moscovis&quot;, trying to correctly identify the colors of the flies, in the order in which they are arranged, using the colors they have in mind (or better, in the hands)! The letters have the name of one color, but the color of the letter is different, and each needs to put the names of the colors in order according to the colors of the flies, as soon as possible. The difficulty is heightened by the fact that each set of cards has different combinations of colors and names.&#10;&#10;",

This is done by moving their pawns into the opponent's emperor space in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;During each turn, a player will choose a pawn to move to an adjacent open slot. Then they choose to either rotate a ring of the board, place a dragon cylinder to block an opponent or forfeit their secondary action, which removes the rotation tracker from the board. If the player chooses to rotate the ring that their pawn has entered or the center ring, they must mark which direction they rotated the ring by placing the rotation tracker on it. This blocks the next player from undoing the rotation that was just completed.&#10;&#10;Each player plans their movements, but find that the grounds beneath them are always shifting, forcing them to plan their movements even more carefully.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Zont! is a co-op storytelling game of adventure that fosters creative thinking and teamwork.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player chooses a role (Captain, Scientist, Explorer, Security, Diplomat or Engineer). Memory tiles that depict a color (Emotion) and a word are turned over and spread out in the center of the table. A Story Plot is chosen at random, this is the goal the team was trying to accomplish on their mission and indicates a specific word found on the Memory tiles.&#10;&#10;On their turn a Player reveals two Memory tiles. If two matching colors are found that Player begins a &quot;Complete Memory&quot; using the Emotion indicated by the color and the two different words on the tiles. Each other player then contributes by &quot;Adding To&quot; the memory from the viewpoint of their role on the team. After all players have had a chance to &quot;Add To&quot; the memory, the pair of tiles are placed on the Memory Track at a point determined by the team.&#10;&#10;After 8 Complete Memories (linked from Start of Story to End of Story) are found you will have pieced together your trip to Zont and have a unique story only your team could have had.&#10;&#10;Winning or Losing is optional. To Win the players must find and work the Story Plot term into the story and individual players are awarded points on their participation. But for younger or more casual play the journey itself is just as rewarding.&#10;&#10;We hope you had a wonderful time on Zont!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to be the first have 80 TSD in the bank.&#10;&#10;The basic trade for these banks is customer business. Each bank has three branches where they can look after different customers and try to cash in on their investments.&nbsp;You earn your costumers&rsquo; trust through persuasive bank advisors. If the trust is established you will fill your pockets with quick cash, but as soon as the trust is lost the costumers will flee and the money with them.&#10;&#10;To make sure the other banks won&rsquo;t do too well, there are plenty of action cards you can use to influence and manipulate the competition. Lawyers, for example, sue the most capable employees of the other banks, the black bloc destroys entire branches, and the critical shareholder worries the investors of your competitors. On the other hand, of course, one's own bank can also be improved by incidentally food speculation, attracting rating agencies or allowing brokers to work for you. With over 50 different cards and a total card number of 185 cards there are numerous options available to pave the path to the big money.&#10;&#10;The own pocket is represented in the game by a small cloth bag, so that the competition cannot see your fortune and nobody can be certain to win the game until the very end. Suspense until the big finale is guaranteed.&#10;&#10;The turn-based game is characterized by having a very high level of interaction between the players and which allows to have a great impact on the moves and opportunities of other players. With a duration of 90 to 180 minutes (depending on the number of players), there are enough opportunities to make up for any financial arrears. Each turn you hold, six action points can be used. You can split them up between buying new cards, playing the cards in your hand, and activating cards already placed. You control the markets and gameplay through your own behavior, so that no match is the same and different tactics can be profitable.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
