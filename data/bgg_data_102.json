    "Description": "Based on the popular videogame and designed by Uwe Rosenberg, players in Farmerama use action cards to sow and harvest crops (carrots, hay, oats, corn) to feed their livestock (sheep, pigs, cow, horse) and earn victory points. On each player's board, a rotating wheel indicates where and when actions can take place, and another central wheel that affects all players indicates what yields they can expect. These wheels change over time, creating constantly shifting situations that players must navigate.&#10;&#10;Buyers of the board game will also receive free resources to spend in the videogame.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Imperialism: Road to Domination approximately covers the period from the 15th to the 19th century. The players control superpowers and attempt to transform them into mighty empires. To accomplish this, they will not only have to look after the economic growth and try to gain social and civilization achievements, but also modernize and expand their fleet and land army. Because being at war is expensive, it is often wiser to resort to plots and lies. Sometimes, making empty promises at the negotiating tables is better than getting involved in a risky and exhausting war, which may empty the treasury and expose you to losing precious prestige. The players have to pay extra attention to the dissenters who, especially in the beginning of the game, have greater military power and will not hesitate to draw others into a religious war. Will you manage to create an enormous colonial empire, military European dominion, or a territorially small but economically strong country? The players&rsquo; choices, luck, and reactions of others will affect the struggle. Creating an empire requires good strategic sense and a flexible approach to changing military and economic situations. The players have to forge thoughtful alliances and avoid wars which they may not win.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to create the most powerful empire. To achieve this, the players will change the reigning rulers, brew plots, conspire, conquer minor countries and overseas lands which will increase the level of goods production in their empire. The players will have to expand their armies and fleet to confront other superpowers. The player with the most glory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Lang.&#10;&#10;In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of up to 20 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;The starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

This time, Princess Bubblegum and her NiceLands deck take on Lumpy Space Princess&rsquo;s totally rad dual-Landscape deck in a royal rumble.&#10;&#10;NiceLands Creatures are all about using the damage on them to make them better. Most Creatures are looking for a particular sweet spot of damage. Sometimes you will want to heal damage from your Creatures to get them there. But sometimes you might actually damage your own Creatures to get them to that sweet spot. This new deck not only brings a new Landscape to the mix, but a whole new style of play.&#10;&#10;Lumpy Space Princess&rsquo;s deck is a Useless Swamps and Blue Plains deck. This is the first time a Collector&rsquo;s Pack has featured something other than a mono-color deck. The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around discarding cards to power up your Creature abilities. Which is never a bad thing for the swampy side, as they thrive when they have built up a sizable discard pile.&#10;&#10;The Blue Plains side of the deck is themed around replacing Creatures you control. Many of the Creatures in this half of the deck get killer bonuses for replacing Creatures that were already in play. It complements the Useless Swamp desire for a large discard pile as well. Such synergy!&#10;&#10;",

The starting player (black) moves one of their pieces, moving it 1-3 squares depending on the number of markings on its starting location; a player can move a piece orthogonally in any direction, making 90&ordm; turns if they wish. A piece cannot move through other pieces, but if it ends its movement on an opponent's piece, that piece is captured and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;After the first movement, the player looks at the number of markings of the square where their piece landed, then they take the neutral mana bird from the side of the board and place it on an unoccupied square that has the same number of markings. The next player must move one of their pieces standing on a square that has the same number of markings as the square where the mana bird is located &mdash; moving that piece a number of squares equal to that number &mdash; then they'll move the mana bird in a similar manner based on where that piece lands.&#10;&#10;If the opponent places the mana bird on, say, a 2 square and you have no pieces on a 2, then you can either (a) move any of your pieces a number of squares equal to the markings on its starting location or (b) reintroduce one of your captured ronin on any unoccupied square of the game board.

If you want to jump out of the bidding, place your &quot;Mine!&quot; card on one of the bid cards available; the earlier you pass, the more choices you have. Whoever sticks in the bidding long enough wins the dino, then they decide whether to pay with snacks or gems, with no change if you overpay.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to have the most points at game's end. Each dino is worth 1-5 points on its own, with pairs and triplets being worth 3 and 6 points. That said, you can choose to discard an acquired dino if it's a duplicate in order to transform your &quot;Mine!&quot; card into a joker. Why would you want to do that? Because sequences of dinos are also worth points, with six in a row being worth 15 points, for example.&#10;&#10;If you make clever bids, occasionally pass at the right moment, and get the most valuable guests, you&rsquo;ll be crowned the ultimate prehistoric party animal!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stress Botics is a sci-fi adventure in which four easily-stressable robots (known as Beta Bots) are sent to an exoplanet by their corporation Cubebotics CORP&reg;, in order to mine its resources. Once those resources are extracted, the Beta Bots' task is to deliver them to the corporation's ships.&#10;&#10;It won't be a piece of cake. To start with, the exoplanet is unstable, so the Beta Bots will have to adapt to a constantly changing environment.  On top of that, each corporation ship requires different resources, and each payload delivery requires perfect timing &amp; alignment with the orbiting trajectory of the matching ship. And last, but not least, the rival corporation Cylindroids INC&reg; has sent its own bots to snatch resources and interfere with your bots.&#10;&#10;But do not fret! Beta Bots can count on Alpha Bot&rsquo;s help, a support robot with a (very) short-tempered AI. Alpha Bot will unlock new places to mine, give the Beta Bots more actions and generally make their life easier...but keep an eye on those pesky Cylindroid bots, since they won't pass up the opportunity to damage your guardian!&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Mechanical overview:&#10;&#10;The game is organized in rounds. In each round, an event takes place (which might involve trouble for the Beta Bots!) and the players will program actions to interact with the planet's resource-laden chambers, with enemies, with Alpha Bot, or with each other. Actions are chosen in secret and players commit to them before any are revealed. The stress level of each bot determines the turn order as well as its possible resource deliveries. Then players take turns to reveal their programmed actions, and execute them.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own robot's blueprint, where they store resources using multiple containers of limited size. Those resources can be delivered to the passing ships, or they can be transformed or spent to enhance the robot's capabilities.&#10;&#10;During the adventure, the autonomous Alpha Bot will advance through the planet's chambers until it reaches the surface. Players can interact with Alpha Bot to obtain advantages or to steer it out of harm's way, since it is vulnerable to enemy attacks and the planet's adversities.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, there's a maintenance step that includes the activation of enemy robots (Cylindroids). They can move, attack, or occupy resource chambers. Additionally, players will receive benefits or penalties (stress) according to their distance to Alpha Bot.&#10;&#10;The game ends when Alpha Bot reaches the last chamber. The players tally the victory points, which can be earned in different ways: Through successful resource deliveries, by upgrades on their robot, by fulfilling other objectives, etc. Then, each player's victory points is reduced by the amount of stress they incurred during gameplay, and the player with most remaining points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

This last die &ndash; the &quot;order&quot; die, if you will &ndash; gives players an order, and they must then decide as quickly as possible which of the colored imp pieces they must grab. An order might have them checking which color of dice has the largest or smallest sum, which color has the biggest difference between two dice, which color die is closest to the gray die, and so on.&#10;&#10;If a player takes the wrong imp (or no imp at all), he loses one of his gems. When all but one player have been eliminated, this final player wins.&#10;&#10;If you're getting low on gems, don't despair as you can sometimes gain more. If the instruction on the order die would allow you to grab two (or even three) imps, then you must instead grab the gray imp. Doing so nets you a gem &ndash; unless, of course, you're wrong.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After a long hike through the woods, you finally find the perfect place to set up your camera &mdash; a lush meadow. A green sea of grass rolls gently in the wind, spotted with flowers opening up to morning dew and gentle sunlight, and flocks of butterflies hovering above in a slow, deliberate dance. Light flickers in the golden dust, as you take the first look through your lens and get ready to capture the most beautiful of sights in your photo!&#10;&#10;Dust in the Wings is a family game of perception, planning, and picturing the beauty of nature. Built on the wisdom of Mancala &mdash; a beloved game known for thousands of years &mdash; Dust in the Wings creates an experience that is light on rules, engaging in its gameplay, and wondrous to the eye!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, Butterflies are placed on each flower in the Meadow, a 5&times;5 grid on the main game board. During each turn, a player attempts to fulfill the requirements of various objectives in order to score victory points.&#10;&#10;The board is manipulated Mancala style. The active player will choose a single Meadow space and pick up all Butterflies from that space. One by one, these Butterflies are dispersed. The first Butterfly is placed onto any one Meadow space adjacent to the space which the Butterflies were picked up from. The next Butterfly is placed onto any one Meadow space adjacent to that space, and so on.&#10;&#10;The goal is to place the last Butterfly onto a Meadow space so that the space fulfills the requirement of a Gathering objective or Composition objective.&#10;&#10;A Gathering objective is fulfilled by gathering a precise number and types of Butterflies onto a single space in the Meadow.&#10;&#10;A Composition objective is fulfilled by having a group of spaces that collectively contain a number of Butterflies indicated on the cards. The group of spaces must also match a distinct shape and size depicted on the card.&#10;&#10;Even if you managed to fulfill the requirements of multiple cards, only one card may be scored each turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, a player's score is calculated. Each Composition card is worth a number of points as indicated on the card. The values of various Scoring markers, which were collected when completing Gathering objectives, are also added to the final tally.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Prime Climb is a new board game that uses arithmetic to open a beautiful world of possibility. Players race to be the first to get to the center of the board while avoiding getting knocked back to the start by other players. Highlighting the power of the prime numbers, Prime Climb is mathematical, deep, creative, and fun.&#10;&#10;Each player controls two pawns that start at the 0 circle. Players take turns rolling two 10-sided dice and applying the values to their two pawns using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The first to get both pawns into the 101 circle exactly wins the game! Be careful: if another player lands on you, you get sent back to the start. Along the way, players who land on the red circles collect Prime cards&mdash;some are helpful now, some are helpful later, and a few are trouble!&#10;&#10;One of the great innovations of Prime Climb is the coloring scheme. Each of the prime numbers less than 10 has its own color: 2 is orange, 3 is green, 5 is blue, and 7 is purple. After 10, each prime number is red. Any number that is not a prime is a mix of colors that corresponds to its prime factors. For example, 14 = 2 x 7, so the 14 circle is half orange and half purple.&#10;&#10;The color coding allows players a way to quickly analyze the factors and multiples of the numbers on the board. This helps players check their multiplication and division, and even allows kids who haven't yet learned multiplication to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

Though Retro enables you to make use of Squad Leader and ASL components and modules, it is not endorsed nor authorized by The Avalon Hill Game Co or other publishers. Retro should be viewed as an unoffical variant to these fine games, and presumes that players own official modules and rules.&#10;&#10;Originally appeared in issues #1-#4 of Panzerschreck magazine, published here as a 48-page booklet with two pull-out charts.&#10;&#10;Signficantly strips down the sequence of play, armor rules, and morale rules of ASL. A significant innovation is the concept of &quot;hesitation&quot; (which replaces most of ASL's defensive fire rules), where units moving in the open and in range of the enemy must test to determine if they freeze in place and don't carry out their move.&#10;&#10;Designed with solitaire players in mind, or anyone wanting to play these classic tactical wargames with less rules overhead.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Qwinto: Das Kartenspiel is a card game version of the dice game Qwinto. As in the original game, players each have an individual score sheet, and they're trying to use numbers (1-18) to fill in the empty spaces in three rows, which are colored orange, yellow and purple. Within a row, lower numbers must be placed to the left of higher numbers, and no number can be repeated. In the two- and three-space columns formed by the rows, no number can be repeated, but numbers can be in any order.&#10;&#10;Aside from the score sheet, the game includes 32 cards, with the cards numbered 0-6 and -2 in four colors (yellow, orange, purple, gray). Each player starts with a random hand of three cards, then four cards are laid in a 2x2 square. On a turn, a player lays a card from their and onto one of the cards in the square, then sums that card and the two adjacent cards, stating this number and the color of all non-grey cards out loud, e.g., &quot;13 in purple and yellow&quot;. Each player can then write a 13 in either the purple or yellow row on their score sheet. If the number is less than 1 or all the cards are grey, then no one can write anything; if the active player can't write anything on their score sheet, then they must mark a penalty box instead.&#10;&#10;If a player has two cards with the same number, they can lay down one of them, then the matching number in an adjacent space, thus possibly changing the sum drastically. A player refills their hand to three cards to end their turn.&#10;&#10;When a player has completely filled two rows with numbers or all four penalty spaces on their score sheet, the game ends. Each player tallies the points for each of their rows: 1 point per number if spaces are empty, or as many points as the rightmost number if the row is full. For each three-space column, if all spaces are filled, then the player scores points equal to the number in the pentagon. For each penalty point, the player loses 5 points. Whoever has the highest sum wins!&#10;&#10;",

If you have a type of animal on your tile that no one else has, double the score for that animal.&#10;&#10;After scoring, return the revealed tile to hand, then draw more tiles to fill your hand once again.

    "Description": "South China Sea (SCS) provides an integrated political-military simulation of near future contention and conflict around the South China Sea.  Players take on the roles of China, the United States, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  They simulate current political tensions through card play and structured negotiation keyed to real world events in an effort to &quot;move the needle&quot; to their side.  Unfortunately, the cards with the greatest chance of moving that needle, such as Chinese Coast Guard and U.S. Freedom of Navigation Exercise, are also most likely to trigger armed conflict.  If and when that happens, play transitions to traditional hex-and-counter format on a map scaled at 45 nautical miles (nmi) per hex and turns of 3-7 hours.&#10;&#10;SCS is derived from Breaking the Chains (BtC), but is definitely a different game.  How do the two differ?  SCS begins with political turns that can lead to victory without armed conflict.  For armed conflict, SCS focuses more closely on the South China Sea (45 nmi per hex) rather than the larger southeast Asian region of BtC (70 nmi per hex) and uses smaller units such as air squadrons, ship pairs, and land battalions.  Therefore, the SCS map shows more detail, but less territory.  SCS employs streamlined versions of BtC's turn structure and strike mechanisms that expedite play by dispensing with numerous cycles and strike paths.  SCS nodded to ergonomics by putting all scores on one side of each counter &ndash; less flipping.  Most important, SCS allows naval units to move more than one hex in a single turn, but includes a mechanism, based on stealth, that enables the other side to &quot;check&quot; multi-hex moves to create a more dynamic, variable, and volatile environment.  This last adjustment allows quick moves at a distance, but prevents close-in ships from &quot;jumping&quot; through the beaten zone of modern anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM), 290 nmi in some cases.  And, every turn has the option for a negotiations phase with some structure to enhance political play if desired.&#10;&#10;",

The gift of petty conflict!&#10;&#10;In Bequest, players will strategically split Dr. Schism&rsquo;s fortune with their villainous neighbors! Each player draws five Asset cards, and splits them into two piles for the player on your right, who will choose one to keep, leaving you the other, while you do the same with the piles split by the player on your left. Once everyone has chosen, you&rsquo;ll collect your spoils, and soon another round will begin, this time going in the other direction!&#10;&#10;With a variety of different Asset types to collect, you&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on your neighbors to figure out what they&rsquo;re looking for, and how badly they need it. You&rsquo;ll collect matching gadgets for exponentially increasing $ values, Hideouts for set $ values, and try to avoid ending up with Evidence, which count as -$3 each once you have three or more. Global Influence earns you $10 or $20 provided you have more than your neighbors, and Schemes provide unique scoring conditions based on the rest of your collection.&#10;&#10;One Asset type is Keys to Dr. Schism&rsquo;s vault, each with a spot in the drafting order for Special Asset cards, which include the Schemes, and powerful versions of the other card types. Will you pick the smaller pile with a Key, and a chance to claim Dr. Schism&rsquo;s $5 Space Station hideout? Or play it safe with a Bunker and two power cores?&#10;&#10;Bequest packs a ton of strategy into what looks like simple decisions. Will you be clever enough to walk away with the lion&rsquo;s share of Dr. Schism&rsquo;s estate, and become the next great supervillain?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

New objects are placed at particular price values, while objects already on the board are boosted one step on the price chart because they're still in demand. In player order, based on the number cards they hold, each player chooses a deck of object cards, which represents a particular location of Japan. Everyone goes through their decks at the same time, pulling out any items that they'd like to buy and that they can afford to purchase. At any time, a player can stop looking and grab the lowest available number card.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has bought their wares, they sell them in number order from low to high, selling as many items as they wish for the current prices on offer and holding on to whatever else they've purchased. Each time an item is sold, the appropriate wanted card on the game board drops one level in value, falling off the board if demand is fulfilled. If you end up trying to sell at the wrong time, some of your collection will be worthless! If a player has 50 or more ryo, the player with the most ryo wins; if not, a new round begins with players taking the decks of object cards, searching once again for goods in demand...&#10;&#10;",

To do so, they draw dice from a bag each turn and flick two of them onto the playing area, which is mounted inside the game box. Adjacent dice and dice landing in the middle of the playing area score points and are returned into the bag. While white dice serve as jokers, red dice trigger a special scoring. Players who make best use of the die abilities and have good aim are bound to win.&#10;&#10;Open the box and start playing &mdash; Dice Flick plays just as quickly as it is set up. That leaves more time for the accessible gameplay: Draw some dice and flick your way to victory with a little bit of luck and a lot of dexterity. Even if the dice did not fly right &ndash; a game lasts 10 to 20 minutes, so there is always time for a rematch.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Iwo, Bloodbath in the Bonins 19 Feb &ndash; 17 Mar 1945, is a solitaire board-wargame using a modification of the Series: Fire & Movement combat system (Decision Games). Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves.&#10;&#10;Iwo Jima was a critical point on the flight path of US bombers from their Saipan bases to their Japanese targets. The island would be a refuge for malfunctioning or damaged bombers coming or going. An obvious target for a US amphibious assault, the Japanese had reinforced the garrison and dug miles of tunnels the length and breadth of the island. Their goal was to inflict maximum casualties on the Americans to force them to reconsider the seemingly inevitable invasion of Japan. The resulting battle was brutal, even by the standards of the Pacific War.&#10;&#10;On Iwo, the Japanese fought from within an extensive tunnel network, neutralizing the usual fire support effects and limiting maneuver to the US approach to each fortified position. The Japanese units are hidden, their strength revealed only at the instant of combat, so the US player must mass against a position to play it safe, using fire support to suppress the defenders and so reduce attacker casualties (a key victory condition]. On the other hand, the US player must clear the island to win, and time is not on his side. Sooner or later he must take risks to push the battle forward. Taking some terrain, like Mount Suribachi, is critical to weakening the island's defense.&#10;&#10;The Japanese defense is handled by a short, simple set of priorities when conducting Japanese bombardments, punctuated with an occasional Banzai charge. A weak attack against a bunker may only displace the defenders to another position, where they will have to be attacked again. The rules include an option for a two-player game, with a second player handling the&#10;Japanese forces.&#10;&#10;Note: This is a SOLITAIRE game with two-player rules included.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 2 days&#10;    Hex: 350 yards / 300 meters&#10;    Units: Company to Battalion&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 17 x 22&quot; full color map&#10;    One dual-side printed countersheet (100 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 4-page Iwo rulebook&#10;    One 8-page Fire &amp; Movement Folio Standard rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Very High&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 1 (Solitaire game, but 2 or more can play)&#10;Playing Time: 1-2 hours&#10;&#10;Players will need to include one 6-sided die for play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Table Golf Association (TGA) is the first dexterity game that allows you to design and play your own golf course.&#10;&#10;Using 25 two-sided wooden terrain tiles, you decide the layout of the course, and make it as easy or difficult as you choose. The game comes with a Tee Box and several different &quot;holes&quot;. You complete the course by adding tiles that include roughs, sand hazards, trees, water hazards, and a cliff, as well as the fairway tiles. The game includes four balls that are basically mini-shuffleboard pieces that you must flick from tee box to hole, while trying to avoid the hazards just like in real golf.&#10;&#10;If you do hit into the hazards, each one carries its own unique mechanism to replicate the challenges of real golf. For example, hitting into the sand means you must hit your next shot using the thumb of your non-dominant hand. Each hazard also limits the distance you can hit your next shot.&#10;&#10;The game also includes a weather die and spinner that must be rolled before each shot to determine the wind speed and direction. Golf pro player cards, which players can choose or deal out randomly, each have a different ability players can use once per hole.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the lowest score after the final hole wins.&#10;&#10;TGA can be played solo, one-on-one, in teams, or as a league.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The award winning game Orcs Must Die has made its way to the table top! Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame dares you to preserve your stronghold sieged by orcs. You have traps &amp; weapons galore, and can team up with your friends to obliterate the nasty orcs and their grotesque allies.&#10;&#10;Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame includes scores of figures of favorite heroes, plus hordes of orcs, crossbow orcs, kobolds, gnolls, trolls, ogres, and more. Build an exciting fortress using a tile-based system, then watch as swarms of baddies plunge through your defenses to abolish your Rift.&#10;&#10;Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame  actually consists of TWO separate games! One is based on the heroic Order, while the other is for the Unchained. Both are complete stand-alone games. In Order, you&rsquo;ll play heroes such as Maximilian the War Mage, Gabriella the Redeemed Sorceress, and others, while fending off the villainous orc onslaught. In Unchained, you play opposing heroes, such as the Kobold King or Midnight the assassin, facing down assaults by human soldiers, lions, elves, bears, dwarfs, and the like.&#10;&#10;How Is It Played?&#10;First, you and your friends choose your heroes &ndash; each individual game supports 1-4 players, who must co-operate to survive the enemy onslaught. Each hero has his own individual sheet, with his unique characteristics, special ability, and his secret superpower, that he needs to save for just the right moment. He also comes with his own special figure and his own weapon cards that no one else has access to.&#10;&#10;When you think you are ready to go, choose a difficulty level, and a map &ndash; you can select one of the maps we&rsquo;ve included, or create one of your own! A typical map is made up of from 4 to as many as 13 tiles (or even more, if you are inventing your own design). The game has a lot of pieces to play with, but the map itself is reasonably tight, and will fit just fine on a typical gaming (or dining room) table.&#10;&#10;Finally, the fight begins! Each turn, waves of orcs and other monsters move pitilessly through the map, relentlessly aiming for your poor Guardian, trying to destroy him and your Rift. You and your allies run around the map, placing traps in the various parts of your map, battling the invaders, and performing a host of other actions.&#10;&#10;You earn trophy skulls for killing your enemies, and these act as the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;cash&rdquo; &ndash; spend them to buy new weapons, magic amulets, and a host of other items. You also can spend skulls to place traps, and to upgrade your Guardian, making him better-able to hold off the orcs, gnolls, and other enemies.&#10;&#10;But over time your enemies accrue in strength, too! You have to face three Onslaughts, and with each Onslaught, your foes increase in might. If you do not lay a solid groundwork for your defenses with upgrades and trap placements in the early part of the game, you may face doom later on!&#10;&#10;Combat is straightforward and fast &ndash; you roll various colored dice depending on what type of weapons and upgrades you own. Remove &ldquo;killed&rdquo; enemies from the map, only to see them replaced by new waves each turn. The fun continues. The game builds up over time to a crescendo of doom, in which the last few turns see you frantically try to finish off the final waves of the onslaught before your crippled Guardian is destroyed!&#10;&#10;Head-to-head play?&#10;If you or your friends own both the Order and Unchained versions of Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame , you can go head-to-head, pitting the regimented Order against the legions of the Unchained in an epic conflict. You and your friends will split into two teams &ndash; one side fights for the Order, and the other will control the Unchained.&#10;&#10;Each side has its own heroes, its own armies, its own Items, and its own traps. Your hero can defend your own citadel, or seek to lead your armies to victory inside the enemy lair. With friends to help, your faction can station heroes at both tasks, and even switch off duties. The game supports up to 4 players per side.&#10;&#10;",

Each character has movement, fighting, and search skills; inventory for two or three items; and a unique special ability for use in the advanced game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, all of the characters on one team act first, one after another, then the opposite team goes. During your turn, use your action points to move your character and search on the island. If you meet someone from the other team, you can fight them, whether to steal the treasure or simply to set them back. When you search, you might find move and fight tokens to save for the future; flags that let you claim a dock on the island to make it easier to leave; or clues to the treasure. The clue tokens let you play cards, and those cards determine where the treasure will be found &mdash; ideally in a spot more advantageous for you than the other team.&#10;&#10;Once the final clue has been found, the treasure is up for grabs, with a team needing to have one of its characters possess it on a dock to which they have access at the start of their turn. Thus, holding it isn't enough as the other team can possibly steal it away on their turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The decision to invade The Marianas (of which Saipan is a part) was not an easy one. General MacArthur still favored the more westerly route through the Philippines and had support amongst the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It took several conferences and nearly a year before the decision was made. There were several reasons that the Americans finally decided to invade the Marianas: Firstly, it was the most direct route to Japan, Secondly, they could base B29 bombers there which could bomb Tokyo, Thirdly, Saipan would be the first piece of prewar Japanese soil taken during the war. Lastly, the American planners hoped that they could draw the Japanese fleet into a decisive engagement. With all these reasons, a battle for the Marianas was inevitable.&#10;&#10;On 15th June 1944 71,000 American Marines and Infantry attempted to make the plan work. 32,000 dug-in Japanese attempted to stop them.&#10;&#10;Saipan &ndash; The Bloody Rock will be the first game to utilize the new Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 2 maps. This will be your chance to experience a full-on naval invasion as Amtracs and DUKWs head towards the emplaced forces of Imperial Japan.&#10;&#10;The game will come with 4 scenarios and 2 campaign games:&#10;&#10;Dog-Day &ndash; The first day of the Invasion. It is 8 turns long and fought on a single map. An excellent introduction to both the system and the game.&#10;&#10;First Week in Hell &ndash; The first week of the invasion and the capture of Aslito airfield. This scenario is 56 turns long and is played on a single map. For the space but not time challenged players among you.&#10;&#10;Death Valley &ndash; This scenario covers a single day of the fighting and concentrates on the American attempt to capture Mount Tapotchau and the area that became know as Death Valley. 8 turns long and a single map. An excellent large battle you can play over one sitting.&#10;&#10;Shattered Jewels - This scenario covers a single day of fighting and revolves around the largest Banzai attack of the war. Thousands of Japanese attack the 105th Regiment near the town of Tanapag. Variable length but usually 4-5 turns.&#10;&#10;The Battle for Saipan &ndash; The full historical campaign from 15th June- 9th July (224 Turns). This game covers the full fight for Saipan in 1944, from the first invasion at Charan Kanoa in the south, through the long bloody fight in the central mountains around Mount Tapotchao and finally to the last Japanese stand in the north.&#10;&#10;Bloody Rock &ndash; This is a hypothetical campaign game that lets the players decide how to defend Saipan and how to invade it. The American player receives the same historical forces but now has the opportunity to devise his own landing schedule over one of 25 beaches. The Japanese player gets to prepare his own defenses; set up pillboxes, lay mines and deploy 6&rdquo; naval guns etc. Can you do better than history?&#10;&#10;Complexity: 6&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability:8&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 hours&#10;&#10;Map Scale: 1 hex = 500 meters&#10;&#10;Unit Scale: Companies and below&#10;&#10;Players: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 4 players as well as solitaire&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(Version fran&ccedil;aise ci-dessous.)&#10;&#10;In 1944, during the night of 5th to 6th June, paratroopers of the British 6th Airborne achieved three heroic missions that made possible the D-Day Normandy Landings on the East sector (Gold, Juno and Sword beaches). &#10;In Operation Commando - Pegasus Bridge, one player leads the English commandos, while his opponent is in charge of the defending German troops.&#10;&#10;Each turn, on a different battlefield (each ground having specific characteristics), players draw cards (each player has his own deck), can play events, and then an assault begins. The German plays a unit; the English answers with a unit, that must have a Combat value equal or higher than the German unit's, or reach it thanks to boosts. If it does, the German can boost his unit, then the English, and so on until a player stops. A unit's combat value can be raised by combat action cards and tokens (one side +1 Combat, one blank side) taken from the player's tokens reserve and flipped.&#10;If the English's unit is destroyed, he loses one of his 3 Manpower Points (MP) but moves to the next ground (the assault ends, as does the turn on this ground). If the German's unit is destroyed, he can play another one (depending on the ground's size) and the assault goes on. If the English destroys all enemy units present on the ground, he wins the assault and progresses without losing a MP.&#10;&#10;Players also have a pool of special cards, the powerful &quot;heroic&quot; cards, from which they secretely choose one card to add to their hand each two turns. Since heroic cards have potent effects and can't be countered, choosing them well depending on the situation of the game is strategically very important. These cards feature actual historical officers and events.&#10;&#10;The game contains three scenarios, each of which corresponding to one of the three missions that the English commandos had to fulfill this night: the taking of the bridge of B&eacute;nouville (&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;) to allow the landed troops to progress deeper inside the land; the assault on the Merville Gun Battery, a fortified area threatening the Landind beaches with long distance cannons; and the bombing of the bridges on the Dives river to prevent the tanks of the 21th Panzer Division from reinforcing the German troops. Each scenario has its own pool of cards (including heroic cards) and different gameplays.&#10;&#10;To win, the English must fulfill his objective (which depends of the scenario), by winning the assault on one or more objective grounds. To win, the German has to prevent the English to reach his goal, generally by bringing his Manpower Points to zero or, in the Dives scenario, by preventing him to destroy two bridges out of four.&#10;&#10;The three scenarios can be played in campaign mode (one after the other) to recreate the historic night. Depending on his results, the English gets more or less campaign points, and when the three scenarios have been played, his total score indicates if the D-Day Landing will be possible or not.&#10;&#10;The 120 artworks illustrating the cards are realistic and faithful to historical documents (uniforms, weapons, locations...)&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;En 1944, pendant la nuit du 5 au 6 juin, les parachutistes de la 6e Division A&eacute;roport&eacute;e Britannique (&quot;6th Airborne&quot;) accomplirent trois missions h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques qui permirent au D&eacute;barquement d'avoir lieu sur le secteur est (plages Gold, Juno et Sword).&#10;Dans **Op&eacute;ration Commando - Pegasus Bridge**, l'un des joueurs dirige les commandos anglais, et son adversaire les troupes allemandes.&#10;&#10;&Agrave; chaque tour, sur un champ de bataille diff&eacute;rent (chaque terrain poss&eacute;dant des caract&eacute;ristiques sp&eacute;cifiques), les joueurs piochent des cartes (chacun a sa propre pioche), peuvent jouer des &eacute;v&eacute;nements, puis un assaut commence. L'Allemand joue une unit&eacute; ; l'Anglais r&eacute;pond par une unit&eacute;, qui doit avoir une valeur de combat &eacute;gale ou sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle de l'unit&eacute; allemande, ou l'atteindre gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des bonus. Si c'est le cas, l'Allemand peut renforcer son unit&eacute;, puis l'Anglais peut faire de m&ecirc;me, et ainsi de suite jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'un joueur renonce. La valeur de combat d'une unit&eacute; peut &ecirc;tre augment&eacute;e gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des actions de combat et des jetons (avec une face +1 et une face sans bonus) pris dans la r&eacute;serve du joueur et jet&eacute;s en l'air comme un pile ou face.&#10;Si l'unit&eacute; de l'Anglais est d&eacute;truite, il perd l'un de ses 3 Points d'Effectifs (PE) mais avance jusqu'au prochain terrain (l'assaut se termine, de m&ecirc;me que le tour sur ce terrain). Si c'est l'unit&eacute; de l'Allemand qui est d&eacute;truite, ce dernier peut en jouer une autre (selon la taille du terrain) et l'assaut se poursuit. Si l'Anglais &eacute;limine toutes les unit&eacute;s ennemies pr&eacute;sentes, il remporte l'assaut et progresse sans perdre de PE.&#10;&#10;Les joueurs disposent &eacute;galement d'une r&eacute;serve de cartes sp&eacute;ciales, les puissantes cartes &quot;h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques&quot;, r&eacute;serve dans laquelle ils choisissent secr&egrave;tement une carte qu'ils ajoutent &agrave; leur main tous les deux tours. Les cartes h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques ayant des effets puissants et ne pouvant &ecirc;tre annul&eacute;es, bien les choisir en fonction du d&eacute;roulement de la partie est strat&eacute;giquement tr&egrave;s important. Ces cartes repr&eacute;sentent des officiers ayant r&eacute;ellement pris part aux op&eacute;rations et des &eacute;v&eacute;nements s'&eacute;tant effectivement produits.&#10;&#10;Le jeu propose trois sc&eacute;narios, chacun d'eux correspondant &agrave; l'une des trois missions que les commandos anglais devaient accomplir cette nuit-l&agrave; : la prise du pont de B&eacute;nouville (&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;) pour permettre aux troupes d&eacute;barqu&eacute;es de progresser &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur des terres ; l'assaut sur la batterie de Merville, une zone fortifi&eacute;e mena&ccedil;ant les plages du D&eacute;barquement avec des canons &agrave; longue port&eacute;e ; et la destruction des ponts sur la rivi&egrave;re Dives pour emp&ecirc;cher les blind&eacute;s de la 21e Panzer Division de venir renforcer les troupes allemandes. Chaque sc&eacute;nario poss&egrave;de ses propres cartes (dont les cartes h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques) et des m&eacute;caniques de jeu diff&eacute;rentes.&#10;&#10;Pour gagner, l'Anglais doit remplir sa mission (qui d&eacute;pend du sc&eacute;nario), en remportant l'assaut sur un ou plusieurs terrains objectifs. Pour gagner, l'Allemand doit emp&ecirc;cher l'Anglais d'atteindre son but, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement en lui faisant perdre tous ses Points d'Effectifs, ou, dans le sc&eacute;nario de la Dives, en l'emp&ecirc;chant de d&eacute;truire deux des quatre ponts.&#10;&#10;Les trois sc&eacute;narios peuvent &ecirc;tre jou&eacute;s &agrave; la suite, en mode &quot;campagne&quot;, pour recr&eacute;er cette nuit historique. En fonction de ses r&eacute;sultats, l'Anglais obtient plus ou moins de points de campagne, et quand les trois sc&eacute;narios ont &eacute;t&eacute; jou&eacute;s, son score total indique si le D&eacute;barquement sur les plages de Gold, Juno et Sword pourra avoir lieu ou non.&#10;&#10;Les 120 illustrations de cartes sont r&eacute;alistes et fid&egrave;les aux documents historiques (uniformes, armes, lieux...)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Five Separate Scenarios PLUS Campaign Game PLUS Links to Other Games of the Series.&#10;&#10;May 1915 - First Isonzo&#10;&#10;Italy decides to enter the war. Once a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy now sides with the Entente. Italy's dream is of annexing Austro-Hungarian territory inhabited by ethnic Italians. Austria-Hungary views Italy not only as traitorous, but also as its traditional enemy. The stage is set for a bloodbath. The Italian army attempts to cross a narrow path into Austria-Hungary, across the Isonzo River towards Trieste. There the Austro-Hungarian army is dug in and waiting for them.&#10;&#10;May 1916 - The Strafexpedition&#10;&#10;The Chief of Staff of the Austro Hungarian army, Conrad von Hotzendorff, feels the time is right to punish Italy. He ignores the German chief Falkenhayn who foresees problems on the Eastern Front. Conrad masses guns and men in the Tirol for a strike to cut off the Italian armies to the east along the Isonzo. The plan looks good on paper, but the attacks will take place across rugged country. The Italians in the southern Tirol have neglected their rear area defenses. Italian reinforcements rush to the area. It is a dicey affair, but the Italian lines hold fast. The peril to the Italian forces along the Isonzo is checked.&#10;&#10;May 1917 - Tenth Isonzo&#10;&#10;Again and again and again, valiant Italian infantry has been fed into the maelstrom of the Isonzo. Each battle differs from the last only by their increasing intensity. The 9th Isonzo battle brought the capture of Gorizia. Now the Italians work to enlarge their holdings on the east of the bloody Isonzo. In the end, each side is once again exhausted. The Italians have become weary of the war. Yet, the Austrians feel that one more attack along the Isonzo may be the one that breaks their army first.&#10;October 1917 - Caporreto&#10;With Russia just about finished, the German army turns to help its beleaguered ally. Crack German divisions are sent to the Italian front to remove the mortal threat to Austria-Hungary. The Austrians reinforce the front with specially trained assault units. The Italians along the headwaters of the Isonzo are overwhelmed. German and Austrian units pour through the mountain gaps and into the Italian rear. Italian units melt away in the rush to get out of the trap. The gains of the Isonzo battles are permanently lost. Enterprising Austrians cross the Tagliamento River. Further Italian retreats ensue. The rout of the Italians ends along the banks of the Piave, the last natural barrier before Venice and the open country of the Po Valley. But Italy is not defeated, and her citizens rally anew to the cause.&#10;&#10;June 1918 - Albrecht &amp; Radetzky&#10;&#10;The Germans are on the attack in France. Conrad wants in on the glory. Although the soldiers of the once proud Habsburg armies are weak and emaciated, they will have to go on the offensive one more time. As so often before, the Austrians split their strength between Conrad's armies in the Tirol and the forces along the Piave. Conrad's attacks from the north are ineffective. Once again the Marshal has made unrealistic plans his forces cannot execute. In the rugged mountain terrain only a single division manages to make any gains. Initial attacks across the Piave are successful, but quickly bog down. The Austrians have crossed the river, but cannot push far enough forward on the west bank to keep their pontoon bridges out of range of Italian artillery. Unable to advance, and unable to maintain viable supply lines across the river, they cross back, only to await the end.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;&#10;       560 Die-Cut Counters&#10;       One 34in x 22in Map&#10;       Scenario Rulebook, Charts, and Tables&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale is 20km / hex&#10;4 days per turn&#10;Unit Sizes: Division / Brigade&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Everyone knows that on the U.S. frontier in the days of the Wild West, a person could work hard as a settler who establishes a hotel or saloon or as a prospector who mines for gold and other treasures &ndash; or a person could try to take the easy way out by robbing all those who did the hard work.&#10;&#10;In Desperados, players are card sharpers, highwaymen or bank robbers who want to &quot;earn&quot; what they need to live out the rest of their lives in comfort. Well, most players fall into that category, but one takes the role of marshal and tries to keep the other players honest.&#10;&#10;During set-up, a money tile is placed in each bank, a poker tile in each city without a bank, and a stagecoach in a randomly-determined city. Each outlaw starts in a city, and the marshal has both a marshal token and a number of sheriffs equal to the number of outlaws, with these tokens starting wherever the marshal places them.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five turns, with five movement cards played by each player in each turn. Each player has an individual hand of movement cards, including a &quot;Saloon&quot; card that allows a player to stay in the same location. The marshal moves the stagecoach, moves each sheriff (or leaves them in place), then the marshal and the outlaws alternate laying five face-down movement cards. If an outlaw wants to take an action in a city &ndash; robbing a bank, a card game, or a stagecoach &ndash; he must show his location card to the marshal, then place his wooden disk on that location.&#10;&#10;Once all five movement cards have been placed, the players all reveal the first card and move their tokens. If the marshal is in the same city as an outlaw, that player is jailed and loses all movement and action for the remainder of the turn; that player also loses that movement card for the remainder of the game. If an outlaw is in a location with his action disk, he can take that action &ndash; as long as more outlaws are present than sheriffs. (Players pool their money, so there's no dispute over which outlaw robbed a place.)&#10;&#10;Once players finish their five movements, they pick up all their movement cards, the marshal replaces stolen tiles (and adds a second stagecoach in the second turn), and a new turn begins. If at the end of the game, the desperados have collected $4,000 or more per outlaw, then they win the game; otherwise the marshal wins as the outlaws &ndash; despite stealing huge amounts of funds &ndash; have not secured enough funds to guarantee their livelihood in their golden years.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of Bohnanza, designer Uwe Rosenberg and publisher AMIGO Spiel have released a special edition of the game appropriately titled Bohnanza: 20 Jahre.&#10;&#10;The rules for play are the same as those of Bohnanza: Players start with a hand of bean cards, and they cannot change the order of cards in their hand! Each bean card has a number that indicates how many cards of that type are in the deck, as well as a &quot;beanometer&quot; on the bottom of the card that tells you how many Talers you earn when you harvest those beans from your field. The more beans of a type that you have, the more Talers you earn.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must plant the first card in hand into one of their fields, and they may plant the second card. All cards in a field must be of the same type. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and optionally trades those cards and cards in their hand with cards in the hands of other players; all traded cards must be planted, not returned to hand. Players can trade cards from anywhere in their hand, and doing so lets you set up good plays in future turns. To end a turn, a player draws cards and places them at the back of their hand. You can harvest a field at any time to collect Talers, keeping some cards to represent these coins and returning others to the discard pile to be recycled when the deck is shuffled.&#10;&#10;Bohnanza: 20 Jahre adds one new type of bean to the game: the spring bean. Whenever a player harvests two spring beans, they draw cards from the deck equal to one more than the number of players. They plant one of these cards for themselves, then pass the cards around the table so that each other player can do the same. The final card is returned to the active player, who keeps it for a Taler.&#10;&#10;",

A deck of hunt cards is passed from vampire to vampire, each taking one card, reading it aloud, then passing the rest on.

Some of the animal cards have symbols triggering special actions when a player takes a second card of this species with the same symbol:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Heart: The player takes a baby animal of that species, if available.&#10;    Card: The player looks through the discard pile and takes a card of their choice. &#10;    Lightning bolt: The player must take a -1 point marker.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player collects a symbol a third time, the special action is not carried out; instead the player discards the card and takes a -1 point marker.&#10;&#10;Some cards have food stalls, which give you money if you have the same symbol (pretzels, soft drinks, or ice cream) twice. This money can be used to steal an animal from the opponent or get rid of all -1 point markers. The first player to have all different types of stalls scores bonus points.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered after the sixth in-game scoring or when the &quot;last round&quot; card is revealed.

It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each expansion increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.&#10;&#10;This first installment of Myths at War contains 300 cards split between the Nordic, Egyptian and Japanese mythologies (GDMI+GDM3 spanish editions). Each mythology includes two pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings).&#10;&#10;Each player in Myths at War needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each expansion  increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory but all expansions can be played on his own.&#10;&#10;During the game, each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, the Russian armies did not comply.&#10;&#10;He finally got a big battle at Smolensk, which could be called a French victory...except the Russian armies just retreated and burned. Now under the command of (recalled from retirement) Marshal Kutuzov, the army made a stand near the small village of Borodino, which had only marginal useful defensive terrain but was the best place to stop the French before Moscow.&#10;&#10;After two days of skirmishing and probing, the major battle took place Monday, September 7. About 250,000 troops were involved and the two armies lost about 70,000 casualties. It was the single bloodiest day of the entire Napoleonic Wars period &mdash; &quot;Bloody Monday&quot;.&#10;&#10;Using the game engine from Moscow '41 (and not VNG's Waterloo 200), the game Bloody Monday provides action and challenges, plus the joy of die rolling. Unlike other VNG products, Bloody Monday uses large 20mm blocks to provide enough detail and different unit types but still keep the game playable in one sitting. Colorful PVC stickers and &quot;fog of war&quot; give players everything they need in an easy mechanism.&#10;&#10;",

Recruit dragons from the racetrack and fire them up to get them racing. The key to your success lies in supplying your racing team with a stream of support from other dragons on the racetrack. In the end only the fastest racer will be victorious!&#10;&#10;Dragon Racer is a fast-paced card drafting strategy game that combines card drafting and set collection. Compete for cards to fire up your team of dragons and advance along the racetrack. After seven turns, the player who has gone the farthest wins! You can combine two copies of Dragon Racer to play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player gets three random level 1 dragon cards and places them face up next to their character to create their racing team. Shuffle the other level 1 and level 2 dragons to create the starting dragon deck. Remove one random upper track tile and one random lower track tile, then place the six remaining upper/lower track tiles colored-side down between the corner tiles.&#10;&#10;On each turn, reveal the next face-down racetrack tile and add its associated dragons to the dragon deck. Assign trophy cards to players according to their position in the race. (Skip this step on the first turn.) Deal each player a number of dragon cards (two + the turn number) from the dragon deck. Players simultaneously draft these cards face down until all cards are taken.&#10;&#10;One at a time, in reverse trophy order (i.e. last place goes first), players take turns racing. During this phase you reveal all of the cards you drafted, then use them to fire up dragons on your racing team or to attack other players. At the end of the phase you may swap one of the dragon cards you collected with a dragon on your racing team. Finally, the players with the most dragons from each racetrack type are awarded an extra boost, moving them even further along the racetrack.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game of the Battle of Shiloh - April 6 and 7, 1862.&#10;&#10;From a Battleline catalog:&#10;&#10;Dawn.  April 6, 1862.  The Union Army of the Tennessee is beginning to stir beneath the shadow of a small frontier church in western Tennessee.  The troops of U.S. &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant wait only for their junction with Buell's Army of the Ohio to begin their long planned advance into the heartland of the Confederacy.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly the spring morning is shattered by the rattle of gunfire and the piercing rebel yell of over 40,000 charging Confederate soldiers.  The battle is joined and the fate of the west hangs in the balance.  Can you as General A. S. Johnston drive the Union invaders from Southern soil?  Can you as U.S. Grant rally your forces and halt the rebel onslaught?  You'll never know until you've played Fury in the West'.&#10;&#10;Fury in the West is a realistic wargame played on an attractive five color 22 by 28 inch Mapboard with over 230 colorful extra-thick die-cut counters that accurately represent the opposing armies.  This game enables you to refight and study one of the least understood battles of the American Civil War.&#10;&#10;Fury in the West is one of the most accurate wargames of its kind.  Each detail has been pain-stakingly researched in order to achieve strict historical accuracy.  The system has been extensively playtested to ensure a fast moving, delicately balanced and exciting game.&#10;&#10;Rules cover such important facts as leadership, bayonet charges, gun boats, long range artillery, formations and facing and many more.  An innovative yet simple system enables players to record casualties and stragglers of their individual units.&#10;&#10;Counters:&#10;Battleline edition = 255 (10 of which are blanks)&#10;Avalon Hill edition = 234 (none of which are blanks)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a duke, you have decided to build the greatest castle in the land. You are not the only Duke in this land, though, and you are not the only one with this fantastic ambition.&#10;&#10;There are many ways to build your castle. You can even build it to lean towards one of several different styles, be it for Defence, for Comfort or even for Offence!&#10;&#10;The occasional royalty may pop by your land and if your castle does not suit his or her taste, they will leave to find better accommodations with your rival dukes! On top of that, the deadly dragon will appear once in awhile and raze the lands. If your castle is not well fortified against dragon attacks, it might just crumble! Score Victory Points (VP) by having the most number of important folks residing in your castle, as well as have the most magnificent castle of all and take home the title of Grand Duke! Castle Dukes is a very visually appealing game of Dexterity and Strategy - And it's 3D to boot!&#10;&#10;Each round, players start with 5 Coins. 6 Room cards are revealed from the stack and placed in positions 1 through 6 (from bottom to top), each room costing a higher amount of Coins to acquire than the last. The player with the First Player token gets first rights to the Room cards, passing the turn in clockwise direction until all players have had their chance to acquire rooms with their Coins. Rooms acquired leave a gap on their position and are not replaced with new cards during any player's turn. At the end of the whole turn after every player has had a chance at the rooms, any remaining room cards are then moved downwards to fill any gaps. Draw more Room cards from the Room Stack to fill all positions as needed. It is possible to choose not to acquire any Room card during a player's turn. Note: In the various positions 1 through 6, players also acquire additional castle components such as Tables and Coffers along with the Room cards, as depicted on the position on the main game board.&#10;&#10;Once done, all players then simultaneously acquire pillars, Floor Tiles, and Construction cards using their remaining Coins. They may then immediately build the newly acquired components, adding on layers to their castles until they gradually become beautiful fortresses of various shapes and heights. When all players are done with this next phase, a Guest card is revealed to show which Guests have dropped by for that turn. The princess always goes for the most comfortable castle, even if its flimsy. The king's life is very precious and he always seeks out the most defended castle. The knight looks for glory and always goes for the castle that best gives him the chance to slay a dragon. This is the end of a turn in Castle Dukes. The First Player token is now passed on to the right, and a new turn begins with each player having 5 Coins again. And yes, a dragon might appear now and then to attack all castles! Depending on your level of Defence or Offence, each castle will take varying amounts of damage.&#10;&#10;Beware! This is also a dexterity game! If at any point in the game your castle collapses, be it a small portion or even just one tiny component falling off, you will take a Crumble token which at the end of the game reduces your Victory Points by 2!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rainbow Pirates is kind of like playing Rummy on an enchanted island while being attacked by pirates drinking pi&ntilde;a coladas.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to earn as many Treasure Points as possible by placing card groups (treasure) on your island.  However, you can also attack your opponents with pirate cards (stealing or blowing up their treasure) or use them to give yourself other advantages.&#10;&#10;The game was designed to allow for multiple strategies (ranging from guns-blazing aggressive to peace-loving non-violence) based on the player's hand, preferences, and group dynamics.  (eg, attacking an opponent's island can give you the edge you need to win, but also often causes reprisals and limits the treasure you earn from Black Cards)&#10;&#10;Game actions during your turn include: placing cards (for Treasure Points), rearranging cards (to and from your island and hand), and playing pirate cards (to attack opponents or give yourself advantages).&#10;&#10;When it is not your turn, you have the opportunity to BLOCK incoming pirate attacks if you have the right matching Color Card in your hand.  (Eg, the Captain Card can be stopped by bribing him with a green &quot;Me Time&quot; Color Card)  This will stop the attack, but you lose the ability to earn Treasure Points from the card used as a bribe.&#10;&#10;A game can end in 2 possible ways:&#10;1) When a player goes out (by playing all cards from their hand AND having at least 2 full rainbows on their island)&#10;2) Running out of draw cards&#10;&#10;Going out does NOT necessarily mean you win, but you do earn a BONUS 5 Treasure Points which often is enough to give you the win.&#10;&#10;Rainbow Pirate cards are rare in the deck and highly valuable (worth 5 Treasure Points each).  They often become the focus of pirate attacks and thievery between players.  While valuable, these cards can also become a distraction, tempting players to drain too many resources to obtain them.  This game dynamic can result in interesting gameplay and strategies, especially when playing with 3 or more players.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Yet glory and riches await those few who can endure this hellish environment, for at the heart of the forest lies Talaxis, the legendary Ravening Ruin, its shattered vaults filled with a thousand artefacts of incalculable power. From the deranged plague-alchemists of the Rotmire Creed to the fanatical demolishers of the Horns of Hashut, warbands from across the realms seek to claim these priceless treasures &ndash; and will gladly slaughter anyone that stands in their way.&#10;&#10;Warcry is a game of skirmish-scale battles with larger-than-life action and tactics. Set in the Realm of Beasts, beneath the tangled boughs of the deadly Gnarlwood, rival warbands fight over territory as they make a nightmarish odyssey toward the fabled vaults of Talaxis. The Heart of Ghur boxed set gives you everything you need to start playing this game of fast-paced warband combat in the Mortal Realms, including models, rules, and a host of gaming accessories. With a strong focus on narrative gameplay, you&rsquo;ll create your own warband that vies for territory, wealth, and notoriety. Over time, your fighters will grow, earning new skills and picking up the battle scars to show they&rsquo;re willing to risk it all. Heart of Ghur takes the action out of the Eightpoints for a whole new edition of Warcry &ndash; though the Gnarlwood is every bit as grim as anything you&rsquo;d find in that blighted land.&#10;&#10;This massive boxed set contains:&#10;&#10;     160-page softcover Warcry: Core Book &ndash; loaded with art, lore, and all the rules for playing this new edition, including dynamic Reactions, game modes, and campaigns&#10;     64-page softcover Warband Tome: Rot and Ruin &ndash; packed with rules, campaigns, and background information for both of the two warbands in the box&#10;     Horns of Hashut &ndash; 10 merciless invaders sworn to the Father of Darkness.

On a turn, someone rolls the two dice, then calls out the sum. Each player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Writes this number in an empty space in their grid, or&#10;    Circles this number in their grid if it had been entered on any previous turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;Initially, of course, you can only write a number as you have nothing to circle. You're trying to do two things in Knaster: circle lots of numbers, and fill the rows, columns, and diagonals of your grid with &quot;scoring combinations&quot; of numbers, i.e., three- to five-of-a-kind, two pairs, a full house, or a straight. When you place five numbers in a row, column, or diagonal and you have created one of these scoring combinations, then you immediately circle 1-3 numbers in this same line. If all the numbers in a line are circled, you can then circle the number (5-10) outside the grid that's next to this line.&#10;&#10;As soon as someone fills in the 25th space in the grid, they let everyone know this, then after one final turn, the game ends. Your score is equal to the sum of the circled numbers outside your grid, along with 1 point for each number circled in your grid. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

In the game, players manage mineral resource companies interested in exploration of the Arctic region. They aim to maximize their scores, expressed in points, by undertaking actions that give them specific benefits or weaken the position of competitors.&#10;&#10;The path to gain advantage over the competition is on one hand the investment policy that will provide a variety of resources, and on the other - controlling a large quantity of deposits of the same type, which will allow to dominate in a given segment of raw materials industry.&#10;&#10;The tool for achieving the goal and winning the game is shaping the internal and foreign policy of the Arctic region countries (Russia, Norway, the European Union, Canada, USA). In addition to that, China&rsquo;s participation in the race for access to the Arctic resources is simulated in the game.&#10;&#10;Players may use their political powers to obtain subsidies from a given country&rsquo;s budget and to secure their investments in mining platforms built on the sea behind the scenes. However, the main axis of the gameplay is exerting direct influence upon the policies of the countries by a wide range of political and economical actions taken on their behalf.&#10;&#10;STRONG NEGATIVE INTERACTION and NO LUCK FACTOR&#10;&#10;To be released at Essen 2011&#10;&#10;",

The first player whose family tree includes all of the heroic traits necessary for them to complete the saga they're describing wins the game.&#10;&#10;During set-up, each player is dealt a random saga card; these are placed face-up in the middle of the table. Six inheritance markers of the appropriate colors are placed upon the colored icons on the saga card. Each player draws a starting hand of four hero cards. Play proceeds clockwise. Each turn consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Catch Your Breath: Draw up to a hand of four cards. &#10;    Embellish Your Story: Optionally use an embellishment for which you meet the qualifications, based on the color of your youngest hero (if one is in play).&#10;    Continue the Tale: Play a card from your hand onto your family tree.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each family tree consists of seven spots and represents the player's heroic lineage. Each hero card possesses a dominant and (in most cases) recessive trait. Traits which match those required by the player's saga may have inheritance markers placed upon them. Once all the player's inheritance markers have been placed on their family tree, they win.&#10;&#10;The player's family tree also allows them to use embellishments matching the color of their youngest hero. If second or third generation heroes of the same color are present, more powerful embellishments may be used.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Westphalia concerns the diplomatic negotiations and military campaigns that brought an end to the Thirty Years War and Eighty Years War. The question isn't a matter of who &quot;wins&quot; the war - that was decided a long time ago. Instead, each player seeks to arrive at a settlement that meets their own political, confessional, and economic goals. These goals are not mutually exclusive: if multiple players meet their victory conditions, they all win. The trick is, if all six players manage to meet their goals, then the game goes to a scoring round, and only one player wins.&#10;&#10;The result is a mix of cooperation and competition between six asymmetric factions (Austria, Bavaria, Spain, France, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic). The game unfolds in alternating Diplomacy Phases, in which anything and everything is up for negotiation, and Military Phases, in which tense cat-and-mouse chases give players the leverage they need in talks.&#10;&#10;There is no money in the game, only Debt, and you only ever seem to get more of it. At the end of the game, your Debt is reduced according to your accomplishments, and the remaining Debt is compared to faction-specific benchmarks to check for victory. Additionally, two factions must each ensure that two other specific factions meet their goals in order to meet their own: Austria must ensure victory for Bavaria and Spain, while France must do the same for Sweden and the Dutch Republic. This isn't mutual, however; once Bavaria gets what it wants, for example, it can hang Austria out to dry.&#10;&#10;This is a game for exactly six players: no more, no less. It cannot and does not scale to suit other player counts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Gen. Washington attacks Lt. Gen Henry Clinton's rearguard at Monmouth Court House.  The legend of Molly Pitcher is generally associated with this battle.&#10;&#10;The game uses Wellington&#039;s Victory's system, modified for the American Revolution era. No cavalry charges and complex rules. The main aspects of the rules include unit facing, morale modified by casualties received, command control and fatigue due to hot temperatures during the battle. Victory is determined by eliminating enemy strength points and capturing the 4 crossroads in the battle area.&#10;&#10;Map terrain has five levels in increments of 30 feet, with each hex spanning 100 yards side to side. Each infantry unit represents a regiment (or several regiments for some Colonial units); each artillery unit represents a battery of two guns; each dragoon unit represents a regiment of cavalry. Turns represent 20 minutes of real time. Three scenarios are provided: one introductory involving the hedgerow battle, and two advanced covering Monmouth Courthouse and the Grand Battle.&#10;&#10;Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine Nr.90 (Jan/Feb 1982)&#10;&#10;",

It has led to millions of settlers being severed from civilization and&#10;stranded in a galaxy, far away from planet Earth. Its history now faded in the mists of time. In this new world, five distinct human races have emerged as the primary contestants for power.

    "Description": "&quot;A Time for Trumpets&quot; (ATFT) is a battalion level wargame of the Battle of the Bulge. The game system incorporates a number of concepts from two of the highly playable games on the same subject: Bitter Woods by The Avalon Hill Game Company and the iconic battalion level Wacht am Rhein from SPI in 1977. In addition, the command and control concepts devised for the TAHGC version of The Siege of Jerusalem were utilized.&#10;&#10;The Divisional compositions include HQ, the front line battalions and the combat support battalions: recon, engineers, anti-tank, anti-aircraft and artillery. The individual field battalions perform game functions that attempt to simulate the battlefield actions of their real-life models. The aircraft squadrons include those that were most numerous over the battlefield in December 1944: P47, B26, ME109, JU88 and ME262.&#10;&#10;The game map is at the scale of one hex equals a mile and was developed using the 1-50,000 1943-1944 GSGS 4040 and GSGS 4507 topographical maps.

To set up, give everyone a ship that has room for twelve items (four under the deck out of view of others), then dump all of the equipment tiles in the center of the table. Take thirteen adventure cards in the appropriate number of the appropriate types (discovery, trade, pirates, contract), then lay them out in a circle around the equipment.&#10;&#10;When everyone is ready, reveal the adventure cards, then race to fill your ship with equipment tiles using only one hand, adding two colored goods in the special slots for those. Whoever finishes first scoops the cards up so that everyone else has to finish equipping their ship without seeing what's coming. You then shuffle the cards, then reveal them one by one:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Discovery: When this type of card is revealed, you can discard the 1 or 2 equipment tiles shown to receive the goods or money instead. Whenever you receive goods, they must be placed in an empty space on your ship; you can discard equipment to make room for them, if you wish.&#10;    Trade: You can trade the one good on the left of the card for the 2-3 goods on the right, if you wish.&#10;    Pirates: Before revealing this card, every player must say either fight or flee. If you flee, nothing happens to you. If you fight, you must be able to discard the equipment shown on the card or else you're penalized and must ditch some money and aa good; if you do have the equipment to drive the pirates away, you receive the reward shown on the card.&#10;    Contract: Place this on the bottom of the deck until only contract cards remain, then reveal them one by one. If you have the 1-4 goods showing on the card, you can discard them to get the monetary reward.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, convert every remaining good into 1 coin, then for each ten coins, convert them into a treasure chest and place it on an empty space in your boat. Now you'll have less room on board for the second leg of this trip, which plays out nearly identically to the first one.&#10;&#10;In the end, whoever has the most money wins!&#10;&#10;",

The game ends when all cards are claimed, and the player with the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;The solo version of Flash 8 asks you to re-create, using the same sliding-tile mechanism, any combination  shown on the grid of electrons laid out in front of you. Be careful, though, because every success comes with a price: every time you complete a combination, the grid changes, and if you don't manage your cards correctly, you could end up stuck!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Leg of toad and stumbling curse &ndash; which of you will be the first?&#10;&#10;Magician's Kitchen is played on a square board with five objects placed on it: a cauldron in each corner, and a fireplace in the middle.

He puts one of his ingredients in the bowl (or two, if another player has already delivered all his ingredients). Then he uses his magic wand to push his apprentice toward a cauldron in order to deliver his ingredient. If the apprentice falls, his turn ends, and he has to try again on his next turn.&#10;&#10;A player who has already delivered all of his ingredients must try to light the fire by moving the fireball (another marble) to the fireplace. If he succeeds, he wins.&#10;&#10;Magician's Kitchen uses magnets and metal balls hidden under the playing surface (at random locations) to create &quot;stumbling&quot; points which make delivering the marbles more difficult.

Cards grant columns different abilities, like gaining energy seeds, moving cards or seeds and block other players' columns. Mask cards also reward points at the end of the game based on different scoring conditions.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player gains the fourth Mask card or if a player has 18 cards in their play area at the end of the round.
