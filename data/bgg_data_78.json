    "Description": "(from Compass Games website:)&#10;&#10;On December 16th 1944, Germany launched its last, desperate offensive in the West. The result was The Battle of the Bulge, a brutal struggle in a dismal winter landscape set against an enemy imbued with a fanatic conviction that victory could be snatched from defeat. It was the United States Army's greatest and fiercest battle of World War II. Over a million men and thousands of guns, tanks, and other fighting vehicles were engaged. In those &quot;Bitter Woods,&quot; fighting against heavy odds, the American soldier slowed and then stopped the spearhead of two elite Panzer Armies, forever emblazing themselves in the annals of military history.&#10;&#10;Compass Games presents the Designer Edition of this Charles S. Roberts and ORIGINS award nominee. New to this edition are updated unit counter graphics, additional scenarios, and an extended campaign game to allow the Allied counterattack to be fully realized. In addition to the 6 and 8 turn tournament games, Patton's famous relief of Bastogne can be recreated via scenario play. Specific rules include: Mechanized Exploitation Movement, Hidden Fuel Dumps, Leader Units, Reserves, Random Events, Bridge Demolition, Kampfgruppe Peiper Breakout, Skorzeny Infiltration, Air Power, and Artillery Support.&#10;&#10;Designer Edition Bitter Woods is the premier edition of this highly acclaimed regimental level Battle of the Bulge game and includes all aspects of the original game plus the expansion edition. The potential for mechanized exploitation movement and an appropriate Allied counterattack capability ensure an exciting challenge for both sides. Designer Edition Bitter Woods is highly playable, yet historically accurate, further ensuring a game you will want to revisit for years to come.&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium (5 out of 10)&#10;Solitaire suitability: 8&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = 12 hours&#10;Map Scale: 1 hex = approximately 2 miles&#10;Unit Scale: Primarily regiments and brigades&#10;Playing Time: Small Scenarios: 3-4 hours, Full Campaign: 8+ hours&#10;&#10;",

Anyone can make one, even for profit, without paying any sort of royalties of any kind.  It is generally requested that they conform to some standard dimensions, but otherwise, they are free to make and sell.&#10;&#10;The suggested Piecepack dimensions make them compatible with Looney Pyramids.&#10;&#10;",

WHO WILL BE VICTORIOUS?&#10;You command an army of soldiers, machines, scouts and miners. &#10;Devise a plan and deploy your troops. Use strategic attack and clever deception to break through your opponent's line, but beware of bombs and enemy spies. Capture the flag, and victory is yours!&quot;&#10;&#10;Two players position their game pieces on a chess-like board but in a configuration unknown to each other: token values can only be seen from one side. &#10;On a turn, a player moves a token horizontally or vertically. If the token lands on a square occupied by the enemy, the two tokens are revealed and their values compared. If a special power doesn't come into play, the lowest value is taken off the board.&#10;&#10;To win, a player must discover the opponent's flag piece.&#10;&#10;Stratego Spin Master 50th Anniversary Edition plays similar to classic Stratego with some slight rule variations and a sci-fi/futuristic theme.&#10;&#10;This version is played on a 10x8 with 30 pieces on each team versus the traditional 10x10 grid with 40 pieces to each side. The Stratego Spin Master 50th Anniversary Edition uses the alternate highest to lowest numbering system for it's pieces, 10 as the Marshal, 2 as the Scout and 1 as the Spotter.&#10;&#10;This edition introduces 2 &quot;Spotter&quot; pieces to each side.&#10;&#10;From the instructions:&#10;&quot;Spotters target and identify the enemy calling in laser barrages from orbiting battleships to destroy them.&#10;&#10;Spotter Special Attack: Spotters may move, then use their special attack. A Spotter may attempt to attack and capture any piece on the square in front of it by guessing the piece's rank. Tell you opponent that you are 'Spotting' the piece, then guess. Your opponent must reveal the piece's rank.&#10;&#10;If your guess is correct, that piece is captured. The Spotter does not move to the captured piece's square.&#10;&#10;If your guess is not correct, nothing happens. But your Spotter is revealed!&#10;&#10;Note: Spotters can 'spot' and capture Bombs and the Flag.&#10;Spotters may attack normally instead of Spotting.&quot;&#10;&#10;A simple strategy for the Spotter is placing him behind a crater. When an enemy attacks down one of the Corridor lanes their piece is revealed. If they capture your piece and move forward, the Spotter can then flank them from the side 'guessing' their rank with complete certainty.&#10;&#10;",

With that much power, it is inevitable that he will destroy the mighty Kingdom and undoubtedly everyone in it. The King is looking for brave leaders to recruit heroes, gain power within the guilds, and race through the dungeon to destroy Blasphemy. Will you adventure through the realms?&#10;&#10;Adventure Realms is a worker placement and deck building game in which you will recruit new heroes, gain power within the guilds, and race through the dungeon. Gain powerful elemental stones to enhance certain items and heroes and gain extra end game victory points. You can also complete quests by meeting certain requirements. Stuck in lower levels of the dungeon? No worries, just play some devastating magic cards to gain the lead in the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Adventure Realms is completely done in beautiful 16-bit graphics by FinalBossBlues and graphically designed by Pete Jank. It is reminiscent to the old school Super Nintendo games such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they will play 1 of their hero cards and place an agent into an Agent Space. These spaces will gain you specific rewards. On top of that, the hero card you played will also give you specific resources or abilities for that turn.&#10;&#10;The objective of Adventure Realms is to gain Journey Flags to race through the dungeon. Once everyone has passed on their turns, players will enter the dungeon phase in which magic cards can be played to boost your levels in the dungeon. The player who had traveled through the dungeon the furthest will gain the first player rewards. The game will continue like this until a player has gained 10 victory points or until the dungeon deck has run out.&#10;&#10;",

The object is simple: Survive at any cost &mdash; and remove the alien threat before it kills you all.&#10;&#10;In a round, you will be dealt two cards. Each can be played as either your position on the ship (i.e., where you are) or an action (what you do). On a turn, you play one card, then after everyone has finished, play reverses and comes back around, with you playing the second card for whatever you didn't choose the first time. Thus, you always have one position and one action.&#10;&#10;Then the alien's location is revealed. If you share that location and you have the highest priority number, you're dead. If a crew member's action kills you, you're dead. In fact, death comes pretty quickly in this game &mdash; then ten minutes later, you are all jumping back in to play again. With a bit of skill and luck, however, you may be able to isolate the alien at one of the locations that let you jettison it into space, along with any fellow crew members who happen to be there.&#10;&#10;This isn't a deduction game; it's horror survival...if horror survival were funny.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as a deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.&#10;&#10;Yomi: Round 1 is a standalone item that contains four characters (out of twenty) for the second edition of Yomi. With these characters, you can compete in 1v1, 2v2, 2v1, and solo modes, with each player in the game needing one character deck. The character decks in Yomi: Round 1 can also be played against those in Yomi: Round 2 or any of the individual character decks that comprise the second edition of Yomi. As for the characters, they are:&#10;&#10;&bull; Grave&#10;&#10;&#10;    Versatile and powerful, including one of the most powerful super moves in the game.&#10;    If you can read the opponent well, you'll get more Dragonheart attacks than usual.&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Jaina&#10;&#10;&#10;    Jaina can attack a lot and buyback her attacks by paying life.&#10;    She can take risks with Unstable Power in order to get even more super moves than usual. &#10;    Even her blocked moves deal more damage than other characters'.&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Midori&#10;&#10;&#10;    Midori can transform into a green dragon, and then his moves are much more powerful.&#10;    He's a grappler with good defense.&#10;    In Dragon Form, he can block to fetch cards from his discard pile to build a great hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Setsuki&#10;&#10;&#10;    After doing a combo, Setsuki can usually refill her hand.&#10;    Very fast attacks. &#10;    Some ninja tricks to recur certain cards and to escape danger.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: This item contains:&#10;Yomi Starter Set: Grave versus Jaina&#10;Yomi: Midori versus Setsuki&#10;&#10;",

If a color moved farther, its color are worth more points -- but you probably spent more of that color to move it there, giving you fewer points!  Irony.&#10;&#10;The new Bucket Brigade edition by Face 2 Face Games uses the exact same rules, score levels on the racetrack, and card distribution as the original, but instead of Honeybears, the racing tokens are firemen ascending a ladder.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of the game is to collect round cards known as &quot;Monads,&quot; which look like yin-yang symbols. The players do this by Trading, Buying, and Leaping with other cards.&#10;&#10;Monad / Die 1. Million uses a deck of cards with six colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple). Half of these are called &quot;Warm&quot; colors (Red, Orange, and Yellow), and the others are &quot;Cool&quot; colors (Green, Blue, and Purple). The majority of cards has one symbol on them (known as &quot;Commons&quot;), but there is one card of each color with 2-5 colors on them (known as &quot;Bis,&quot; &quot;Tris,&quot; &quot;Quads,&quot; and &quot;Quints&quot;). At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their &quot;identity&quot; and is dealt six Commons and one &quot;Bonus&quot; card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by &quot;Trading.&quot; To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.&#10;&#10;The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can &quot;Buy&quot; a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.&#10;&#10;A player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FIEF: France is a game of dynastic ambition in which players assume the roles of nobles in the 15th century kingdom of France. Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fiefs and Bishoprics. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery, and deception!&#10;&#10;FIEF is a classic game and this edition includes a new board (FIEF France: Gameboard)!&#10;&#10;The game board represents the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre. Bishoprics include several different Fiefs' villages.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In FIEF France edition, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl, or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, they gain 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10;&#10;You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to attain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies by some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot;, and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly affect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprising&quot;!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men-at-Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Archers and Bombards. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men-at-Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

They are helped by the fact that their neighbor sorts the cards sequentially by rank at the start of the hand.&#10;&#10;Players must follow suit if they can. Hearts are trump. The winner of the trick leads the next trick.&#10;&#10;Each player will, at some point during the trick, place one card go &quot;up their sleeve,&quot; and the face value of it becomes the number of tricks (and suits) players are betting they will take.&#10;&#10;Players score points for hitting their bid, which is the face value of the card up their sleeve. They also earn additional points if they capture a number of suits equal to their bid (and they do not get this bonus if they miss their trick bid). They lose points for missing their bid.&#10;&#10;Play hands equal to the number of players. High score wins at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "THE SOO LINE is a train game set in Michigan&rsquo;s Upper Peninsula. As in many such games, the players invest in railroad companies, building track to increase the company&rsquo;s income and paying dividends to the shareholders. And as in several of Amabel Holland&rsquo;s railroad games, track-leasing and cooperation is required to get past high build costs, strict hex limits, and tight cube supplies.&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s the thing, though: this is a weird game. For one thing, there are only three railroads to invest in, and the majority shareholder makes all decisions when a company operates. This means that when playing with four or five, some players will not be running companies themselves, and will need to rely on savvy investments to stay competitive. Included in these investments are five Private Companies. Privates are seeded with goods at the start of the game and pay a fixed income each round, and each time a railroad delivers goods. Once their goods are gone, the Private closes and the owner derives no further benefit.&#10;&#10;If a railroad withholds money instead of paying dividends, its share value drops, sometimes drastically. Given enough time, the stock values for all three railroads will tank - the trick is to end the game before that happens, and when you have the most valuable portfolio. As is usually the case in these kinds of things, the winner is the player with the most money - cash on hand plus the value of your stocks. (Note, however, that no play money is provided. If you don&rsquo;t have poker chips, greenbacks will do in a pinch and make the game very interesting.)&#10;&#10;Also, there is a cat on the priority deal card.&#10;&#10;",

Guide your tribe to build the mightiest empire through the Five Ages, win the favor of the gods, and become the greatest ruler in the land of Aztl&agrave;n.&#10;&#10;Aztl&aacute;n can be played by three or four players (or two players with the &quot;Aztec Gods&quot; variant). In a multi-player game, each player guides one of the four tribes. A game is divided into five stages, called ages; at the beginning of each age, each player secretly chooses one of his power cards, and then one at a time places a certain number of his tribe pawns in one of the territories on the game board, which is divided into five different types of territory: deserts, terraced fields, jungles, mountains/volcanoes, and cities. The power card chosen for the age indicates the strength of that player's tribe and identifies one type of territory (of the five different types). The greater the domains of that player, and the greater the number of territories of that type included within them, the higher the victory point score.&#10;&#10;If a territory is disputed by several players, the strongest tribe may defeat the weaker ones &ndash; but war is not the only path to victory and peaceful coexistence with the other tribes sometimes brings greater rewards. At the end of the fifth age, the player who scores the most victory points wins. His tribe rules Aztl&aacute;n, while the time of Exile befalls his opponents!&#10;&#10;",

Favours and Blessings consist of bonus actions including refreshing Spell cards in hand, buying and selling Relic cards and gaining Clouds.&#10;The active player then rolls the dice, and through manipulation of Relic and Spell cards, create useful dice combinations:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Single die showing a high number reward Power tokens, which are used strengthen the effects of Relic cards.&#10;    A pair of dice reward Magick tokens, which activate Spell cards in hand.&#10;    Runs ( three or more dice showing consecutive numbers) reward Gold tokens, which are spent to purchase Relic cards from the Offerings and are sacrificed for Clouds.&#10;    Three or more dice showing the same number gains Cloud tokens, which are worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The first wizard to accumulate 21 or more points worth of Clouds triggers the last round of the game. Once both wizards have completed their turn thr game ends and the wizard with the most points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The core gameplay was inspired by Reiner Knizia's game En Garde.&#10;&#10;This game has received a follow-up in Flash Duel: Second Edition, which adds 10 new characters, slight balance changes to the original characters, support for up to 5 players, and new gameplay modes&#10;&#10;",

Germany is faced with mortal enemies on two fronts. She must eliminate one threat, or face being crushed between the two. The German strategist von Schlieffen plans one of the great military gambles of all time. His scheme is to concentrate to knock France out of the war before Russia can fully mobilize. The bulk of German forces will move through neutral Belgium. Graf von Schlieffen intends to fall on the flank of the French armies. He believes the French will over commit to regaining their lost provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. The Schlieffen plan runs into complications from the moment it is launched. The Belgians fight back. The British join the fray. The French display surprising flexibility. Can the invading German armies still defeat France? Or will the French, British, and Belgians stop them? This time, it is up to you.&#10;&#10;May 1915 - Artois&#10;&#10;The immediate threat to France is over. The Germans have re-deployed substantial forces to the Eastern Front. French and British reinforcements arrive in increasingly telling numbers. The French believe the opportunity has come to expel the invaders. Both sides have used the lull since 1914 to dig in. Trench lines stretch from Switzerland to the English Channel. The Germans may be weaker, but they stand inside the most extensive field fortifications the world has yet seen.&#10;February 1916 - Verdun&#10;&#10;The Germans reduced the Russian threat in 1915. Now the German Field Marshal von Falkenhayn believes he can eliminate France through a battle of attrition. An epic struggle that will sear the bodies and souls of both nations begins. Both sides will feel the effects of losses on a national scale. Yet neither will shrink from the cost of the sacrifice.&#10;&#10;July 1916 - The Somme&#10;&#10;The new British Army is ready. With German attention focused on Verdun, the British feel they have a chance to break through. An intense, week long bombardment will pulverize the German lines before the attack begins. The British climb over the top and begin to cross no-man's land. The Germans survived the shelling and doggedly defend their line. Bitter fighting will last for months in the valley of the Somme.&#10;April 1917 - Nivelle's Offensive&#10;The French are now led by General Nivelle, a hero of Verdun. He plans a two pronged attack against the German salient pointing at Paris. He intends for his &quot;Army of the Rupture&quot; to be through German lines in a day. The problem is the Germans also see the potential of his plan. They retreat to the formidable defenses of the Hindenburg Line. Nivelle plows ahead regardless. The soldiers of the French army are rather unhappy with the result.&#10;&#10;March 1918 - The Great Offensive&#10;&#10;The Russians are out of the war. The Germans now concentrate in France with divisions trained in new assault tactics. The Stosstrupen are aimed at the weak point of depleted British lines. The Germans will have to win before tanks and American troops will tip the scales against them. Can the British and French hold out until a counter-offensive is possible? Or will the war drag on into yet another year?&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;&#10;     1680 Die-Cut Counters (6 countersheets)&#10;     One 34in x 22in Map (5-2)&#10;     Scenario Rulebook, Charts, and Tables&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale is 20km/hex&#10;4 days per turn&#10;Unit Sizes: Division/Brigade&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game covers the French insurgency war against FLN in Algeria during 1954-62. It is a conflict of great drama. It cost the lives of at least half a million Algerians, it brought the tumultuous exodus of one million French settlers from Algeria and it brought France itself to the brink of civil war. But to be portrayed as a game has its difficulties, though. How do you recreate the fact that the side which lost militarily won the war? How do you make it interesting to play when FLN never succeeded in creating an army, like the Viet Minh did in the Indochina war, and therefore was never able to rival the French?&#10;&#10;To address this, the game contains &ldquo;three games&rdquo; within the game: A political, an insurgency and a military game. Politics are driven by chits which alter four parameters: FLN structure; Algerian population; Pied noir feelings (the French settlers in Algeria) and French public/government. Each one will affect the play, in different ways, when it changes. What eventually ends the game is when the French public reaches 0 and calls for a referendum. Then you check each region whether they will vote to stay with France or become independent. If a majority votes pro-France, the French player win and vice versa. It is through different insurgency or counterinsurgency actions that you will make a region pro-FLN or pro-France. Finally, the military part will allow you to contest or control regions. This will affect your ability to mobilize, tax and conduct insurgency/counterinsurgency actions.&#10;&#10;In other words, you will have to fight to control, conduct insurgency/counterinsurgency actions in order to win the hearts and minds of the population and, through politics, see to it that the public in France either supports you or gets fed up with the war. Some things might help you in one way but at the same time give disadvantages in other aspects. Nothing in war is purely a good decision. There is always a cost.&#10;&#10;Each year has four gameturns. You start the game with eight random political chits of 28 possible ones. Each chit may only be played during a certain time span and after you play a chit you will draw a new one.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;operation points&rdquo; are the main engine in the game. You will receive a certain number of points and with these points you will pay for everything you do, like recruiting or bringing in reinforcements, certain movement, fighting and conducting insurgency/counterinsurgency actions.&#10;&#10;FLN recruitment will depend on how pro-FLN the Algerian population is and how efficient the FLN structure is. It will also depend on population density and whether they control a region or not. The French can bring in new units and replacements, but it will cost operation points and put pressure on the French public. So the reason to attack is to control/contest as much as possible and to force the opponent to spend operation points to replenish his force.&#10;&#10;The counters have no movement points. With a gameturn of three months there is no lack of time to position units anywhere on the map. You follow the road network (as French) but it will cost you operation points when you pass regions which are controlled by the enemy. FLN moves off-road and will have some limitations to whether they may leave a region or not. The numbers represent strength and quality.&#10;&#10;Fighting will include combat chits which in certain combination will affect the combat. My first ambition is to minimize the amount of tables in order to make the game faster to play. You roll a number of dice corresponding with your strength and modify your roll with the difference in quality. You get a hit when you roll 5-6. The complexity and difficulties lies more in what to decide and when to do it.&#10;&#10;Best regards&#10;Kim Kanger&#10;&#10;&#10;",

On a player's turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot's speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents (either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path). if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals.&#10;&#10;However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately most of them have failed to learn any significant magic in their first year. Susie coasts by on her natural talents, Malkar would sooner sell his soul for power than read a book, Nyvetta has forgone that option along with opposable thumbs upon accidentally turning herself into a bear, Flitter is only here to steal magic items to sell on the black market, and Bramblethrone spends too long talking to trees to get anything done. As a group of students, they could not be worse.&#10;&#10;Wizard's Academy is a co-operative game of magical experimentation for 1-6 players. In each game, the players select a scenario, such as summoning and binding a demon to steal its powers, defending the academy against an attack by an army of Imps, or (in the most difficult scenario) facing an academy inspector whom they must impress with their mastery of magic.&#10;&#10;Players move around the academy collecting glyphs in order to cast spells. At first, the effects of the spells are unknown, but as the players try new things, the students gain the power to manipulate the academy, the creatures within it, and the fates themselves &ndash; ideally achieving their goals before the monsters and elements that they've accidentally summoned reduce the building to smoking rubble.&#10;&#10;",

Secure the right cards before your opponent does, snatch up the more valuable ones, and host prestigious events! Each time you acquire a new card for your farm, you activate an entire column of cards, causing your farm to flourish. However, you must also earn the resources to cover the costs of these cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of three game rounds, the player with the most victory points emerges as the winner of this peaceful competition, having contributed the most to the development of Foriro!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FOR-EX is the game of currency trading. An opaque, nerdy, butterfly-effect game, players take on the roles of international financiers who trade and manipulate currency values. Each of the game's several currencies only has value relative to one another, and these fluctuate according to player investments and divestments.&#10;&#10;Players primarily make money by making long-term contracts to trade an amount of currency X for its equivalent in currency Y. Those contracts will be resolved several turns hence, during which time the exchange rate may have changed. But the contract is resolved according to the original, agreed-upon rate, enabling players to make profit. Players can (and should) make contracts promising money they don't yet have, and may use the resultant loans to give them a temporary leg-up (provided that they think they can make up the difference before the loan comes due).&#10;&#10;Once the game begins, there is zero randomness; every subtle, lovely tweak to the game state is the net result of the decisions each player makes. The game concludes when a player goes bankrupt, or when the last dividend has been paid. At that point, all monies are converted to the single strongest currency, and the player with the most money of that type wins.&#10;&#10;",

No one knows how to play this mysterious game &mdash; until now when this ancient game is reborn as Ominoes.&#10;&#10;In this abstract strategy/tactical game, 2-4 players want to collect their favored gods &mdash; Horus, Ra, Apep, and Khepri &mdash; in groups to earn points. They do this by rolling custom dice that both determine actions and are placed on the game board to count as a piece of the player's color. On a turn, the active player does the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Roll: Take a die and roll it.&#10;    Move: Move a die on the board that matches the rolled color exactly three spaces.&#10;    Place: Placing the die just rolled on the board, possibly scoring a group.&#10;&#10;&#10;The dice have four faces matching the players colors, with unused colors in a two- or three-player game being scorable by anyone. The other two faces &mdash; &quot;Yay-Ra&quot; and &quot;Ominotep&quot; &mdash; allow the player to move or reroll any die, respectively, and they count as wild once on the board. Groups of four (or more) dice of a color are scored immediately and give their player points equal to their number.

Each round, players must steal from one of the five moneybags, drawing tokens from the chosen bag.

The moneybag not only found your hand in their pocket, but they also recognized the small but precious ring on your finger...&#10;&#10;It's wise not to sit on the loot too long in case you get caught. Dealers will pay you for the loot you turn in, giving you points. You can also use your loot to complete orders, but one of your fellow swindlers might be faster and push you aside to complete a task, costing you valuable points. Thankfully, you don't have to swindle on your own! Hire accomplices to gain advantages or affect the other players with disadvantages.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after a set number of rounds will be recognized as the most notorious swindler of London and thus win the game.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of 2018, the last coal mine in Bottrop closed its doors, bringing to an end an era in the Ruhr region that is second to none.&#10;&#10;The game Schichtwechsel takes up this theme and shows simplified typical areas around the coal mining in the Ruhr area of the 1950s. As a player and administrator of a coal mine, you experience an exciting competition and live through a piece of Ruhr Valley history. You bring coal and overburden from underground to the surface, let your miner go through a &quot;shift at the colliery&quot;, produce coke, or build the typical colliery settlements.&#10;&#10;A game of Schichtwechsel takes place over five rounds, and each round consists of three phases: The preparation phase in which, among other things, the amount of mined coal is determined; the action phase in which players use their action pieces wisely in turn; and a small end-of-round evaluation. After the fifth round is a final scoring. Schichtwechsel offers you many possibilities to get the best out of your coal mine in order to score as many victory points as possible at the end.&#10;&#10;This game is the revised and improved version of the game Die letzte Zeche, which was created between June 2017 and March 2018 as a contribution of the games group Fair-Spielt of the Spielezentrum Herne to the funding project &quot;GL&Uuml;CK AUF JUGEND&quot;.

    "Description": "(from GMT web site :)&#10;&#10;Glory III is the third game in GMT's popular American Civil War series, Glory. This series presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play combined with solid historical insight. Glory III follows the success of Glory II: Across the Rappahannock, and presents a polished system with ease of play, with two combat-intensive one-map battles. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.&#10;&#10;Glory III features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Both battles have special command problems and some new and interesting mechanics to allow the players to play within the framework of those conditions.&#10;&#10;Antietam, one of the major battles of the war, makes great use of the Glory activation system, linking the Union/McClellan command problems directly to its use. But it still allows the player to make choices, choices different from those Little Mac made, perhaps changing the course of the battle.&#10;&#10;Cedar Creek is a great momentum battle, with an initial, probably highly effective Confederate surprise attack followed by the return of General Phil Sheridan to the battlefield, the arrival of George Custer's repeater-armed cavalry, and, hopefully for the Union Player, enough of a counter-attack to snatch victory from Jubal Early's rapidly munching jaws. Has Jubal bitten off more than he can chew? Grab your wallet, roll the die and find out!&#10;&#10;Designed gloriously by Richard H Berg, Developed with consummate skill and dedication by a new star on the industry horizon, Jim Dauphinais, playtested to a fine edge, and featuring the usual eye-popping, drool-inducing GMT graphics, Glory III is the best game yet in the Glory series.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 22 x 34 backprinted map&#10;     2 counter sheets&#10;     Rulebook&#10;     1 die&#10;     Player Aid Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;Designer: Richard Berg&#10;Developer: Jim Dauphinais&#10;&#10;Game 3 in the GMT Glory: The Battles of First & Second Manassas and Chickamauga, 1861-63 Civil War game series. This series features battles recreated at the Brigade level with each game in the series featuring 2 battles from the Civil War. In this edition of the series the two battles are Antietam and Cedar Creek.&#10;&#10;The Glory system features a unique chit activation mechanic. This results in players unsure of when or if a certain field commander will carry out your orders. The game system is designed for playability over bookkeeping. The main rules are only 12 pages long.  Scenarios run from 2 hours for Burnside's late afternoon attack at Antietam, up to 6 hours for Cedar Creek and up to 12 hours for the full battle of Antietam (if it needs to go the distance for a decision).&#10;&#10;",

Five-sided Hecatomb cards depict a variety of horrid creatures, from terrible beasts and demons to crazed shamans. Cards feature four clear edges, with scores for power and abilities on the fifth edge. Players can create frightening creature hybrids called Abominations by stacking cards on top of each other. Each Abomination combines the powers and special abilities of all the creatures used to assemble it. The clear edges allow players to see the total power scores and abilities of up to 5 cards stacked together.&#10;&#10;Designed for two or more players, Hecatomb's base set is made up of 144 cards. The starter game contains 40 random cards, a rulebook, and a counter sheet, and had a suggested retail price of $12.99. Booster packs contain 13 cards and had a suggested retail price of $4.99.&#10;&#10;This game has been discontinued as of 5/24/2006 there were two expansions for it:&#10;&#10;Last Hallow's Eve: Released 10/28/2005 (144 new cards)&#10;Blanket of Lies: Released 02/24/2006 (72 New Cards)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of the most well-known tales in the history of literature comes alive in Avalon Hill's strategy game for two players, The Legend of Robin Hood. The setting is 12th century England, before the signing of the Magna Carta, as the daring outlaws of Sherwood Forest oppose the Sheriff of Nottingham, Sir Guy of Guisbourne, and the evil Prince John. In the absence of King Richard, it is a land beset by the oppresions of nobles and clergy whose only concerns are their own well-being.&#10;&#10;As Robin Hood, you must enlist the support of the local populace (including Little John, Will Scarlet, and Friar Tuck) and rob the rich to give to the poor. As the Sheriff of Nottingham, you must ensure the safe passage of the wealthy through the area, tax local villages to raise money, capture and hang the outlaw leaders, and help to prevent the return of good King Richard from the Crusades.&#10;In a typical game-turn, Robin Hood will move his forces from area to area, trying to best position them for recruiting new people and ambushing travelers passing through Sherwood Forest. The Sheriff player will position his forces in an attempt to protect the travelers and possibly trap and capture the outlaws. Battles occur when both players have forces in the same area, and are resolved by die rolls representing archery and melee combat.&#10;The archery contest, disguises, and the marriage of Maid Marion are all features of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Offshore is a lightweight competitive strategy game about this highly specialized industry.&#10;&#10;In the game, players build oil platforms in the North Sea. Opening a new oil field is, of course, not easy as it requires both technology and temporary co-operation between players. On your turn, you perform one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Buy a technology tile&#10;     Export oil (selling it for points and money)&#10;     Open a new oil field and drill for oil&#10;&#10;&#10;Opening a new oil field is the most complex action: Alone, or together with one other player, you must have the required technology and also pay the opening cost. Who should use which technology and how the cost should be split must be agreed upon between the players. The players then drill for oil in a small press-your-luck mini game: The players must decide how deep they want to drill, all the while avoiding too much pressure building up as this could result in a blowout. The combination of technology tiles used for opening the field will also influence the drilling in various ways.&#10;&#10;The temporary co-operations and players' shared interests in the drilling phases makes for an exciting game in which players share both successes and failures.&#10;&#10;",

Similarly there are eleven Heathen kingdoms for the Heathen players to use. Play happens at an individual, human level as well as at the movement of nations level.&#10;&#10;Each player has two Farmers, two Merchants and two Priests. A number of these can be placed after conquest into lands occupied by the kingdom just played. Farmers collect two bronze coins for plains and one for hills. Merchants collect two silver coins for ports and one for roads. Priests collect two gold coins for temples and one for cities. Players may have only one of their Patriarchs in any one land. Players may share occupation of a land, but only one type of Patriarch may be in each land.&#10;&#10;Players use the coins generated by their Patriarchs to buy artefacts that influence game play but can instead choose to secure objectives on the Kingdom track to highlight the development of the nation and score victory points of course! A variety of strategies are available, and players must make choices throughout the game in order to emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Twin Peaks is the sixth installment in the Great Battles of the American Civil War (GBACW) series, published by GMT Games. Two full battles are included:&#10; Cedar Mountain&#10;August 9th, 1862.  With the Peninsular Campaign winding down, Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Maj. Gens. Stonewall Jackson and A.P. Hill to attack Maj. Gen. John Pope&rsquo;s new Federal Army of Virginia  with 27,000 troops.&#10;&#10;Gen. John Pope, hoping to draw attention away from Maj. Gen. George McClellan&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Peninsula, moved against the rail junction at Gordonsville, Va.   Stonewall Jackson found USA Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks&rsquo;s division isolated.  Jackson crossed the Rapidan River to engage.  Pope ordered Brig. Gen. James Ricketts&rsquo;s division to unite with Banks&rsquo;s forces on high ground near Cedar Run, seven miles south of the town of Culpeper.  These two forces met in the afternoon heat.&#10; South Mountain&#10;September 14th, 1862.  After the CSA success at Second Bull Run Gen. Robert E. Lee believed the demoralized USA armies could not respond to any bold action.  Thusly, he planned a campaign to raid Maryland and Pennsylvania and to threaten Washington D.C. itself.  Once again Lee confidently divided his army to both move north and neutralize the large Union garrison at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.&#10;&#10;However, the Union Army under Gen. George B. McClellan was quick to recover from the Bull Run defeat and was already in pursuit of Lee.  The gods of war smiled on the Union troops as a copy of Lee&rsquo;s orders fell into Union hands.  An attack through the lightly held gaps at South Mountain would cut Lee&rsquo;s army in two and perhaps end the war.  At 6:00 am the Union Army moved.&#10;&#10;The Great Battles of the American Civil War Series:&#10;This series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental level Gettysburg game -Terrible Swift Sword (SPI)- designed by Richard Berg in 1976.  Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles.  The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the oftentimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level. &#10;&#10;&#10;The Game:&#10;Twin Peaks contains two battle games each with its own full size map on one double-sided mapsheet. Experienced players will be able to play either in one sitting.  Both battles highlight the effects of fatigue from the late summer heat and the difficult terrain.  The optional fatigue rules are mandatory in both battles.  The Cedar Mountain battle also includes optional units which could have joined the battle.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The Army of the Potomac and its generals had failed the test of battle again and again. In September, Robert E. Lee invaded the North. One more victory might have turned the war in favor of the Confederacy.&#10;&#10;In desperation, Lincoln placed George B. Mc-Clellan in command. The pursuing Union army caught up to the Confederates at Antietam Creek.&#10;With the Confederates outnumbered 2 to 1, and on Union soil, McClellan had the chance to end the war in a single day. It was the bloodiest day in the history of America. In A GLEAM OF BAYONETS, the map illustrates the orchards, corn and wheat fields, as well as the &lsquo;Bloody Lane&rsquo;, which were bitterly fought over.

Harness the power of technology, expand territories, and enlist famous (and sometimes infamous) personalities from across history. Civilizations face constant threats from rival nations, natural disasters, social unrest, and the ever-looming possibility of a dark age.&#10;&#10;The objective of Nova Era is to build the greatest civilization. This is done by strategically choosing the most beneficial technologies, territories, and personalities from the tableau, evolving them as the players go through the annals of time. Players score by having a variety and/or majority of different technology types, as well as fulfilling various card objectives.&#10;&#10;Gameplay revolves around drafting and spending dice, with different dice types providing different resources, bonuses, and penalties for players. Overextending your own dice leads to civil unrest, and dice unused by players fill up the progress bars of natural disasters and the Dark Age, affecting all players across the table. Once all dice actions are taken, an era ends and a new one begins. At the end of three eras, the game ends and the most prosperous civilization wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 2035.&#10;&#10;Humanity is on a brink of extinction and we can&rsquo;t blame anyone but ourselves.  Even despite all the warnings, we were still clogging our sky with smoke and dust driven by short sighted greed. Our planet once green and beautiful, keeps on turning into deathly gray colors.&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s why the world&rsquo;s brightest minds set into motion this great undertaking. The plan is to transform what we&rsquo;ve already created, into something that would heal our poisoned world and ensure our survival. It&rsquo;s in your hands to design the most efficiently working city, that will take us closer to salvation.&#10;The game&rsquo;s theme is strictly linked with the idea of solarpunk. The core concept is set around the state of the environment we live in. Increasing pollution might air and water to become luxury goods. The solution? Conscious urban planning to use city buildings to produce clean energy, oxygen, and water.&#10;&#10;Various buildings are already being used in the real world in such manner and we can find examples like Bosco Verticale in Milan or Pasona Urban Farm in Tokyo.&#10;&#10;Solar City is a game where players design the future city. In each turn players choose one of the 3 actions:&#10;&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Build a Skyscraper that will bring you profits in the moment of activation&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Build a Public Buildings, that will improve the city structures&rsquo; performance.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Activate the Vertical Farm &ndash; cover the Skyscrapers in green, activate the wind turbines, release the water flow, install photovoltaic panels, transforming it into a real factory of bioenergy and oxygen.&#10;&#10;Each action will activate a part of the city. The player who did that will get the profits from the buildings placed there and, more importantly, will block the possibility of activating this part of the city for the other players. This mechanic force players to adapt their strategy to new situations with each passing minute.&#10;&#10;The game contains over a dozen different building types. In every game only six of the will be used. Additionally, the game contains random set of Public Buildings. Thanks to that, every Solar City game will be an unique experience.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over the set number of rounds (depending on the player count) or up until the moment when one player fills their entire board. The winner is the one who contributed more to the positive change in worlds environment (gathered the most Oxygen Points).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chandragupta brings the art of war in ancient India to GMT&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Battles of History&rdquo; Series.  Beginning with Chandragupta Maurya&rsquo;s victories over the Nanda clan, the game follows the brief but rapid rise of the Mauryan dynasty, from Chandragupta&rsquo;s expulsion of Seleucus from the Indus river valley to the conquest of the last independent kingdom on the subcontinent, Kalinga, by his grandson Ashoka.  The Mauryan empire became the largest and most powerful in India&rsquo;s history &ndash; a distinction that would remain unchallenged until the arrival of the Mughals some 1,700 years later.&#10;&#10;Chandragupta simulates the traditional &ldquo;four-fold&rdquo; division of the Indian military system, with the elephant corps reigning supreme, and the hordes of light infantry regarded as little more than fodder for chariots&rsquo; wheels and trampling pachyderms.  Chariots still play a prominent role on the Indian battlefield of the era, but the cavalry, with its versatility and endurance, is a potent competitor.  In Chandragupta, victory goes to the commander who can master the unique aspects of the differing Indian military &ldquo;classes&rdquo; &ndash; the professional, lifelong soldiers called Maulas, the mercenary levies, unpredictable tribal allies, and the militias of the powerful trade guilds.  While Maulas and mercenaries are commanded under a single hierarchical command structure, the tribals and the trade guilds are led by independent chiefs.&#10;&#10;Units include cataphracted elephants, &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; four- (and sometimes eight-!) wheeled chariots, and even an &ldquo;elCH&rdquo; unit &ndash; yes, elephant-pulled chariots.  Rules include Combined Chariot/Infantry and Elephant/Infantry lines, Dharmayudda or &ldquo;just&rdquo; warfare, Guild enmity, and Tribal loyalty.  EL units can even breach camp walls and pull down city gates (if they don&rsquo;t rampage first).&#10;&#10;Fans of GBoH will appreciate the exciting variety in Chandragupta&rsquo;s scenarios, from huge set-piece battles on flat plains, to tribal suppressions, a night assault on a military camp, and street fighting in the city of Takshashila.  Chandragupta is the 13th volume in the series.&#10;&#10;Battles:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pataliputra (319 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s mentor, the Brahmin Chanakya, brashly challenges the Nanda dynasty with a cadre of mercenaries.&#10;     Maghada (317 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta again confronts the Nandas, who are this time led by the formidable general Bhadrasala.&#10;     Mayalaketu (317 BC) &ndash; Chanakya attacks the turncoat general Mayalaketu and his rebel army in camp.&#10;     Takshashila (316 BC) &ndash; the Thracian general Eudamus, allied to Indian king Ambhi, defends the city of Takshashila against Chandragupta&rsquo;s assault.&#10;     Gandhara (304 BC) &ndash; former officer of Alexander the Great, now &ldquo;Master of Babylonia,&rdquo; Seleucus I Nicator crosses the Indus river to invade Gandhara, and is confronted by the Mauryan army at the river&rsquo;s banks.&#10;     Revolt in the Provinces (275 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s grandson, Ashoka, brings a relief force to lift a rebel siege of Takshashila and rescue the aging Chanakya who is holed up in the city&rsquo;s palace.&#10;     Khashas (274 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s son, Bhindusara, puts down a confederation of the independent Khasha kings with an attack on their mountain strongholds.&#10;     Kalinga (261 BC) &ndash; the most famous battle of the Mauryan era, Ashoka&rsquo;s army attacks the kingdom of Kalinga in a huge &ndash; and bloody -- set-piece battle.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This is accomplished whilst never sacrificing the character of individual units, and indeed all the colour and eventfulness of battle.&#10;&#10;A vast array of war machines will be at your disposal, but this does not belittle the importance of the humble infantryman.&#10;&#10;The game is built around the concept of rapid deployment and redeployment of your forces by airborne dropships, exemplifying the pace of combat on the battlefields of the future. This makes for a tactical and fast paced experience, where quick thinking and strokes of genius often bring victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Look, Enemy Anemone is a trick taking game featuring cards with numbers. There's not really a lot of theme here, but you've got to admit the name is pretty fun to say. Anyway, let's get to the game.&#10;&#10;Choose one suit per player; each suit has ranks 1-10. Shuffle the deck, then deal ten cards to each player. Set the nine anemone cards within reach. The start player plays one card face up in front of themselves. Each other player in clockwise order must play a card face up in front of themselves in a suit that has not yet been played into the trick. If a player cannot play a suit that has not been played, they discard a card from their hand into their score pile. The highest card played wins the trick and takes all cards played into their score pile. The lowest card played takes an anemone card, which can be added to a card in a future trick to increase that card's value by 1 per anemone card played. If cards tie for the highest or lowest value, the later played card breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;Once all cards have been played, players score 1 point per card taken, with the 3s, 5s, and 8s of each suit being worth an extra point. The player who has the lowest score at the end of the hand gains one anemone card.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score starts the next round. Play four rounds, then the player with the highest score wins! In case of a tie, the player with more anemones remaining wins.&#10;&#10;",

This means that the flowers have been cut from the player's field. When all players have chosen one die, the round ends, then the player on the left of the active player begins the next round. The game ends when at the end of the round a player has:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Cut all flowers in three colors, or&#10;    Cut all flowers in four of the six fields.&#10;&#10;&#10;You can score bonus points if you have the fewest unhappy customers.

    "Description": "&quot;June 3. Cold Harbor. I was killed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Thus read the last diary entry, found in the pocket of a dead Union soldier. He had made the entry himself, while all around him, other soldiers were writing names and home addresses on slips of paper and pinning them to the back of their coats.&#10;&#10;These veteran soldiers knew what was coming, although it seems their commanders did not. Three full corps launched a disjointed attack against well-entrenched Confederates. In just eight minutes, the attack had petered out. Over 7000 Federals covered the Virginia soil. A few minutes later, the orders came down to renew the attacks, but at each level, from corps commander to captain, the orders were &quot;followed&quot; only by increased firing -- most of it blindly -- while remaining in position.&#10;&#10;Grant said, &quot;I regret this assault more than any one I ever ordered.&quot; Today it sounds more like WWI madness than part of Grant's successful campaign to end the Civil War.&#10;&#10;But it was not so easy on the other side. While one CSA staffer called it &quot;perhaps the easiest victory ever granted to Confederate arms by the folly of Federal commanders,&quot; from Lee's point of view, anything could happen. His army had &quot;not a regiment&quot; in reserve, and the volume of sound -- &quot;It seemed more like a volcanic blast than a battle,&quot; -- rattled windows all the way back in Richmond.&#10;&#10;Not War But Murder covers the week-long operation which marked the end of Grant's 30 day, &quot;smash 'em up&quot; campaign begun at Wilderness. Like a bloody chess match, Grant and Lee made move and counter move to get to this point, with Lee well aware that a false move could end the war quickly.&#10;&#10;Not War But Murder, by designer Michael Rinella, is his newest area-map game, and his first take on an American Civil War battle. This game includes one 22&quot; by 34&quot; inch area map, 176 5/8&quot; counters, and 16 pages of rules and charts that include extensive examples of play, designer notes, and variant rules. It also marks the debut of what Rinella calls the &quot;diceless advantage&quot;. In previous area-impulse games, from Monty&#039;s Gamble all the way to the Avalon Hill games of the early 1990s, an &quot;advantage chit&quot; allowed the person holding it to re-roll an single die roll (or rolls if it was a combat). In NWBM this changes. The player may spend the advantage to gain specific game benefits, automatically. Thus, rather than being hoarded, this &quot;twist of fate&quot; is likely to hop back and forth, as each player strives to save a desperate situation.&#10;&#10;What is most amazing about NWBM is how much of a &quot;game&quot; it actually is, offering both players challenges and fateful decisions to make, in this classic face-off of well-known leadership. What will you do?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the Age of Rebirth, thanks to the discovery of a new type of catalytic energy and the special individuals who are able to exploit it. These rare individuals, known as &ldquo;Catalyst&rdquo;, use this energy to act together in a sort of interconnected network. Can you make the most of their superhuman abilities to lead your city to fame and fortune?&#10;&#10;This is a simple yet deep game of engine-building and powerful combos. You will carefully build up your chain of actions, and then finally pull the trigger to perform all them at the same time!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, a random Goal card is revealed. This will set various ways to score extra victory points at the end of the game, thus deeply affecting the available strategies.&#10; The game is turn-based and on your turn you must choose to perform one action among the following three:&#10;&#10;-Take a number of coins equal to the highest cost visible on the Catalyst cards displayed on the board.&#10;&#10;-Pay the indicated number of coins to recruit one of the available Catalyst cards on the board. The cost is altered by the current position of the card on the board. Once recruited, you can put the Catalyst card in one of the buildings you have managed to build.&#10;&#10;-Activate one of your recruited Catalyst cards to perform its effect. These will provide you several bonuses and actions like gaining extra coins, building new buildings, recruiting other catalyst cards from the board, obtaining military power tokens which will score for majorities at the end of the game, or allowing you to immediately activate other Catalyst cards. Whenever you activate a Catalyst card which is located in one of your buildings, the building provides an additional effect.&#10;&#10;Activated Catalyst cards go into your scoring pile, while buildings always remain in front of you.&#10;&#10;Buildings are also extremely important due to the fact each additional scoring indicated on the Goal card is related to a specific building; this means that you can score for it only if you first have managed to build that building.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out of cards, there is a final round and then the game ends: players score points according to the Goal card as well as for the majority of Military power tokens and activated Catalyst cards. Whoever gathered the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

A card display is filled with the remaining chili pepper cards, with up to three cards of the same value being placed on top of one another.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into two phases: In the first phase, players collect chilies, taking cards from the display and placing them on their personal ingredient stack. Whoever plays the highest combination of the same cards is the first to use the display. After all the ingredients have been taken, the card display is refilled and the chili collecting continues. This phase ends when no one has cards in hand.&#10;&#10;For the second phase, the previously accumulated chilies are taken into hand. In addition, a new display with sauce tasks that can be fulfilled is made available. Now the players can decide each round whether they want to collect more ingredients or use their chili-card combinations to complete a sauce task to receive chili points. The hotter the sauce, the more points you score. Depending on the number of players, the game ends as soon as someone has prepared 3-6 sauces and has no more chili cards. Whoever collects the most chili points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Natur&quot; contains historical events related to nature, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Rick and Morty 2-Pack is a standalone game that includes, as you might expect, the characters Rick and Morty.
