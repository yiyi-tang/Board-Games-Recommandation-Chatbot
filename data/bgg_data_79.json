    "Description": "Camden is a game about drawing and laying cards (acting as tiles) to form a highly abstracted street market. What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation.  Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.&#10;&#10;Players advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.&#10;&#10;Since revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass&#039;s Hip Pocket Games series. The game was originally released as Agora in 2002, with the theme of an ancient Greek marketplace.&#10;&#10;",

But rough seas mean that a little luck goes a long way.&#10;&#10;Cannons do the greatest damage, that is when their powder isn&rsquo;t wet or they don&rsquo;t miss. But cannons take long to load and you&rsquo;ll be able to do more attacks by tossing hand mortars, throwing dirks, or firing flintlock pistols.&#10;&#10;But those aren&rsquo;t the only tricks these pirate captains have! Summon a lost pirate from the depths of Davy Jones&rsquo; Locker or even persuade an enemy pirate to join your crew!&#10;&#10;And, even in the heat of battle, fate can smile down upon this lowly lot and uncover treasure! No pirate can resist treasure &ndash; especially if it contains voodoo that helps them fight!&#10;&#10;Once you destroy the pirate enemy, you&rsquo;ve won!

    "Description": "Following on the success of No Retreat! where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up yet again to present the third chapter in this game series, No Retreat 3: The French &amp; Polish Fronts.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Phony War&rdquo; ended in May of 1940 as the German Army unleashed blitzkrieg attacks into Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg in preparation for their audacious plan to invade France. Dubbed &ldquo;Case Yellow&rdquo; (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.&#10;In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Manoeuvring forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.&#10;&#10;Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, &ldquo;Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940?&rdquo; His research yields a resounding, &ldquo;Yes!,&rdquo; and the simulation elements of No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, complete with a 2-sided mounted map and oversized counters, the 1939 Polish Campaign was also added.&#10;&#10;This little-simulated battle will see many new concepts implemented into the &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo; game system. Given that both sides had never seen battle before and the units were mostly untried and green, a &ldquo;Fog of War&rdquo; game system is in use, adding much replayability to this simulation. Since that this game is fast, a complete contest will consist of two plays, with each gamer taking both sides in turn, trying to best the opponent&rsquo;s performance. Some intriguing &ldquo;what if&rdquo; hypothetical historical options are also added: Could have France intervened more effectively, the USSR acted differently? What if Czechoslovakia was never taken over by the Nazis? Poland better prepared? All these and more are yours to try out. No Retreat!&#10;&#10;French Front Scenario Listing&#10;Regular Game: The May/June 1940 campaign, but with an added twist. Both players will draw/choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan Card&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives. There are over 6 different cards from each side, all taken from actual historical plans; the success of which will add critical Victory Points if the game does not end in &ldquo;Sudden death&rdquo;. What if Hitler had attacked in winter 1939 like initially planned? Or the French Air Force had been better prepared?&#10;Historical Game:  The May/June 1940 campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives.&#10;Simulation Game: Both sides will be given the plans/set-up used during the actual campaign. Fall Gelb no5 for the Germans, Plan Dyle A or B for the French. The game also starting with the offensive already underway, Liege taken and Holland invaded.&#10;Operation Dynamo: In this scenario the German &ldquo;Sickle cut&rdquo; maneuverer towards the sea is almost completed! As the Allies, will you be able to save the British expeditionary Corps, evacuating it at Dunkirk, or even better, pierce the enemy lines and re-join the main French Army down south?&#10;&#10;Polish Front Scenario Listing&#10;Regular Game: The September 1939 campaign, but with extra choices. Both players will secretly deploy most of their troops on smaller strategic maps. One side or the other could have some extra &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; choices for the deployment of their troops.&#10;Historical Game:  The September 1939 campaign, with the exact historical set-ups of both forces. For this contest the players will take each side in turns. So the scenario will be played two times.&#10;Alternative History game: Players will explore many &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; alternatives. Some randomly determined, some planned by choice. That scenario will be linked to the French Front game and its outcome can affect the set-up of the latter.&#10;&#10;Number of Players : 2&#10;&#10;Ages: 14 and up&#10;&#10;Playing time:  Approximately 50 minutes for each scenario; 3 to 4 hours for a campaign game, 2 hours for the Poland mini-game.&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is one Army or Corps: Each hex is about 30 kilometers from side to side. Each turn represents four days of real time, except the first turn, which is only two days.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Triumph of Chaos: The Russian Civil War 1918-1921 v2 DELUXE EDITION&quot;  is a two-player card driven strategic board wargame wherein the players assume the roles  of the RED (Communist Forces) and the WHITE (reactionary forces).  This epic conflict resulted in the toppling of three centuries  of Romanov rule and its replacement by a totalitarian communist ideology.  Set against a backdrop of the vast and spectacular Russian countryside, only the Russian winter could surpass the brutality of the fighting.  Belligerents  included the various Russian republics, anarchist and independence movements, adherents of the old regime, foreign contingents of volunteers and the overt intervention of the Major Powers.&#10;&#10;&#10;With Triumph of Chaos v2 DELUXE EDITION, the original wargame published in 2005 has been enhanced to provide a richer playing experience (more Social Revolutionaries, eastern warlords and a gaggle of obscure personalities and entities), a bigger map (enlarged 40% and including the Trans Siberian rail line all the way to Vladivostok),  better play aids and redesigned cards (setting the stage for more player angst). The basic structure of the original game is still there with three phases to a turn: Political (players compete to push or pull fractions to their side), Action (players alternate playing cards to move, fight, enact events and build up their armies) and Logistics (replacements and a variety of new intriguing game mechanics):  Triumph of Chaos v2 DELUXE EDITION remains the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of chaos, continuously shifting front lines and rich flavor.&#10; Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the box: a beautiful 44&rsquo;&rsquo; x 34&rdquo; double map, 220 cards (action, leader, political decks), 3 sheets of counters (including approximately 400 military units, 40+ leaders and a bundle of other game tokens), rulebook &amp; supplement, very helpful play aids and few game bits (wood and dice).&#10;&#10;Designer: D. B. Dockter&#10;Artists: Tim Schleif, Terry Leeds, D.B. Dockter&#10;&#10;So, how does Triumph of Chaos v2 compare with v1 (which was published back in 2005 and then expanded in 2007 by the Comrades' Guide)? The categories of improvement:&#10;&#10;* A richer game experience&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;     More card angst/decision tension: Significant revisions to the Action Cards (the majority of them) to reflect learnings from new research and hopefully make the choices faced by each player more gut wrenching. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Invited the Socialist Revolutionaries to the party: The SRs now occupy a &ldquo;buffer position&rdquo; between RED &amp; WHITE in the east as the game begins; making for a nail-biting opening. The SRs may go either way as governed by a track and play of both Political and Action cards with significant ramifications for both players. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leader state: A few leaders now have an alternative &ldquo;state&rdquo; (ex: Kolchak: drug abuse, Mai-Mavesky: debauchery, etc), making them more unreliable than your usual wargame leader counter. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Far east part of the story added: Japan, Far-East warlords and red partisans are all now apart of play. &#10;&#10;&#10;* A little less clunky game engine&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A few tweaks to the basic game engine: artillery, tanks and air are now simply &ldquo;assets&rdquo; that modify combat die rolls. A Resource Center mechanic now controls where replacements may be spent (much more reflective of historic constraints). &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Infighting: Gameplay impacts the composition of each player&rsquo;s in-fighting pool; changing the internal political dynamics that both players must manage. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Better Faction rules: A streamlining of the Ukraine and Poland rules. Nips and tucks to Makhno, West Ukraine and Finland. &#10;&#10;&#10;* ..and improved kit &amp; bits (game look &amp; feel)&#10;&#10;&#10;     Doubled the map: Most of that is a result of simply &ldquo;blowing up&rdquo; the original map by 40% (for our tired/old eyes) and adding the Far East and Trans-Siberian railroad all the way to glorious Vladivostok. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bigger counters: Armies &amp; leaders are now represented by 1&quot; x 1/2&quot; in counters (basically double the size as before), while corps have 5/8&quot; counters and only informational markers get the wargame traditionally small &frac12;&quot; counters. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bigger &amp; better game aids: Faction Control Table larger and contains better information regarding the factions&hellip;force composition charts now provided&hellip;summaries of game mechanics/combat..and components explained, abbreviations, changes vs v1.0 summary!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each card has a value from 1 to 10 in the upper left corner. A card can be played face up on the table only if its value is equal to or less than the current number of cards in the archive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In this dodgeball card game, go head to head with your opponents collecting cards while throwing and avoiding squishy, adorable Avocados. Play Throw Throw Avocado as a standalone sequel, or use the BONUS deck of cards included and combine them with the cards from Throw Throw Burrito to unlock a new combo game using all four throwables!&#10;&#10;How it works: Place a pair of avocados on a table and draw cards. Keep your cards a secret. Rack up points by finding sets of three in the deck. Find matches before anyone else does. If someone plays Avocado Cards, a Battle ensues. Steal points from your opponents by hitting them with squishy toy avocados. Declare war on your friends. Some battles only involve a handful of players. Others force the entire table to engage in a Avocado War. Duel to determine the winner. During an Avocado Duel, two players must stand back to back, walk three paces, and FIRE.&#10;&#10;There is no distinct turn structure. All players are picking and passing cards constantly, similar to Spoons. Once a player has a match of any of the varieties, play will change to the various Avocado Duels - Double Brawl, Legs Duel, Freeze War - where some or all players will throw the squishy Avocado at other players.&#10;&#10;To win a player has to accumulate a set number of points. Collecting matching cards and matching battle cards earns positive points, and losing Avocado Duels earns negative points. The first player to reach a specified amount (usually five), wins.&#10;&#10;- A fun new sequel to Throw Throw Burrito, the world&rsquo;s first ever dodgeball card game.&#10;- Collect matching cards, earn points and throw Avocados at one another.&#10;- Includes 120 cards, instruction manual, 6 Avocado Boo Boos, 1 Fear Me Badge and 2 foam Avocados soft enough to throw at your Great-Aunt Martha without feeling guilty.&#10;- Includes a BONUS combo pack of 36 cards that can be combined with your Throw Throw Burrito cards to play the ultimate, epic combo game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.&#10;&#10;The deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered. If, for example, cards showing 3, 1 and 4 bananas are on the table and the 3 is then covered by a non-banana card, suddenly five bananas are showing and somebody better be reaching for the bell.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tabletop baseball simulation game.&#10;&#10;In 1971, Time Inc (owner of Sports Illustrated magazine) published their first baseball game, titled Sports Illustrated Major League Baseball.  It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.&#10;&#10;Also in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 &quot;best&quot; players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.&#10;&#10;The All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to The Avalon Hill Game Co when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted The Avalon Hill Game Co the right to use the words &quot;A Sports Illustrated Game&quot; on any The Avalon Hill Game Co sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.&#10;&#10;Special dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.&#10;&#10;",

When you spend operation points you will only be allowed to spend one, two or three points in a row before it is your opponents turn to spend his.&#10;&#10;This creates a game where you, in the long term, will have to plan and save supply and at the same time be prepared to react to your opponent's actions. &#10;In the short term you will be forced to make decisions based upon the number of operation points you have been given to spend in a row and the missions you need to accomplish.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    22&quot; x 34&quot;  map    &#10;    352 each .6&quot; Game Counters&#10;    24 pages rulebook&#10;    4 ea. 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; Charts&#10;    3 ea. 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; Information&#10;&#10;&#10;5 Scenarios + Campaign Game&#10;&#10;Map Scale:    12.5 miles per hex&#10;Unit Size:    Regiments / Battalions&#10;Time Scale:    1 month per turn&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Bridge Troll, you and your friends are hideous trolls who each guard a troll bridge. Each turn, you throw boulders to bid for travelers, who vary in number depending on the weather for that day. Travelers include fat merchants, pilgrims, poor monks (who make good eating), and if you are lucky, royal personages. As travelers come to your bridge, you use them to collect tolls. But watch out! Knights, bandits, dragons, and vicious Billy Goats Gruff prowl the countryside. You'll have to use some of your boulders to chase them away (which means you&rsquo;ll have fewer left to use on your bridge!).&#10;&#10;Although you need to collect tolls from travelers so you can buy building supplies, working on your bridge makes you hungry, so you will have to eat some of your travelers instead. It is important to balance tolls with food in order to make your bridge very appealing to travelers. If you eat too many travelers or just collect money, you won't be able to fix up your bridge. The player who uses toll-money, food, and boulders to build the most impressive troll bridge operation wins the game.&#10;&#10;First of two &quot;Troll&quot; games by the designer, the second being Trollhalla.&#10;&#10;",

Now players must base their air assets and ships (down to the cruiser level) on the map and move them to respond to threats. Air-naval combat, commerce raiding, anti-submarine warfare, and naval construction are all accounted for while preserving that Krieg design elegance you know and love.&#10;&#10;Finally, there&rsquo;s Dice of Decision II, a much-expanded update to the Random Campaign Generator featured in Totaler Krieg! As before, you&rsquo;ll be able to create new, very different Second World Wars based on alt-history paths from the Great War and the 1920s and &lsquo;30s. What if the Tsar still ruled Russia? What if Germany had won the war in 1917? What if there hadn&rsquo;t been a Great Depression? New for DoD II is everything related to Asia and the Pacific &mdash; now you&rsquo;ll be able to explore what might have happened if there were no Washington Naval Treaty? What if Japan&rsquo;s 1931 involvement in Manchuria had unfolded differently? What if Gandhi had gained independence for India? Naturally, your alt-hist Europe and Pacific games will still link to tell a completely original Global War story.&#10;&#10;",

In turn, players place in the game either cards depicting influence of their syndicate, or neutral cards representing rich districts (victory points) as well as barracks (which cancel syndicate influence around those areas). Cards must be placed so that they touch at least two cards already in play and must have at least two edges aligned on the edges of the cards that it touches.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player plays their last syndicate card. Then, players win neutral districts if they have more syndicate cards than their opponents around. Neutral districts give 1 victory point per symbol on them, and a +2 bonus if the district depicts the favorite field of the player's syndicate. The player with the most victory points controls the city and wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

It was with fervor and conviction that all of them took the &quot;flower with the gun&quot; to the battlefield. During the battles of the borders and the Marne, the losses amounted to more than 1,128,000 men of all nationalities, with about 293,000 killed.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Were there any strategic errors?&#10;     Was there a bad evaluation of the forces involved?&#10;     Was there serious military incompetence on both sides?&#10;     Or was it the macabre result of a brutal confrontation between two heavily armed military blocs?&#10;&#10;&#10;With 1914 - Nach Paris you can try to find the answer to questions like these.&#10;&#10;Finely modeled units of the belligerents, an accurate and representative topography of the theater of operations and the various fortified obstacles, the accuracy of the chronology of the disposition of troops and highly detailed logistical networks are modeled to faithfully simulate the first big confrontations of the Great War.&#10;&#10;1914 - Nach Paris offers small to medium sized scenarios to play only a specific part of the campaign as well as the option to play the great campaign scenario &quot;En rase campagne&quot; to simulate the first six weeks of World War I in the West. The belligerents need to obtain a decisive victory or face the slow descent into trench warfare.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Prepare your plan and your equipment, watch the location that you want to rob, recruit skilled specialists and be ready for anything! Use your specialists to make a fortune while staying one step ahead of the rival gangs, perform Heists all around the world, but don&rsquo;t forget the golden rule: never rob twice in the same city! Now, it&rsquo;s time to roll the dice&hellip;&#10;&#10;---- ---- ----&#10;&#10;GOAL OF THE GAME:&#10;Recruit the best specialists and assemble your dream team. Rob casinos, Banks and jewelries from the biggest cities in the world. Gain millions and become a legend.&#10;&#10;---- ---- ----&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW:&#10;A seemingly simple action, such as choosing 1 die from a small common pool, becomes surprisingly multifaceted here. 1 die, only 1 die per round. And a maximum of 12 rounds available to create the perfect gang of specialists to perform 7 heists. Each Specialist requires 1 die to be recruited and 1 die to be activated. Obviously you would like to recruit 1 Specialist per round, because only having a large gang you can make the most profitable heists. You would also like to activate her/him, because she/he will provide you with the necessary equipment. But at the beginning of each round you will get that one, single die.&#10;&#10;You will therefore need to be able to recover other dice from bonuses or through the same effects of the specialists you have recruited. Ah, yes, the specialists ... If you have many with the same competence you can get very powerful activations and unlock unique skills. But it will be hard to perform the heists, because very different skills are required in each city. If, on the other hand, your gang is varied, you will have easier access to different casinos, banks or jewelries. But will the weaker activations be enough to provide you with dice, equipment and anything you need for the next rounds? &#10;Finally, remember that you are not alone at the table and that the other gangs are not sitting back.&#10;&#10;Which die to choose? How to create the best gang? Differentiate or specialize? Spend the dice or keep them for later? Behind a system of relatively simple rules, there are deep choices that require a good dose of strategy and planning. And the ability to face unforeseen situations. Because the dice, when thrown, do what they want ...&#10;&#10;Finally, the most difficult challenge, the solo version, in which you will have to deal with the possibility of being discovered by the Interpol or defeated by the other gangs before the game is over!&#10;&#10;---- ---- ----&#10;A PLAYER'S TURN&#10;&#10;1 - Choose 1 die&#10;Choose 1 die among the available dice and slide that die on your Player Board so that it occupies the rightmost free space.&#10;&#10;2 - Use a Specialist Card&#10;Spend your dice to use a Specialist Card from the display. You may either&#10;- Recruit a Specialist Card in your team (white die of this card), then activate their Ability (black die) if you want;&#10;or Become an Informant: Receive the reward indicated on the Informant Card.&#10;- or Fast-Play a Specialist Card (activating them directly from the display, without taking the Specialist in your team)&#10;or Become an Informant: Receive the reward indicated on the Informant Card.&#10;&#10;3 - Perform a Heist&#10;Perform a Heist in a town to gain millions and special rewards. You need to have the required Skills and Equipment.&#10;or Become an Informant&#10;Receive the reward indicated on the Informant Card.&#10;&#10;---- ---- ----&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:&#10;1 - A player performed 7 Heists.&#10;Complete the current round, then proceed to the final scoring.&#10;2 - The 12th Informant Card is revealed at the beginning&#10;of the round.&#10;Complete the round (each player plays once), then proceed to the final scoring.&#10;&#10;---- ---- ----&#10;WHO WINS&#10;The richest player (in millions) wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Phantom Fury - The 2nd Battle for Fallujah&#10;This solitaire game simulates, at tactical scale, the combat waged by US forces during the month of November 2004 to secure the city of Fallujah and crush insurgent resistance. The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.&#10;&#10;The player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.&#10;&#10;The map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.&#10;&#10;The troops of each side are represented by &lsquo;unit&rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.&#10;&#10;Insurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.&#10;&#10;At the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&bull; 17x22 map&#10;&#10;&bull; 88 &frac12;&rsquo;&rsquo; die-cut counters and 140 5/8&rsquo;&rsquo; counters&#10;&#10;&bull;  1 player aid&#10;&#10;&bull; 1 die&#10;&#10;&bull; Rule booklet&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Catchup is a simple abstract game with a devilish dynamic. The goal is to have the largest group of stones on the board when the board is full of stones, but as you get closer to winning, your opponent gets more powerful. Whereas most stone-placement games are about position, Catchup is about timing, position, and the interplay between them.&#10;&#10;Definitions:&#10;&#10;1. Group &ndash; a set of connected, like-colored stones on the board. A single stone is also considered a group.&#10;&#10;2. Score - your score is the number of stones contained in your largest group. At the beginning of the game, both players' scores are set to 1&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;1. One player owns the white stones and the other owns the black. White begins by placing 1 stone on any empty space. &#10;&#10;2. From then on, starting with black, players take turns. On your turn, you may place 1 or 2 stones, or up to 3 if your opponent's score increased on their last turn and is, at the beginning of your turn, greater than or equal to your score.&#10;&#10;3. After taking your turn, if your score has changed, move your pawn to the corresponding spot on the scoring track.&#10;&#10;4. The game ends when the board is full. The player with the largest group wins. If the players&rsquo; largest groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren&rsquo;t the same size. Whoever owns the larger of the two wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players must bid with adventurer cards of the same value - but variable number of cards - and at the end of the round all players get only 1 adventurer card.&#10;&#10;If someone collects too much treasure card of the same kind, he/she is eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score (who is not eliminated) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Star Trek CCG 2nd edition is a reinvention of the original star trek customizable card game. One major difference in Second Edition was the addition of a cost system to equipment, events, personnel, and ships. A card's cost is listed in the top left-hand corner of a card, directly preceding the card's title as a single digit number (currently anywhere from 0 to 9). A player receives seven 'counters' at the beginning of each turn; to play a card, the player must spend a number of counters equal to the cost of the card. Only interrupts (of the card types in a player's deck) do not have a cost and are treated as 0-cost.Another major change in the gameplay of Second Edition was the new method of handling dilemmas. Instead of using First Edition's lengthy procedure of a 'seed phase', which could last upwards of 15 minutes, Second Edition employs an 'on-the-fly' method for constructing dilemma combinations. While First Edition attempted to sometimes literally represent instances from the Star Trek universe in the game, Second Edition has focused more on a consistency of gameplay as a priority over design consideration with regard to remaining faithful to the source material. Effects on cards sometimes lack the &quot;Trek sense&quot; that First Edition cards contained and can be purely conceptual, but are generally much more equitable when compared with other similarly costed effects.&#10;&#10;",

Set in 14th century Italy, Ventura puts players in control of warring noble houses, each vying for control of the country's growing wealth. Balance your house&rsquo;s earnings and maintain your hired soldiers to keep your family&rsquo;s noble standing. Remember, the best armies are also the ones that cost the most!&#10;&#10;With more than 120 plastic pieces, 40 Territory tiles, 4 Family Boards, a scoring board, and over 100 cards, Ventura will whisk players into a world of warring mercenaries and noble families, all seeking control of Italy&rsquo;s burgeoning wealth.&#10;&#10;Added...&#10;&#10;Players build a variable map from randomly drawn hexagonal terrain tiles, then maneuver numbered pieces representing groups of associated cards, various types of military units and their leaders.&#10;&#10;But the game is financial as well as military. Because everything in this game costs money. Pay money to draw a card. Pay more money to PLAY a card. And once those troops are in action, you better be prepared to pay them every turn or they'll leave. You can use your money (florins) to buy victory points directly (only 30 to win the game). BUT, that leaves you with precious little funds for your defense. Can your opponent(s) field an army fast enough to take out your capital (for the win) before you get there with money?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humorous card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.&#10;&#10;A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).&#10;&#10;If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.&#10;&#10;The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Monkey Business&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance, The Initial Campaigns on the Western Front in WWI realistically covers the battles fought in Belgium, France, and Germany during the first months of World War One.&#10;&#10;1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance (translation: Offensive to excess) is a comprehensively researched model that explores this fascinating set of campaigns with an accurate order of battle and detailed game map. The map encompasses the entire theater of war from the English Channel to the Swiss Border. The game system used is a streamlined derivative of the 1914, Twilight in the East system, modified to speed play, with care not to lose focus on those aspects of warfare that made the opening stages of WWI so unique. This game system, in conjunction with the accurate map, allows the German advance to be conducted along historical routes with the eminent &ldquo;Open Flank&rdquo; present (instead of units strung out from map edge to map edge). The Allied player has an opportunity to recreate a &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; type victory or to stop the Germans earlier. Likewise, the German player has a chance to change history and defeat the Allies&rsquo; armies in 1914.&#10;&#10;The Grand Campaign scenario covers the period from the fall of Liege on August 16th to exhaustion at Ypres in mid-November. Two shorter scenarios, The Battle for Lorraine (a learning scenario) and From the Marne to Stalemate are also provided.&#10;&#10;1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a playable &ldquo;Monster Game&rdquo; designed with the expressed goal that the majority of the game can be completed by four dedicated players in one five-day long Expo. The 24-page rules booklet is concise, well written and organized. The game is exciting and gives wonderful insights into one of the most important campaigns of the twentieth century. The result is that 1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a game that the &ldquo;WW1 enthusiast&rdquo; must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.&#10;&#10;Time Scale: Game turns vary between two and four days in length.&#10;Map Scale: Eight kilometers per hex.&#10;Unit Scale: Division/Brigade.&#10;Number of Players: one to many (well suited for four players).&#10;&#10;Game Designer: Michael Resch&#10;Research and Design Assistance: Rian van Meeteren&#10;Developed by: Dick Vohlers&#10;Map Design Assistance: S.

    "Description": "Dungeon Legends is a cooperative, standalone card-based game set in the world of Chronicles of Avel. Throughout the game, you'll take on the roles of heroes embarking on a dangerous mission deep into the dark dungeon. A fully replayable campaign of 5 engaging chapters awaits you, where you must reach the deepest depths and defeat the evil lurking there, whilst preventing monsters from reaching the Castle.&#10;&#10;What's it about?&#10;&#10;The game is divided into 5 chapters, each describing the party's expedition into the dungeon. They must brave searing flames, unravel the enigma of ancient machinery, explore forsaken mines rich with magical Dust, outrun torrents of molten lava, and ultimately confront an ageless evil. We encourage experiencing the chapters in order, as that will provide you with an engaging campaign of increasing difficulty, however, each chapter provides a stand-alone challenge that can be approached repeatedly.&#10;&#10;Each player embodies a hero with a unique deck, reflective of their individual style. As the game unfolds, you'll discover new cards that will expand your abilities. A player's turn consists of playing cards from their hand, applying their effects, attacking monsters, and using areas to their advantage. The basic rules remain consistent across all chapters, but each one introduces new cards, special rules, and unique goals for achieving victory.&#226;&#128;&#175;&#10;&#10;",

Several different clans call Neemus home, including Wolf Clan, Hedgehog Clan, Rabbit Clan, and the Owl Clan. While the many clans have called this land home for as long as they can remember, they know they were not the first to live here. On the edge of Neemus lies a place the clans call Iron Forest, filled with strange looking structures and creations. Upon deeper exploration, the combined forces of Animal Clans discovered incredible technology that they quickly learned how to use, creating their own amazing machines that helped them develop their own civilization. However, one day, Iron Forest sprang to life and rose into the sky, building machines of their own. This Iron Force has one objective: to take back the technology stolen from Iron Forest. Now Animal Clans must fight back to protect their homeland.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Iron Forest is a flicking game for 2-4 players, split into two opposing teams: Animal Clans or Iron Force. Each scenario offers asymmetrical objectives that each side needs to fulfil in order to win. Scenarios involve players trying to control certain areas of the game board, destroy opposing team mechas, collect certain objects, and much more. On their turns, players draw cards from their team's activation deck, then activate the mecha depicted on that card by either flicking it or launching it. Players also have access to a range of different power-up cards that will grant their side unique abilities, turning the tide in their favour!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "TROLL, published by Oink Games in 2015, is a revised version of Dragon Teeth Washer, originally published by Drosselmeyer in 2012. In TROLL, each player takes the role of a thief, trying to steal precious jewels from the hideous troll.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player receives a set of six tokens, with numbers from 0 to 5. Depending the number of the players, some troll cards are not used (Troll cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15). On a round, players attempt to steal from the target troll by playing his or her tokens in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target troll (the top troll card) and plays one of his number tokens face up. If he or she plays a &quot;3&quot; token, it means that the player intends to steal 3 jewels from the target troll. Next players have two options: 1) look at the troll card just as the first player did and play a number token face up; or 2) play a number token face down, take a multiplier (x2) token from the pool, and put the multiplier token on his or her face down number token.&#10;&#10;After all the players played their number tokens, the troll card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the troll is &quot;9&quot; and Amy played &quot;3&quot;, Becky &quot;5&quot;, Carlos &quot;2&quot;, and Dave &quot;3&quot; with &quot;x2&quot; multiplier on it, Carlos (2), Amy (3), and Dave (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) jewels respectively. However, Becky will receive a penalty point (-2), since she woke up the troll. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the troll's rampage.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds/days (set of rounds), depending the number of the players. The player with the most jewels at the game end is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

This was the code name for a relief attack by Heeresgruppe Don to free the trapped 6th Army in Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;The Axis formations entered with 50,000 men and 250 tanks, while the strength of the Soviet formations was reported to be about three times that. For the enterprise to have any chance of success, the troops in the encirclement had to break out and meet the advancing Axis troops. The breakout had to be precisely coordinated with the advance of the relief troops and was to commence on the cue &ldquo;Donnerschlag&rdquo;. The breakout was never ordered and the troops in Stalingrad were never able to be relieved. This sealed their fate.&#10;&#10;Players will be recreating this episode, with the Axis side attempting to secretly establish and reach a meeting point, thus effectively freeing the 6th Army, while the Soviet will try to impede such outcome.&#10;&#10;The Scale&#10;&#10;A hex represents 4 kms (2.5 miles) of terrain from side to side.&#10;Each turn represents a period of 1-2 days.&#10;Combat units are mostly Brigades &amp; Regiments for the Soviets and Romanians, Battalions &amp; Abteilungen for the Germans.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "King Philip&rsquo;s War is about an all but forgotten New England Indian Uprising that nearly brought the Puritans to their knees. In the end, over 6000 Indians were slain or captured and sold into slavery. Over 2600 Colonials were captured or killed. In the end King Philip (The Wampanoag sachem, Metacomet) himself was ambushed, beheaded, and quartered. King Philip's hands were sent to the authorities in Plymouth as proof of his demise. Countless Indian villages had been burned; twelve Colonial settlements were completely destroyed and six more heavily damaged. Boston itself very nearly came under attack. In all, 1200 homes were burned, 8000 head of cattle lost, and vast stores of food destroyed. Some sources claim one soldier in ten on both sides was either injured or killed.&#10;&#10;The game's treatment of this broad conflict is simplified. Only a handful of key settlements are named for historical interest while rivers and settlements are placed not so much for geographic and historic accuracy but for ease of play. The forces involved are also necessarily reduced to infantry level create a simpler, quicker game.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: Approximately 2-3 months&#10;Map: Point-to-Point movement&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;&#10;",

With the shadows to thank, the Borgia family is at the peak of their power. In a week the Cardinals will gather for the Conclave. With your reputation you could never win the seat, but you may be able to control who does!&#10;&#10;HOOK: It's like Coup meets Liar's Dice! A quick and glorious game of lies and deceit! Richly thematic and completely immersive.&#10;&#10;WINNING CONDITION: Having secretly controlled the Cardinal who has the most influence at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS: Players are randomly given an identity at the beginning of the game. It is imperative that they keep their identity secret from the other players. These identities represent the Cardinal who they want to gain the most influence.&#10;&#10;6 cards representing Cardinals, are randomly placed in an ascending ladder-like line up. A Cardinals position on this ladder determines how much, if any, influence they will gain at the end of the turn.&#10;&#10;Using dice and bluffing in a similar fashion to Liar's Dice, players will be able to manipulate a Cardinal's position on the ladder; or manipulate how much influence they have; or even accuse another player of the Cardinal they are controlling.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, if another player has accurately paired you with a Rumor Card, one that matches your secret identity, you lose; regardless of how much influence you may have acquired for your Cardinal.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pocket Landship is a solo 9 card wargame set in a World War I-ish world. Command a landship (the original British term for tanks) to clear a sector of enemy infantry, artillery, and landships.&#10;&#10;The player chooses either side of the 3 player cards to create either a single high powered landship with a main cannon and side sponsons, or a lesser armed landship plus a corvette class landship or squad of shock troops.&#10;&#10;The player then chooses either side of each of the 6 enemy cards to create the enemy forces - a collection of enemy landships, artillery, infantry, and mine fields arranged in 2 rows of 3 cards.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the player will roll 3 6-sided dice and assign each die to each of their cards to attack the enemies.  Then, for the enemy turn, roll the 3 dice and assign them low to high left to right across the front enemy line, then take the assigned actions.&#10;&#10;Each card has its own damage track.  When a card is destroyed, it is removed from the game.  Win by destroying all 6 enemy cards.  Lose if the enemy destroys your landship.&#10;&#10;Cover art and card background images are public domain art from WWI artist Muirhead Bone.&#10;&#10;Pocket Landship was entered in BGG's 2017 9 Card Nanogame PnP Design Contest.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board for this game features several square-ish areas, which each have their own draw pile.  Players each sequentially pick the top card which has the action they'd like to take.  These actions revolve around placing of control markers on the board.  There are three types of control markers that are available, and each type of marker will score each time the area is scored.  The areas are scored when either the Ancestor or the Elder tokens appear in the area, and moving either of the tokens gives the moving player the first-player status or extra scoring cards.  The scoring cards are the last element, as once an area is scored the players involved in the area use these cards to manipulate control makers in the general vicinity.  Scattered throughout the decks are scorpion cards, which ages the game to completion and increases the value of the scorings through the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Pumafiosi (Puma Mafiosi) operate in a strict hierarchy from the family's boss down to the lowest Picciotti. Everyone wants to reach the top, and no one wants to end up at the bottom &mdash; or even beneath the soil. Amongst these aspiring Pumafiosi, it is wise to keep your head out of the firing line. Stand out too much, and you'll soon find yourself in prison, if not murdered by the rival families.&#10;&#10;Pumafiosi is a refreshingly unique blend of simple trick-taking and precarious press-your-luck. Each trick, the person who plays the second-highest card wins the round, and they decide where to place that winning card in the hierarchy. You can even choose to place your measly card at the top of the hierarchy to stake your claim on the big boss points. The catch is that these cards can be knocked down one or more steps on the hierarchy by higher-valued cards, and whoever owns a falling card is penalized!&#10;&#10;Pumafiosi differs from the older title Rooster Booster thanks to designer Reiner Knizia:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Increasing the strategy by narrowing the deck to a range of 1-55&#10;    Crafting a satisfying two-player experience&#10;    Raising the stakes by tweaking the hierarchy values and penalties&#10;    Tailoring a theme that gives context to the rules&#10;    Enhancing the drama by including physical penalty points&#10;    Layering decisions with further depth and tension via one-time-use items&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
