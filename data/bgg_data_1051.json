    "Description": "This is a mid-19th century party game subtitled I Hope I Don't Intrude, and takes its name from the popular comedy play Paul Pry, which premiered in 1825.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a deck of 13 cards. Once card has the instructions, and list of 12 questions labelled A through L. Each letter corresponds to an answer card with possible responses numbered from 1 through 15.&#10;&#10;One player has custody of the cards, and reads a question. The remaining players in turn pick a number from 1 to 15, and the player with the cards then reads off the corresponding answer.&#10;&#10;For instance, to question L (&quot;What most occupies your thoughts?&quot;), potential answers range from &quot;The fashions&quot; and &quot;My dinner&quot; to &quot;My own virtues&quot; and &quot;In building air castles&quot;. Presumably the answer generating the most laughs wins.&#10;&#10;",

If the players collectively complete the required pattern, everyone wins - if not, the group loses. Winners gain loot, the losers gain nothing - with the amount of loot determined by the number of cards matched. After 8 rounds, the winner is the player with the most loot.&#10;&#10;There's always a chance though that one player was the Snitch - trying to make the group fail in order to win by themselves! The Snitch causes others to miss out on the loot, and steals some of their existing loot. Being the snitch at the right time is key to winning the game!&#10;&#10;Players have a limited number of Snitch cards - when will you Snitch on your friends? When will they Snitch on you?! Everyone has to Snitch at some point...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tiberius Claudius Nero's father was lucky to escape execution by Octavian Caesar after the siege of Perusia in 40 BC. His parents took the infant Tiberius and fled from the blood-chilling vengeance of the future Emperor Augustus. As they made their perilous escape from Italy nobody gave a dried fig for the boy's prospects. So how could he possibly have become Augustus' heir and successor?&#10;&#10;It is 11BC and the succession plans of Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus have suffered a calamity: his trusted friend, son-in-law and Heir-apparent, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, has died suddenly. There is a vacuum into which several talented men wish to step. Although they don&rsquo;t yet know it, all of Augustus&rsquo;s male heirs are also destined to die before him, and the man who succeeds in replacing Agrippa at Augustus&rsquo;s right hand will ultimately become the Emperor of Rome, the most powerful man in the World.&#10;&#10;The players take the roles of real Roman Noblemen, each having recently finished a term as Consul of Rome. This, plus ambition, qualifies them for the most prestigious jobs in the service of Augustus and the Empire.&#10;&#10;Each of the 8 turns represents 3 years. In each turn Augustus asks the Nobles to do 6 jobs. The 6 jobs are depicted by Career Cards. The Nobles will use their influence with Augustus to get the first choice of the jobs. The jobs will help the Nobles in several areas that any Roman Noble must be seen to excel at, in order to rise above their fellows. They do this by placing cubes into the boxes of the main board as prescribed by the Career Cards. Those boxes include commanding Rome's Legions, Conquering new provinces, Governing the existing one, serving the gods of the State religion, helping Augustus in Rome, and hopefully being permitted to ride at Augustus' side through the Forum in a Triumph. Each Noble will try to marry into Augustus's family. And with the right collection of cubes a Noble can also be adopted as Augustus's Son.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each tile must be connected (diagonally or orthogonally) to the engine tile via coloured squares. If a player successfully connects 3 goal tiles with the engine tile so that goal tiles turn in the right direction, he scores 3 points for each. Each empty space on the board is worth -1 point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players must be careful, invalid connections might make whole sections of the board invalid and empty before the scoring. No two tiles may be connected via different colours, and a tile connected with two tiles that turn in two different directions is also invalid.&#10;&#10;A round lasts between 1 and 3 minutes (players choice, depends on skill). The player with the best score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Players may also choose to use or not use both sides of the gear tiles that easily show which gear turns in which direction. Using both sides makes the game much easier and it is recommended for the first games.&#10;&#10;",

Budget restraints, wild weather  and angry citizens all contribute to the city&rsquo;s decline. &#10;Oh and don't get me started on the 100 foot tall dinosaurs or flying saucers...&#10;&#10;The game takes place over 8 game days and players take the roles of city officials trying to protect the city from damage, rioting and disease.&#10;&#10;Players use their city budgets to put crews into the city blocks to counter the news events that bring further disaster and ruin to the streets.&#10;&#10;If you can survive to the end of your watch and have most of the city still up and running you win as a team. But lose too many city blocks or too many citizens to disease rioting or other dangers and you are fired and removed from office.&#10;&#10;Each Player has a set of budget dice and there are federal budget dice which are divided among players according to the needs of the city.&#10;&#10;Your budget can be assigned to actions to counter damage that takes place during the game. (Each round event cards dictate the headlines for that round and the damage that is caused). &#10;These actions could be to put out fires, heal the diseased, control unruly citizens repair infrastructure and reconnecting utilities. Be careful though you also need budget to move your work crews around the city.&#10;&#10;If any of these issues get out of control they can spread very quickly. Losing 3 city blocks or all of the damage counters of any type results in instant dismissal from the City Disaster council and disgrace for your team.&#10;&#10;Watch your HQ as well if that burns down or is damaged beyond repair the same result can take place.&#10;&#10;With 4 difficulty levels this game can be a light entertaining game right through to nearly impossible odds. This might seem repressive but beating the game on Expert level is a great boost.&#10; Solo play can be played in the normal way but the Solo story mode involves scenarios that build upon each other.&#10;&#10;",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;From the rear of the box:&#10;&#10;Howden, originally Heaffudene, grew at a crossing point (Bridgewater) along the Old Derwent (Hailgate) after Lake Humber had started to silt up.&#10;&#10;The town has a history that starts before the Domesday Book and has several royal connections, King Edgar gave his first wife Howden Manor, William the Conqueror gave the church (later developed into the Minster) to the Bishop of Durham and King John gave Howden the right to hold an annual horse fair.&#10;&#10;Howden was a coaching town and although it does not have a railway, it is the M62 that brings people here today.  AVisitor can enjoy the Georgian architecture around the Minster, shops and cafes around the Market Place, a community venue in the Shire Hall, a walk around the nature reserve of Howden Marsh or recreational time in The Ashes.&#10;&#10;Local firms have helped to bring Howden MONOPOLY to fruition to celebrate The Ashes 90th anniversary.

    "Description": "In the early morning&rsquo;s mist, the clatter of the tumbril&rsquo;s wheels on the cobblestone echo through the streets of Paris. It brings a gruesome feast -consumed in rhythmic chopping- the National Razor is the gluttonous ouroboros of the revolution. Over the paranoid whisperings in the breadlines, and plastered rumors on the broadsheets, you sense that the revolution hangs by a thread. Will you be able to draw it back from the abyss, or will the final thump on the scaffold see your head in a basket?&#10;&#10;Giving careful homage to the themes of the period, play one of six factions vying for dominance of revolutionary France. Each faction has eight historical leaders to choose from and five unique asymmetrical agendas to push though in an attempt to gain control of the revolution.&#10;&#10;The game includes mechanics to coerce obedience, punish betrayal, or cooperatively reach mutual goals- allowing players to pick a path forward that best suits them. Each agenda proposed comes with a pool of 'largess' for players to distribute to win support for their machinations. Conversely, successfully sending an opposing faction's leader 'to the Chop' gains them, in addition the points scored, the trophy of a head on a pike.&#10;&#10;National Razor is played in five rounds. Each round begins with players simultaneously selecting a leader for their faction and secretly choosing what their faction will focus on that round. All players then reveal their leaders, and the leader with the best rank becomes the First Citizen to begin the game play.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn they can play any number of follower cards, buy improvements and titles, but they must play one of their five Agenda cards.  Agendas come with a pool of Largess -follower cards- that the active player proposes to give to players if her Agenda passes. Players then simultaneously vote on the fate of the Agenda using  Yes and No cards and may add modifiers if they feel particularly strongly about the outcome.&#10;&#10;Player decisions also advance a token along the Terror Track. When a Terror hits, the game state changes in unforeseen ways that encourage and reward aggressive behavior. The most aggressive behavior being attempting to send an opposing faction leader 'to the Chop.' This is done by proving that your incriminating evidence is legit by naming what the faction's chosen focus for the round is (thereby showing you have successfully infiltrated their faction). If the opposing faction is able to show the named focus from their unselected pile, the Chop attempt fails. If the named focus is correct however, the opposing faction leader is removed from the game, the accuser gets the bounty listed on the deceased character's card, and gains a  trophy card showing a head on a pike to demonstrate how brutal their faction is.&#10;&#10;After all factions have taken a turn, the round is over. All players with leaders still alive reveal their chosen focus, gaining the special benefits they provide. If its the 5th round of the game, total VP's are added up, with the highest being  deemed the victor.&#10;&#10;",

You want to become the true abstractionist of this era. At the same time your limited resources and lack of supplies hinders your goal, your work and pursuit of fame and status.&#10;&#10;The goal is to make color placements and color combinations in such a way that you end up with the highest score in the end. Every color added to the canvas is a potential scoring opportunity that will move the scoretrack pawn one or several (1-4) steps. If at any point during the game a player reaches the score of twenty (20) points or above, the Endgame Exhibition is triggered and the final scoring begins.  Some color tile combinations scores extra during the scoring and you could score points for your chosen favorite color as long as no one else chosen the same.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Quest for El Dorado: Heroes &amp; Hexes includes three new double-sided terrain tiles that add a new element to the game: curses. When a player stops on a demon space, they must draw and reveal a curse token to see how they're affected. Maybe they have to discard certain cards before they can travel on a particular type of terrain, or perhaps other explorers will move while the cursed one is paralyzed, or maybe you'll be afflicted by a demon, specifically a demon card that's shuffled into your deck and does nothing but frustrate you or get transformed into a half-coin each time you see it.&#10;&#10;Why would you travel to a demonic location when bad things would happen to you? Moving to that space doesn't cost a card, so you might just be being cheap, but additionally some demon spaces have tunnels that allow you to move directly from one hex on a tile to another on that same tile. Is that free movement worth the punishment you might suffer? The expansion includes two blockades that bear a demon symbol, and if you're the first to break such a blockade on your quest across the map, you must suffer the curse that follows.&#10;&#10;To play with this expansion, you must use the &quot;Caves&quot; variant of The Quest for El Dorado base game in which mountains are loaded with cave tokens. This expansion includes new cave tokens to be mixed with those of the base game, as well as four new types of expedition cards (with three copies of each) that can be pulled into the market once a stall opens.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with one of four familiars (dealt out at random) in their deck, with each familiar having a repeating power and a one-shot bonus power. For a further way to juice up your deck, you can visit one of the three tavern spaces in the game. When you do this, you draw the top three hero cards of the ten-card deck, place one of those heroes in your hand (after which it becomes a regular part of your deck), then shuffle the other two heroes into the deck. Only one hero per adventuring party, please!&#10;&#10;The expansion includes six suggested map set-ups &mdash; all at medium or hard levels, and all with three new terrain tiles &mdash; as well as guidelines for how to create maps yourself.&#10;&#10;",

Some dice and eraserable pencils are required to play.&#10;&#10;On your turn, roll three dice. Each number is associated to a different material (1 = plastic, 2 = paper, 3 = glass, 4 = aluminuim, 5 = special stuff, 6 = organic waste), and each material has a different special effect.&#10;&#10;For each die you can choose either to keep it or discard it. In the latter case, you get to activate the related special effect - i.e.: paper makes you roll 2 more dice, while glass makes you adjust the value of another die,... - . Mark a X on the Waste track (negative points!) for each die discarded in this way.&#10;&#10;Then, for each die you kept, mark a X on the related &quot;building track&quot;. When the 5th X of a building track has been marked, you have managed to build the Recycling Plant for the related material, thus you won't mark X on the Waste track anymore for using the related special effect. You also score some points depending on how many other players have preceded you in building the same Recycling Plant.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has built 4 Recycling plants, the game is over and whoever has the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Features three game modes: Full Game, Solo, and Overtime.&#10;&#10;In Micro-Football, players take turns each quarter on offense and defense. The offense has the goal of reaching the Goal Line of the defense for a Touchdown, or get close enough for a Field Goal, while the defense has the goal of stopping them. Each player has seven cards to choose from (only four will be played), and as they are played simultaneously with your opponent, the results of the combined yardage moves the marker along the football field. If one player can consecutively guess their opponents' next card 3-times, they will trigger a Big Play like an automatic touchdown or a turnover. The player with the most points after four quarters wins!&#10;&#10;Components&#10;  - 18 cards (7 offense, 7 defense, 4 football field)&#10;  - 4 cubes (2 blue, 2 red) &#10;  - 1 coin&#10;  - 1 gem (football marker)&#10;  - rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Shane begins the game wounded, with 2 Survivor Cards in his discard pile and a hand of only 3 cards. However, Shane is hiding something from Rick: his Shotgun! The Shotgun Survivor Card is set aside and the player controlling Shane has a Map Card that only he or she can look at. If Shane ever gets to the secret Space indicated on the Map Card, he gets to add the Shotgun directly to his hand, swinging the odds wildly in his favor.&#10;&#10;But Rick has some advantages of his own in this one-on-one battle to the death! Rick starts the Scenario with more health and is considered the Leader during the entire Scenario (which may be one of the reasons Shane has such a problem with him!). Just like any regular Scenario of THE WALKING DEAD: NO SANCTUARY, the Leaders draws 2 Event Cards, choosing 1 card to become the Active Event and discarding the other card, causing a penalty for all players. The difference when playing PvP is that a character who is Defiant to the Approach set by the Active Event only hurts his own cause, since he is the only one who earns the resulting Stress.&#10;&#10;The Scenario ends when either Rick or Shane is killed by his opponent. However, since this is the world of The Walking Dead, when Shane is &ldquo;killed&rdquo; he rises again as a Walker one turn later, with the regular Shane figure replaced by the Walker Shane figure. The player controlling Shane will also have control of all the other Walkers on the board. Rick will need to put down his former friend a second time to win!&#10;&#10;",

Then, in clockwise order, each player will use either a card action and a standard action OR if you're willing to gamble a little of your gems, 2 standard actions. Standard actions allow the player to draw new Grifters or Lady Luck cards, or take income in the form of a gem from the bank. Card actions are found not only on the Grifters, but also the Lady Luck cards.&#10;&#10;Each player will have a hand that consists of three Lady Luck cards and 1 Grifter card. The grifter is 1 of 7 vile characters from across the universe that you will use to guide you, lie about, or pay to exchange. The Lady Luck cards are poker style cards with abilities of their own and if you're lucky, could win a poker game for you.&#10;&#10;Players are dismissed when they lose a challenge. Once dismissed, they may pay gems to challenge the dismissing player to a duel. If they challenge and win, they are back in the game. If they challenge and lose, they are eliminated. They play rounds equal to the number of players plus two OR until only one player remains. If they make it to the end, the active players play poker.&#10;&#10;Now, none of this truly matters to the criminals that wander into this saloon. LIE all you want. Just don't get caught! Or...get caught and challenge your accuser to a duel in the street to win your way back into the game and unlock an amazing Vengeance ability that could turn the tide of the game!&#10;&#10;So GAMBLE, CHEAT, DUEL, DISTRACT, or TELL THE TRUTH...Just WIN&#10;&#10;",

If playing Solo or Co-Op, share the inventory among all the members in your group. If playing competitively, each member attempts to climb the ranks on their own so each of them needs the inventory indicated.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS &amp; GENERAL FUNCTIONS&#10;&#10;1. MISSION CARDS&#10;The goal of the mission is stated on the Mission Card. Complete all the missions so that your secret society can grow.&#10;&#10;Types of missions:&#10;&#10;a) Score-Based Missions: reach a certain number of points before running out of 'Stache Cards.&#10;&#10;b) Architect Missions: replicate a certain design before running out of 'Stache Cards.&#10;&#10;c) Checklist Missions: complete the requirements on a checklist before running out of 'Stache Cards.&#10;&#10;2. TOP HAT CARDS&#10;Disguised with a Top Hat, you can infiltrate a new country by revealing what is known as a Top Hat Card.&#10;Top Hat Cards are divided into 9 squares (1 flag and 8 location squares). While you cannot place anything on a flag square, you are considered to have set up a bureau on the flag square the moment you gain access to that country. For this reason, flag squares will count toward completing Secret Agendas.&#10;&#10;3. 'STACHE CARDS&#10;Disguised with a 'Stache, you are able to set up bureaus across the world. Each 'Stache Card contains a location where you can potentially set up 1 bureau. To set up a bureau, you must discard the 'Stache Card and place your bureau on the proper tile.&#10;&#10;If you cannot or choose not to use a 'Stache Card to set up a bureau, hide the card in your Vault. Rest assure you'll be able to use it later to make investments.&#10;&#10;4. YOUR VAULT&#10;This is where ALL 'Stache Cards not used to place a bureau must go at the end of a round. On any later turn, you will be able to use the $ VALUE to make investments. A list of investments is found on the back of the Vault.&#10;&#10;5. BUREAUS&#10;These unmarked buildings are setup locations so that your secret society may operate in that country. Be careful when setting your bureau. Should it lead to exposure due to lack of stability, you'll lose this bureau and likely others as well.&#10;&#10;6. SECRET AGENDAS&#10;To accelerate your mission, try to complete Secret Agendas. Secret Agendas are patterns you'll want to achieve within any given country. These patterns are determined by the placement of the flag, the placement of bureaus, as well as the placement of decoys.&#10;&#10;Generally there is more than one way to complete a Secret Agenda and you can reveal all your options by rotating the card.&#10;&#10;Once you complete a Secret Agenda, you may choose to cover up your presence in that country and move onto the next. You can do this free of charge as long as the Secret Agenda has been achieved.&#10;&#10;The Cover Up consist of adding a new Top Hat Card ON TOP the components required to complete the Secret Agenda. As long as you successfully manage to do this, you will also Cover Up your completed Secret Agenda Card with a new Secret Agenda Card.&#10;&#10;7. TOP HATS&#10;A Top Hat is an opportunity to enter a new country without completing a Secret Agenda. You can gain a Top Hat by purchasing it from the 'Stache Cards in your Vault or you can also gain one by placing a Bureau on a tile with a Top Hat SYMBOL.&#10;&#10;When using a Top Hat, you can either&#10;a) cover up component(s) from an already existing tower and climb UP.&#10;b) start a new branch by adding a new Top Hat Card on the ground floor.&#10;&#10;8. DECOYS&#10;Decoys can be placed on the tile of your choice (except on a flag) without needing to play a 'Stache Card.&#10;&#10;You can gain a Decoy by purchasing it from the 'Stache Cards in your Vault or you can also gain one by placing a Bureau on a tile with a SUITCASE SYMBOL.&#10;&#10;Decoys count as a yellow square in terms of your Secret Agendas. They can also be used to provide stability in a country.&#10;&#10;9. BRIDGES&#10;Bridges, when required, merge together separate branches within your organization. The need for bridges is determine by your chosen Mission Card.&#10;&#10;There are no fees for placing a bridge(s). However, for a merger to be completed, you will need to cover the bridge(s) with a new Top Hat Card. Do this by using a Top Hat.&#10;&#10;10. CRISIS CARDS&#10;These cards are for competitive play only. They enable you to run an interference in another member's plans.&#10;&#10;Crisis Cards are purchased.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Change is not given.&#10;&#10;When a pair of the same gem is collected, it must be set down for all to see. A third of that gem may be added to make a trio. The diamond counts as a pair or trio by itself. Play moves clockwise. If the deck exhausts, reuse the discard pile.&#10;&#10;The first to get 3 pairs, or 2 trios, of gems, wins!&#10;&#10;",

Ghost cards are played on the last bomb placed on a house to remove it to the discard pile, and Vampire cards may be paired with a card to play an extra card of that type during a turn. A turn is over when no card can be played. If a player already has 5 cards at the start of a turn, draw 1 more card.

Telly Time comes in a small tuckbox, which contains 59 cards and 35 small plastic chips. Most of the cards are new TV shows.&#10;&#10;45 of the cards in Telly Time are brand new Shows. There are three new Genres represented:&#10;&#10;Chat Shows have a special power: the moment you Develop one, you may rotate all Stars and Ads in one of your timeslots (including the one the Chat Show is going in) to their good sides.&#10;&#10;Quiz Shows also have a special power: at the end of each Season, you may use any Quiz Shows active in your lineup to convert money into Viewers at a rate of $1M to 1 Viewer, up to $3M for 3 Viewers for each active Quiz Show in your lineup.&#10;&#10;Kids Shows have no special explicit powers, but tend to get you a lot of Viewers for their cost, and you can stuff them with Ads. But they only want to go on your earliest slot, with a big penalty if you put them on in the wrong time slot.&#10;&#10;Note that you must have The Networks base game in order to play Telly Time! The Networks: Telly Time is partially compatible with The Networks: On the Air. The designer doesn't recommend playing it with the Shows from On the Air, but it will work just fine with the Stars, Ads, and Network Cards from On the Air.&#10;&#10;The Networks: Telly Time is fully compatible with The Networks: Executives. Mogul Cards work the same way, except that you pick them up when you move the marker on your Genre-Bonus-O-Meter to the end.&#10;&#10;",

Prove that you are capable of attracting the most visitors to your zoo and you might just become the new director of Zooronga - the World&rsquo;s Greatest Zoo!&#10;&#10;Zooronga is a zoo-building, tile-laying game. Each player is a zookeeper with some money and a place to start. The game lasts for five months and each month 5 zoo-tiles are auctioned for the highest bidder. At the end of the month points are calculated. Each zoo-tile contains two animal enclosures of animals from different regions (eg. polar animals, African animals etc), some roads and possibly trees.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly selects the amount of money he is willing to pay for the tile and the highest bidder wins the auction. Whenever a tile is bought it needs to be added to your zoo so that the roads and green areas match. It might be that after the tile is added to your zoo, your zoo becomes more interesting than before. Interest value is shown with little stars on the tiles. The more stars of one color you have, the more interesting your zoo is for that region. Visitors are also interested in trees and parks. Visitors always go for the most interesting zoos and at the end of the month each visitor in your zoo gives you points. When the month ends, each player receives some income and new zoo-tiles are drawn for auction.&#10;&#10;The goal is to attract as many visitors to your zoo as possible and thus score more points than others.&#10;&#10;",

Obviously customers buy only products that are on their shopping list.&#10; Try to open your stalls in strategic position and keep an eye on price trends: the best selling goods will be more expensive in the next rounds. But stalls of a goods type can inflate that goods.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, beware of thieves, workers, policeman and many other characters that could benefit (or damage) your (or opponents) business: You have action disks that can be spent to pick-up and/or use special actions of such characters.&#10;&#10;Be careful to plan your actions in time, as the market is divided into phases, marked by the opening of increasingly modern stalls: during the game the old stalls will be scrapped.

As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France's borders. This was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King's ultimate aim this was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis' war of middle age - a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men.&#10;&#10;Spain, then ruled by the Bourbon kings' great rival, the House of Habsburg, joined the Grand Alliance, but she soon wished she had not. The Army of the Sun King was the premiere military machine of its age, the Spanish Army a fallen titan. Nevertheless, the Spanish saw the war through to its end. While her exhausted allies struck secret peace deals, Spain fought on. Only with the taking of Barcelona in 1697 did she sue for peace - and the decision to capitulate came from Madrid, not its garrison. Barcelona held for 63 days against a massive bombardment and multiple assaults that left 15,000 French dead on her glacis and in her shattered bastions. By the end, both sides were wondering if they would have the strength to fight another round.&#10;&#10;Catalonia was a secondary front. For much of the war the French fielded fewer men than the Spanish and were kept on a tight leash. The man in charge, Anne Jules de Noailles, II Duc de Noailles, was governor of Roussillon, formerly part of Catalonia. His Intendant, or 'commissar', was a Catalan. They hoped to harness one of the periodic peasant revolts that plagued the region and 'win hearts and minds' for France - or at least keep the Army of Spain dancing to their tune. Unfortunately, Noailles could not get his subordinates to buy into this program; the arrogance inherent in traditional military culture alienated the population and the French found themselves involved in a nasty guerrilla war. Only after Spain's allies began to withdraw from the struggle were the French able to bring overwhelming force to bear against her.&#10;&#10;In AOR, you will have a chance to change history - and even if you cannot, perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books.&#10;&#10;As the French, will you pursue a hearts and minds strategy, or try for all out conquest? Will you occupy territory or make surgical strikes aided by your fleet? (Be warned, the family that runs the Ministry of Marine is at odds with the family that runs the Ministry of War.) The French Army is state-of-the-art. You have more artillery, the latest equipment (bayonets instead of pikes), and access to an administrative machine capable of supporting nearly 500,000 men. But you command a secondary front. Versailles will forever be taking regiments away from you, forcing you to rely on local militia and even Catalan renegades. If you garrison every post, you will be too weak to go on the offensive. If you give up captured fortresses to concentrate, the local population will believe you are weak and rise against you. If you do nothing, you will lose the respect of the Sun King and the Court ladies.&#10;&#10;As the Spanish, can you keep the French at bay? Or can you damage them enough to try a counter-invasion of Roussillon? Will the English send their fleet and land troops to aid you? Or, will the Holy Roman Emperor divert his attention from the Turks long enough to spare you some Imperial regiments? The Spanish Army, led by a succession of viceroys who often found themselves more in conflict with the local Catalan government than with the French, is a motley collection of regular regiments (the tercios), decent cavalry, poorly motivated and equipped militia, and mercenaries. Spain's best assets are her guerrillas, the migueletes, assisted by vigilante bands known as somaten, and the mountainous Catalan terrain.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;1) Two map sections representing the northeast corner of Spain at one league (4 Km) per hex.&#10;&#10;2) 600 die cut counters representing the forces of the French and the Spanish and their allies. Scale is Battalion - that is, the playing pieces represent battalions and regiments.&#10;&#10;3) Rules, charts, tables, and display cards.&#10;&#10;4) An historical commentary.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Army of Italy (AOI) is the twelfth volume in the Lace Wars series and the second in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV. As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France's borders. This was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King's ultimate aim this was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis' war of middle age - a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men.&#10;&#10;The war opened in Germany, but the Habsburgs, France's Great Enemy, also owned, or had suzerainty over, much of northern Italy. Coalition forces in Italy were weak, the Habsburg Emperor more concerned with his ongoing war against the Turks. However, the French could not spare many regiments for a second front. But, in 1689, the Spanish Habsburgs also declared war on France, fearing for their lands in the Low Countries. Unfortunately, this put their northern Italian possession of Milan squarely in King Louis' sights. This was a place the French felt they could take, but they would have to be quick about it. There was one potential obstacle: the House of Savoy.&#10;&#10;Duke Victor II Amadeus was a French puppet. But, he was also a vassal of the Emperor. And, he coveted Milan for himself... The French planned to cross the Duke's lands, which straddled the western Alps, and launch their invasion of Milan from that state's borders. The mistake King Louis made was to assume Duke Victor would obey his will regardless of how he was treated. The arrogance of the French soldiers and their king combined with Duke Victor's self interest and Coalition gold to push him into the Allied camp. He refused access to the French and found himself at war with them. The Duke was a complex character. Young and valiant, he desired glory over the French in battle, but soon found himself outmatched while his allies proved unreliable. Yet at the same time, he understood how to dissemble and manipulate. What he could not achieve on the battlefield he accomplished in a backroom deal that bought him not only a separate peace with France in 1696, but command over the very French army he had been fighting for the past six years! It was he who led the invasion of Milan!&#10;&#10;The war in Italy typified military campaigning in this period. Thwarted in their plans to invade Milan from Piedmont, the French attacked Duke Victor, spilling out of the alpine passes and across Piedmont. But, they could not establish a permanent base and had to withdraw. This flow and ebb was a feature of the early years. Sieges and battles were fought but none brought a lasting advantage to either side. In 1692 the Coalition in turn invaded France but found themselves plagued by the same problems that had beset the French. By 1694 the situation was deadlocked, both militarily and politically. However, on the political front, Duke Victor and King Louis were gradually approaching an accommodation. In 1695 the Sun King at last made some hard concessions. The following year Europe was shocked to learn Duke Victor had changed sides. His defection began the rush to peace, as the Powers tried to obtain the best deal possible for themselves.&#10;&#10;In Army of Italy, you will have a chance to change history - and even if you cannot, perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books.&#10;&#10;As the French, will you steamroller your ungrateful puppet state or simply make life so uncomfortable that she decides to join you after all? Then, the invasion of Milan can begin. The French Army is state-of-the-art. You have more artillery, the latest equipment (bayonets instead of pikes), and access to an administrative machine capable of supporting nearly 500,000 men. But you command a secondary front. Versailles will forever be taking regiments away from you, forcing you to rely on your wits. If you garrison every post, you will be too weak to go on the offensive. If you do nothing, you will lose the respect of the Sun King and the Court ladies.&#10;&#10;As the Coalition, can you keep the French at bay? Or can you damage them enough to try a counter-invasion of France? Will the English send their fleet and land troops to aid you? Or, will the Holy Roman Emperor divert his attention from the Turks long enough to spare you some Imperial regiments. Duke Victor is not to be trusted. His actions belie his noble declarations. If you are not careful, the House of Savoy may surrender or even switch sides...&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1) Five map sections representing the region of the Maritime Alps and the upper Po Valley at one league (4 Km) per hex. The fifth map shows the main area of conflict, allowing players to dispense with some of the maps for most scenarios, in case space is at a premium.&#10;&#10;2) 840 die cut counters representing the forces of the French and their opponents - Savoyards, Huguenots, Waldensians, Spanish, Austrian, and German. Scale is Battalion - that is, the playing pieces represent battalions and regiments.&#10;&#10;3) Rules, charts, tables, and display cards.&#10;&#10;4) An historical commentary.&#10;&#10;",

The accurate elements of all the units, the unique tactics, the high level strategy &amp; the ability to create a unique conflict in every start of a new game round, are growing the most, in both playability &amp; enjoyment of the game, for both 2 and 4 players.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;The game can be played either with 1 vs 1 or 2 vs 2 as pairs.&#10;Each player or pair, takes the role of either the German Army or the Soviet Army.&#10;&#10;The game has a damage point system to figure the winner. The first player who reaches 20 points (40 points for 4 players) on board meter, will be the winner of the battle. Damage points are equal to life points (red cross with specific number in each card).&#10;&#10;Every card has 7 different sectors (boxes):&#10;&#10;Upper: from left to right :&#10;First box - Velocity of weapon&#10;Second box -  Weapon's Penetration level &#10;Third box - Own armor level&#10;Fourth box - Own life points&#10;&#10;Lower:&#10;First box - movement &#10;Middle Double number target - 2 x 12sided dice (black for German/White for Soviet), both numbers in dice is the damage area for the weapon. A 10 on the dice is a Critical hit &amp; any unit who receives this damage must be removed from the battle ground.&#10;Finally, the blue pointer with the specific number is the encounter points needed for this unit to use it in the deployment phase of the battle.&#10;&#10;Each turn:&#10;1. Encounter points (both armies start with 5 each)&#10;2. Draw phase - each player draws 2 cards&#10;3. Move phase - each player can move their units&#10;4. Deployment phase - each player can deploy any unit if he has the necessary encounter points&#10;5. Engagement phase - each player can attack the enemy player based on the abilities of their units&#10;6. Discard phase&#10;7. End of turn&#10;&#10;Before the first turn all players must draw 5 cards each and receives 5 encounter tokens. There is a 7 card hand limit. Some cards can give the player the ability to draw a general commander&#10;card from their own general deck.&#10;&#10;There can be no more than 2 generals active during the battle, but a player can change a general card by discarding the old one and playing a new one.&#10;&#10;Each general gives 1 additional encounter points in the beginning of each turn. Also, each player receives 1 encounter point every turn and 1 additional point for every unit deployed in the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Players can combine cards if it is allowed in the card's description but only until the end of the turn (except the end of battle for some cards)&#10;&#10;Air units are visible during the battle and while performing an attack. If enemy anti-aircraft wapons are available, they must be countered&#10;&#10;Units with low penetration levels cannot attach enemy units with higher armor level.&#10;&#10;Special cards can give the player's units unique abilities during each battle.&#10;&#10;First player who reach 20/40 points will be the winner of the battle &amp; the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As in classical chess, the object of Tensor Chess is to checkmate the opponent's king.&#10;&#10;The game is played on an 8X10 board with a new piece added to the array; the Tensor Beast.&#10;&#10;The Beast Manuevers dependent on interacting with the new piece.  The beast can move one square in any direction like the king.&#10;&#10;The beast can also leap forward or backward over its own or opposing pieces and land on the next square if that square is unoccupied. It can leap diagonally, or leap horizontally along a row (rank) and vertically along a column (file). The beast can hop both vertically and horizontally on the same turn, but horizontal and vertical leaping cannot be combined with diagonal leaping.&#10;&#10;The beast cannot move one square and then begin leaping. Nor can it leap and simply return to its starting square as this would be skipping a turn. It can, however, return to its starting square on the same turn if it captures an opposing beast by its final leap.&#10;&#10;The beast can only capture an opposing beast and can only be captured by an opposing beast. A beast captures an enemy beast by hopping over it rather than landing on the same square.&#10;&#10;For example, a beast may hop over an enemy beast, not capture it, and proceed to hop over and capture another beast.&#10;&#10;Or a beast may hop over an opposing beast, and not capture it on that first hop, but then hop back over the opposing beast (moving in the other direction) and capture it on that hop, all on the same turn.&#10;&#10;In addition A bishop, rook or queen can pass through a beast of its own color, but not through an enemy beast.&#10;&#10;A beast acts as a shield for its own pieces and blocks opposing pieces.&#10;&#10;A pass through may involve more than one beast.&#10;&#10;A king may pass through only when castling.&#10;&#10;Similarly there are unique ricocheting and propelling moves associated with the Beast.&#10;&#10;A beast may pass through another beast when propelled.&#10;&#10;A pawn may pass through only on its first move and only when moving forward to an unoccupied square.  Pawns cannot pass though and capture.&#10;&#10;",

When all badges and treats have been knocked off the carousel the players add up their points and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;(Game play is similar in style to Hungry Hungry Hippos.)&#10;&#10;From the website:&#10;&#10;Paw Patrol is on a roll!&#10;&#10;Spring into action with the Paw Patrol Pups In Training Game! Your mission is to collect as many treats and badges as you can from the spinning target ring. Set up is easy, just place the treats and badges on the target ring and give it a spin. Then get behind your favorite Paw Patrol Character and press the Pup Flipper.&#10;&#10;When you knock off a badge or treat hold on to it, each one is worth points. The player with the most points at the end wins!&#10;&#10;(No batteries required.)&#10;&#10;",

For your second purchase, you can buy a tile from the dolmen board. These &quot;druid&quot; tiles are normal landscape tiles, except that they will often bear a stone tablet or a scroll. Stone tablets grant special powers that you can use until the end of the game, while scrolls are subject to the usual rules of the base game.&#10;&#10;New scoring tiles offer further variability.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is assigned a color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) and given their color player cubes, 5 to each player. Cubes are all pink except the underside which has a hidden player color. Each color is given a value card facedown to dictate what each color cube is worth.&#10;&#10;For example: If the blue player has a 1 on their value card, then the cubes that have blue on their hidden underside are each only worth 1.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing action cards to best their opposition. Action cards are used to steal, swap, and flip cubes over to reveal the underside. Action cards also can be used to look at other players value cards, flip over value cards for everyone to see, or even to change a value card. The player with the highest value of cubes at the end of the round wins the game!&#10;&#10;Cube Hog can be played in two ways. Quickplay is the fastest way to pick up and play. Quickplay games last about 10 minutes and a great for some quick fun. Competitive play consists of multiple games of Cube Hog with each game won rewards the player with a Gold Cube. Playing this takes about 45 minutes. This also adds the 'Gold Cube' card into the deck to add a new mechanic specifically designed for competitive play. First player to win 3 gold cubes wins the competitive play game!&#10;&#10;Cube Hog rewards players who can remember which cube is which while the cubes slowly get shuffled around the table. However, players are also rewarded when they use sleight of hand to shuffle their own cubes to fool other players.&#10;&#10;",

One player at the table has a secret, and it's about them. They've even written in down and placed it in a secret envelope on the table. Do you want to read it? WIN THE GAME. The secret can never be shared, or be repeated. That's because it's written on EDIBLE PAPER with a FOOD COLORING MARKER, and it must be EATEN to make sure the secret DIES with the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;Each player (including the player whose secret is in the game) has one six sided die and a mini coffin. Players use their coffins to hide a secret die number they've chosen, trying to be the highest or lowest unique number. That's right, no rolling of these dice. Players can choose any number from one to six. Everyone opens their coffin at the same time to see who wins each round. Choose wisely, or your number might get cancelled out!&#10;&#10;Each round there are TWO winners! One winner draws a card. The other moves their token. Players try to collect a set of four cards to form the phrase: IT - DIES - WITH - ME. OR, move their token across the six grave tiles, all the way to the SECRET ENVELOPE. Complete just one of these goals, and you win. You get to READ THE SECRET! Just remember, that secret must die with you.&#10;&#10;",

Equipped with advanced ailerons for precise atmospheric maneuvering, thick armor plating, powerful laser cannons, and the capacity to carry elite infantry, this menacing vessel struck fear into Rebel forces across the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Any TIE reaper that you choose to fly in your squadron packs a potent strike, rolling three attack dice as its primary weapon attack. A TIE reaper is not especially agile, leaving it with only a single defense die, but with six hull and two shields, these starships are durable enough to stick around on the battlefield. In fact, TIE reapers bring something quite special to your Imperial X-Wing squadrons. This ship bears the unusual jam action that lets you jam nearby ships and prevent them from using a focus, evade, or target lock&mdash;opening a wealth of tactical opportunities when you&rsquo;re building your squad or flying into battle.&#10;&#10;In the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game &ndash; TIE Reaper Expansion Pack, you'll find the pre-painted TIE reaper miniature, four different ship cards, eleven upgrade cards, a maneuver dial, and all the other tokens that you need to bring the Empire's deadliest troopers into the heat of battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Rather than introducing completely new ships to the game, this expansion follows in the vein of the Rebel Aces Expansion Pack and the Heroes of the Resistance Expansion Pack by introducing new versions of existing ships already in the service of the Rebel Alliance. In this case, you'll find two new ship miniatures: a U-wing and a T-65 X-wing, both pre-painted in the stunning red-and-white paint scheme of Saw Gerrera's freedom fighters.&#10;&#10;Though the ships may be functionally the same as the ones included in previous expansions, the Saw's Renegades Expansion Pack offers an assortment of ship cards featuring pilots from Saw's motley band of warriors &mdash; or even Saw Gerrera himself, flying his powerful U-wing into your battles. Along with new ship cards for both the T-65 X-wing and the U-wing, you'll find an arsenal of fifteen new upgrade cards, equipping your squadrons with any number of unusual tactics or system upgrades.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The quickest player to grow and collect everything that's needed, according to the goal card, wins a victory crystal.&#10;&#10;When the players are already good in playing with basic rules, they can try to make the game more complex, by adding some extra rules. In addition to arms and tentacles, the players have to collect a certain amount of seashells on the card of their alien. Note that if some player stops the round by saying &quot;I'm ready!&quot;, and it turns out that the task is made incorrectly, then the player loses one victory crystal! The first player who receives 5 victory crystals wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
