Different sized pieces are worth a certain amount of points each. Point penalties are incurred if the bar moves. The player who has accumulated the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Game ends when the number of pieces left in the board equal the number of players.&#10;&#10;",

Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc.  Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible.  When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.&#10;&#10;The traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.&#10;&#10;There are four basic scoring difference between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee.  They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.&#10;&#10;Travel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within compartments of a plastic box and allows players to &quot;lock&quot; a particular die between rolls.&#10;&#10;",

It is the sequel to the acclaimed and successful &quot;King of 12&quot;, Unlike its sister game, Council of 12 is completely cooperative with an adjustable level of difficulty. Here, the aim is to communally manipulate the central d12 according to the requirements of the cards at hand. Council of 12 is completely self-contained, but builds on the popular core elements of King of 12. Characters are played and negated again and dice are manipulated.&#10;&#10;The game includes many different challenges to overcome, as well as an ever-changing selection of characters who will help you do so. Either let chance decide the composition of the Challenge deck, or else tailor it to your desired level of difficulty in your quest for the ultimate high score.&#10;&#10;Cooperative: You play your cards face-down. If you manage to correctly guess what cards your team mates will play, this will help you greatly when solving the puzzle posed by the challenge at hand. But even if things don't go as planned, you will often still have a chance to master the challenge &ndash; provided you manage to spot it!&#10;&#10;If you survive 7 challenges can you face your final task - securing the line of succession by forging an agreement among all the players.&#10;&#10;",

Players take three cards in hand, then all try to play cards to the center of the table, starting with 1s, then 2s, etc. The number of card piles in play can't exceed the number of players. When playing a card, a player can lay down a card that's one higher or one lower than the top card on a pile. As soon as a player lays down a 5, she claims the pile, placing it in her score pile. Players can discard cards as they like, but they lose 1 point for each card discarded.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player runs out of cards, she can end the round. Everyone scores 1 point for each card in their individual score pile, then loses 1 point for each card discarded, each card in hand, and each card still in their pile. Players then sort the cards and start a new round. When one player has totaled 100 or more points, she wins!&#10;&#10;",

As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.&#10;&#10;The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.&#10;&#10;Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).&#10;&#10;You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.&#10;&#10;From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.&#10;&#10;Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a &quot;Beginning&quot; version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the &quot;Intermediate&quot; game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the &quot;Expert&quot; game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;2-piece fold-out game board&#10;Foreign Exchange Worksheet pad&#10;Net Worth Worksheet pad&#10;Hedging Cost Worksheet pad&#10;24 City Cards&#10;4 Borrowing Cost cards&#10;16 Currency Exchange cards&#10;16 Risk cards&#10;5 player tokens&#10;40 colored markers for 4 different colors&#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;",

There are some safe spaces on the board (maintenance sheds) that allow you to refresh your hand of cards as a bonus. Cards allow you to move, move faster along the road, escape a dinosaur or cancel another player's card. On your turn, you roll dice that indicate which dinosaur you may move. You then move yourself one space, play a card or trade in cards. The dinosaurs don't kill anyone (unlike in the movie!) -- they just pin you down until the dinosaur is moved away or an escape card is played.&#10;&#10;Although the box says 2-4 players, there are pieces for up to 8, which leads to a lot more mayhem (but a longer game).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Boardgamenews.com's Eric Martin:&#10;&#10;Covert Action, which handles 4-18 players, is aimed squarely at the Werewolf crowd. Players are part of a covert team (red, blue, green) that must eliminate one member of an opposing team, but your target is a mystery. At the start of the round, players are randomly dealt a card that depicts one of four characters: sniper, agent, cleaner, mole. The sniper of one team must shoot the sniper of another team to win that round. Problem is, you have to figure out who to shoot without being shot yourself.&#10;&#10;As for the other characters, the mole is secretly working for one of the other teams, the agent makes the other team lose if he is shot, and the cleaner must make the shot if the sniper isn&rsquo;t a part of the team. (Two cards are randomly thrown out each round, so a team&rsquo;s sniper might be out of play. The cleaner needs to figure this out by talking with his teammates, but since all discussion is open, they still need to be covert in their talk.) Members of the winning team (or teams, when three teams are in play) receive a score card, and the first player (or players) to receive four cards wins the game. Teams are randomly determined each round, so your back-up man one round may be your target the next. Covert Action sounds utterly simple, yet is difficult to describe succinctly. I look forward to seeing how Frank makes everything clear in the rules.&#10;&#10;",

You do this until either your or your opponent's Pogs have all been flipped over.  There are variations to the rules, but these are the basics of it.&#10;&#10;The game is simple and rather fun.  POG The Game is a nice packaging of the game, with all the components needed to play it according to World POG Federation rules and with their official merchandise.&#10;&#10;",

Three fields start with tulips on them. On a turn, you roll four dice up to three times, keeping or re-rolling dice as you wish. After your third roll, you can flip two tulip tiles in your field face down to have a fourth roll; you can do this again for a fifth roll if you wish, but you can't get a sixth roll and those tiles will be face down for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;If the dice show an arrangement depicted on your board, you can cover that field with a tulip tile; if not, take a tulip tile and place it next to your board; you can flip this tile face down on a later turn as part of a re-roll, but it has no other benefit.&#10;&#10;If you have a vertical column of three tiles or a diagonal line of three tiles that reaches down to the third row, then you can roll five dice on your turn. When you have a vertical or diagonal line that reaches the fourth or fifth row, then you'll roll six or seven dice on a turn. If you have a 2x3 or 3x2 arrangement of tiles on your board, you can place a bonus tile to cover them, and at the start of each turn, you can place one of the dice that you would roll on this tile with the number of your choice.&#10;&#10;Whoever first covers all seven fields in the fourth row or three adjacent fields in the fifth row or any four fields in the fifth row wins.&#10;&#10;Tulpenfieber includes a solo mode in which you play three rounds of the game, with a round ending only when you meet a victory condition. You gain a permanent tile on the board after rounds one and two to help you advance more quickly, but your final score in the solo game is the sum of all the tiles that you gained over three rounds, with a lower score being better. A score of 60 or lower counts as a win.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to complete the Temple and play Filling of the Holy of Holies is the winner. However, the game is not that simple. While you are trying to build the Temple, the Israelites continue to fall into Sin. Work must be stopped on the Temple in order to lead the Israelites back into the ways of the LORD. To make matters worse, invasion forces from Babylon are pouring down from the north. They want to destroy the entire city of Jerusalem and wreck the Temple! Do you have what it takes to handle the Israelites' rebellion against God, deal with the Babylonian attacks, and still find time to complete the Temple before your opponent does?&quot;&#10;&#10;Each of the two players takes the part of the Israelites attempting to complete the Temple while at the same time playing the part of the attacking Babylonians for his opponent. The goal of the game is to be the first player to complete the Temple in its entirety, including all Structure and Furnishing Cards, and finally play the Filling of the Holy of Holies card.&#10;&#10;The folding game board loosely depicts the Old City of Jerusalem. Positions for Structure, Priest, Altar, Prophet, other cards, and positions for the Babylonian army pawns are clearly marked.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of 100 cards from which he draws during the game. Drawing and laying cards are the driving force behind play. Cards are played to build the Temple structure, furnish the Temple, build an Altar, attack your opponent's Temple with Babylonian armies, destroy your opponent's armies, interfere with building using Sin, negating Sin with Burnt Offerings and Scapegoats, and so forth.&#10;&#10;A lengthy note from the designer explains much of the history and background of the game design and origin.&#10;&#10;",

Since its launch in March 2023, this remake, which includes all new text and designs intended for the American and European markets, has seen the release of three card sets: Dawn of History, False Gods, and Aquatic Invaders. In July of 2023, the first Battle Spirits Saga Pro Tour event was held, and next year competitors from around the world will be gathering at the World Championship, which is scheduled to take place in January 2024.&#10;&#10;The World Within&#10;&#10;The world of Battle Spirits Saga is made up of six separate realms, each with its own unique color. Red, the Realm of Flame, is a land of plentiful volcanoes and has dragons soaring overhead. Purple, the Realm of Gloom, is inhabited by demons and undead, which lurk among the numerous gravestones. Yellow, the Realm of Radiance, appears as an earthly paradise for the many cute creatures who frolic about under the watchful eye of beautiful angels. White, the Realm of Frost, is where the mechanized denizens traverse back and forth across vast, snowy plains. Green, the Realm of Forest, has an overabundance of birds and giant beasts, which live within its lush forests. And finally, blue, the Realm of Water, provides a home to rowdy buccaneers who spend their days brawling in its many seaports.&#10;Despite all of their uniquely distinctive cultures and ideals, the birth of a unified empire managed to bring about an uneasy yet long-lasting harmony among these six otherwise unstable realms&mdash;until the day when mysterious bodies of energy known as soul cores began raining down from the heavens, marking the arrival of an entirely new era filled with chaos. Influential powers took advantage of the opportunities this chaos created, dividing and conquering the realms, and an even greater threat awoke from its sealed slumber to spread further disaster.&#10;The Starhavoc Age, named after those initial catastrophic rains, begins its story in Dawn of History, then continues on with False Gods and Aquatic Invaders, and finally arrives at its conclusion in this fourth booster set, Savior of Chaos.&#10;Siegwurm Nova returns to the battlefield in a new form that is nearly unrecognizable. Missing in action since the Realm of Gloom invaded, this hero from the Realm of Flame has come back to bring an end to the chaos. His unwavering spirit of generosity and the anger he feels toward those less scrupulous individuals meddling in world affairs is reflected in his card effects, which are sure to leave a lasting impression.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;A unique feature of Battle Spirits Saga is the core system that helps define its gameplay. Originally devised by Micheal Elliott, this system augments the cards used in the game with chips, which are referred to as cores. Players use the cores in their possession to pay card costs, which are printed on each of the cards they intend to play.&#10;There are three types of cards in Battle Spirits Saga: spirits, which you summon onto the field and then attack your enemy with; nexuses, which will improve your chances in battle when placed onto the field; and single-use magic cards, which possess powerful effects that will punish your opponent. You can reduce the cost of playing spirits and nexuses when you play more of them with the same color, and once they are on the field, placing cores onto these cards will raise their level, which increases attack strength and enables more powerful effects.&#10;In Battle Spirits Saga, games are generally won by repeatedly attacking your opponent with spirits until their life is reduced to zero. Both players maintain their lives with cores, and when that life is lost, those cores immediately turn into an exploitable resource. How effectively you manage the cores in your possession will end up being the key to winning or losing games.&#10;&#10;",

The first card given is the starting city of the player, the other are the cities he must visit on his journey but in order of his liking.&#10;The game is then dice throwing to travel your route as fast as possible. There are different forms of transportation on the map and you can only use one form at a throw.&#10;&#10;The game has also a set of card representing &quot;cables&quot; which can be used for variation.

You pull back the knob and when you let it go the marble flies up a slight incline on your track and then rolls back down on one of the four lanes on the other side of the track.  The marble will push one of your plastic cars towards the finish line.

    "Description": "Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.&#10;&#10;In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.&#10;&#10;The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).&#10;&#10;The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on the fantasy Xanth novels by Piers Anthony.&#10;&#10;From the box: On Xanth... Anyone who doesn't believe in magic must reckon with the rainbow, which shows up only at a distance and retreats if anyone walks toward it. If one person stands still and another walks, the rainbow remains in place for the one and retreats for the other - simultaneously. It is one-sided, like a one-way path, invisible from the other side. That is obviously magic. - Piers Anthony&#10;&#10;Xanth, the magical, pun-filled world of Piers Anthony's fantasy novels, comes to life in this hilarious game. As one of many colorful characters, players must travel across land and sea in order to fulfill their wild and wacky quests. For 1 to 6 players, ages 12 to adult.&#10;&#10;Contents: 162 playing cards, 15 dice, 6 pawns, 12 chits, gameboard, rulebook, sorting tray.&#10;&#10;There are 3 card types used in the game, Chair Actors (Characters), Events/Encounters &amp; Quests. The majority are E/E cards. Only Character cards have colour illustrations, the others being monochrome or text only. A small errata sheet is included.&#10;&#10;Simple &amp; Easy Game&#10;Each player starts with 2 character cards and a Quest card (which determines their starting area on the map), with the character's Cunning &amp; Strength, plus a Talent - an extra rule or exception they can use, tying in to the character in the novels. &#10;Each turn starts by drawing an Event/Encounter card, playing it if it's a Disaster. Other E/E cards include objects to assist in some way, commonly in combat, hazards to play on other players, additional characters (mixed in from those not in play) etc., often limited by area (you have to get to some areas to activate some objects, for instance). &#10;If there is no Disaster, players move their pawn across the board (normally 2 areas, Characters, Event cards &amp; the area characteristics can modify this). The other players may then play Events or Creatures on them, possibly limited by the area. Characters can attempt to avoid encounters (roll dice under Cunning), or may fight (roll a die under Strength to cause a wound, repeat until one side loses). The specific encounter or creature may modify this, as can many E/E cards. &#10;Players start from scratch if their character is beaten, but can heal by use of certain cards or in certain areas. &#10;The first to complete their Quest wins.&#10;&#10;Still Simple &amp; Easy but Longer Game&#10;Same as before, but complete 2 or 3 Quests. This ties in to the 3 Quests set by the Magician Humphrey in the novels.&#10;&#10;Monaural (Solo) Game&#10;Same again, but work through the Quests deck until you are knocked out. hazards are drawn randomly instead of played by other players.&#10;&#10;Stereo (2-player) Game&#10;Same as the Monaural Game, the winner is the player who completes most Quests&#10;&#10;",

It was him, who spread disaster and there was no-one who did not bear wickedness in his heart. Only the First Hero, shielded by an armor, which defended him from the influence of sin, has challenged the Unnamed, defeated him and banished into the Void, which he close using magical seals.&#10;&#10;Today the safeguards crumble, and the power of the Unnamed makes its way to our world. Again, people act against each other, their hearts bearing the seeds of wickedness. The Virtues that were our strength are transforming into parodies of themselves. If the heroes will not complete the armor of the First, clothe with it the most worthy of them, and achieve victory over the Unnamed, all shall be lost.&#10;&#10;7 is a fantasy board game, in which you will become a hero worthy of legends, gathering his own party of adventurers to win over an ancient evil. You will take part in dangerous quests, working with other heroes to recover the miraculous Armor of Virtues and proving that you are the most worthy of wearing it. You shall accomplish great deeds, as long as you guard yourself from the temptation of excess, which brings with it sin and disaster.&#10;&#10;7 offers a unique mechanism of play, joining the aspect of cooperation with an element of rivalry. For the kingdom to survive, you will have to join your forces with other players. Be wary though, as there can be only one victor. You will have to beware of excessive ambition though, as it can unnoticeably cause your strength to falter. 7 opens the gates to a heroic, but dangerous adventure.&#10;&#10;",

But as with all haunted houses, know that you enter at your own risk. The goal is to emerge with your sanity - and your soul &ndash; intact.&#10;&#10;The board game remains true to the original award winning computer game, although now you play the role of one of the six guests in direct competition with the other guests. Starting from the Foyer, you are randomly assigned destination rooms to which you must go, by roll of the Magic Die, and there, solve the mysteries and challenges within. Be the first to finish your tour of the mansion, arrive at the final destination, the Little Room at the Top, solve the final puzzle there, and you best your fellow guests and achieve your heart's most secret desire. Which, for one thing, is to best your fellow guests.&#10;&#10;The puzzle types range from logic puzzles, to spatial problems, to riddles and cryptic clues to trivia. You never know what you'll get. Some may be easy, but some may be real brain freezers. But Stauf, being a fair-minded host, has provided up to three hints for the more difficult problems. But using the hints comes at a price, naturally. Nothing is free, you know. And in Stauf's world, no good deed goes unpunished.&#10;&#10;(Note that whereas The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour had a little less than 90 logic puzzles &amp; brain teasers between them, the basic tabletop game comes with 300, and that's just for starters.)&#10;&#10;And if you can't solve the puzzle put to you, the other guests will have a chance to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; it from you by answering it instead. So be vigilant and pay attention to not only your own puzzles, but to the puzzles put to your fellow guests. You might just walk away with the prize that was once within their grasp. How delicious is that?&#10;&#10;It all sounds pretty simple and straightforward, doesn't it? Well, not quite so fast. Simple, maybe. But straightforward? That's not exactly the way of the diabolical game maker, who here, has devised a number of Mystery Spells that are cast upon his guests, making things just a little trickier... and lot more interesting. Should you land on a Mystery space, you might be sent someplace you don't want to be. Or, you might be assigned extra rooms to unlock. Or, somebody might gain the power to &ldquo;Steal&rdquo; the answer to your puzzle from right under your nose. Again, you never know what you're going to get. But Stauf is,if nothing else, an equal opportunity evil doer... so all those bad things that can be inflicted on you can be inflicted on your opponents too. And take heart... for every evil spell, there is a good one too. Stauf isn't totally evil. Right?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is similar to &quot;Can't Stop&quot; whereby you try to push your luck as far as possible.  Basically, everybody is given a number (1-6) [assume you are &quot;3&quot;].  In your turn you roll the five dice.  If you get your number [for example there is one &quot;3&quot; in the five dice], you are given tokens for every die of your number [one token in the case] and the option to re-roll those dice which are not your number [in the case, the other four dice].  If you choose to re-roll them, you need to get more dice of your number to get more tokens [for example if you get another &quot;3&quot; from the four dice in the re-roll, you get another token].  If not [in this case if you did not get any &quot;3&quot; from the re-roll], you forfeit the tokens you get from your previous rolls [which is the one token}.    With enough tokens you get to the &quot;Pit&quot;.  This is when the fun begins, instead of rolling the dice for your number, you roll other people's numbers of your choice.  You get to remove their tokens instead.  If you are out of the &quot;Pit&quot;, you cannot do so.  Games goes on till last man standing.&#10;&#10;",

The players begin the game from their own base and each have control over a Vlad hero as well as an Archer and a Wallachian Knight.&#10;&#10;During the game, they try to eliminate the opposing Vlad heroes through tactical movements and attacks with their own units. Gameplay takes place on two boards: the Game Map and the Underworld Map. While the Game Map is the board on which all the interactions between players take place (including movement, battles, tactical actions, and the positioning of units and outposts), the Underworld is the area Archers and Wallachian Knights enter once they die in battle. I Am Vlad: Prince Of Wallachia has two types of battles: against enemy units and against neutral units; for both types, players use battle cards, magic cards, tokens, and an eight-sided die. Other tactical actions are made through tokens, gold coins, outposts, and so on.&#10;&#10;",

The trick is to make the best 5-dice &quot;hand&quot; from your two personal pocket dice and 5 up-for-grabs dice. Each roll could shift your strategy: will two pair become three of a kind or a full house? Will you go for broke with an all-in-bet?&#10;&#10;At showdown time, the player with the best poker hand wins the chips. The ultimate hand is a Yahtzee flush: 5-of-a-kind in the same color &quot;suit&quot;!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player blind draws two dice from the bag and places them in his cup and shakes (his secret &quot;pocket&quot; dice), and they ante and bet based on their pocket dice. Then three more &quot;community&quot; dice are drawn and rolled (the &quot;flop&quot;), then a fourth (the &quot;turn&quot;), and a fifth (the &quot;river&quot;), with two betting rounds (of check, bet, call, call &amp; raise, fold, and all-in options) in between each draw. Dice combinations are similar to their poker counterparts and can give players; two pair, three of a kind, full house, straight, four of a kind, flush, Yahtzee (five dice of the same number in different suits), straight flush, and the &quot;Yahtzee Flush&quot; - five dice of the same number and suit (color), that automatically wins a player the game.&#10;&#10;",
