Each set of dice and tokens should be in a unique color.  A set of Tenzi dice and some tiddlywinks should do the job.&#10;&#10;Setup:  Shuffle the cards and flip one to the dice side, and the other two to the event side.  Place them in a column with the dice on top 10 events showing below.  Choose a player to start.&#10;&#10;Choose an event:  The starting player (or the winner of the last event), gets to choose the event that is played.  The numbers below the event shows how many dice are needed.&#10;&#10;Winning an event:  When a player wins, they will place their token onto the event space.  In the event of a tie, all winners may place a token onto the event space.&#10;&#10;End of the game:  The Dicecathlon ends when all 10 events have been played.  Players will earn a point in each of three categories:&#10;&#10;Row: Each row will be checked to see which player has the most wins in a row.&#10;&#10;Column: Each column will be checked to see which player has the most wins in the column.&#10;&#10;Color: Each color will be checked to see which player has the most wins in that color.&#10;&#10;If tied in any category, all tying players will receive a point.&#10;&#10;Place the winners on the gold silver and bronze spaces to celebrate the victory!  If tied at the end of the game, the victory is shared.&#10;&#10;Events:&#10;&#10;Red Events:&#10;&#10;Most Through Field Goal (5)&#10;&#10;Setup a field goal with two household items.

The first player to collect ten points is recognized as the master painter.&#10;&#10;Art Major has a nice blend of strategy, bluffing, and trading. Players are encouraged to trade anything they want, and with only two simple moves, the game can really begin moving at a quick pace.&#10;&#10;One interesting piece of Art Major is that paint only comes in primary colors (Red, Blue, Yellow), but most paintings require secondary colors (Orange, Green, Purple) to be complete. This means players must &ldquo;mix&rdquo; paints, and use extra cards to paint their masterpiece.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When complete the player to the left now takes their turn.&#10;&#10;I - Insert 'dungeon mat' - The first player inserts their 'dungeon mat' into the dungeon with any orientation.

You buy it by drinking that many fingers of your beverage. However, another player(s) may contest the purchase by drinking more fingers of their beverage. The player who drank the most fingers takes the 'magic mat' and can use it as and when described. There is only one of each 'magic mat' in the game and so only the 'magic mats' still on the table can be purchased. Once a 'magic mat' has been cast it is placed back on the table.&#10;&#10;EVENTS&#10;&#10;An event is triggered if a player lands on or moves over the following;&#10;&#10;I - Dungeon Key- If they don't already have a 'dungeon key token' of the same colour they can take one.&#10;&#10;II - Another player - The player whose turn it is fights the other player. Both players flip the 'event mat(s)'. Whoever has the highest number wins the fight. Re-Flip on a draw. If the player whose turn it is;&#10;- Wins - They may pass or land on the other player's mat. The winner may move the losing player one legal move away.&#10;- Loses - They must stop in the position prior to the player.&#10;&#10;III - Monster(s) or Trap - The player flips the 'event mat(s)' and must get the number or more displayed on the monster(s)/trap mat. If the player;&#10;- Wins - They win a 'trophy mat' (see Trophies p4). The monster/trap 'dungeon mat' is removed from the dungeon and is replace with the equivalent 'cleared dungeon mat'. Player movement continues.&#10;- Loses - They must drink the number of 'fingers' from their beverage as achieved from their 'event mat(s)' flip. They must also stop in the position prior to the monster(s) or trap.&#10;&#10;IV - Treasure room - A player can only enter the room if they have collected a key of each colour. IF so the player flips the 'event mat(s)' and must get the number or more displayed on the 'treasure room' mat. If the player;&#10;- Wins - They slay the dragon, take the treasure and win the game.&#10;- Loses - They must drink the number of 'fingers' from their beverage as achieved from their 'event mat' flip. They must stop in the position prior to the 'treasure room'.&#10;&#10;TROPHIES&#10;&#10;Players can gain 'trophy mats' by defeating monsters and traps. On the reverse side of a 'trophy mat' is an 'event mat'. this is so trophies can be stacked on top of the 'event mat' to form a stack. Whenever there is an 'event mat' flip for combat or movement the player may choose to flip a stack of 'event mats' with the trophies they have won. Each additional 'event mat' adds one to the result i.e. Flip and catch a 2 with a stack of 3 'event mats' to get a 4.&#10;&#10;FINGERS&#10;&#10;A forfeit in this game is performed by drinking 'fingers' of your beverage. this is done by holding that many of your own fingers against the glass and drinking that volume of your beverage. if there is a dispute in measuring an event mat can be used with one row equalling one finger.&#10;&#10;DIFFICULTY&#10;&#10;Beginner - If new players are finding flipping beer mats hard then they can use a 6 sided dice instead. &#10;Note: The game for those players will lose the skill aspect for catching values they need.&#10;&#10;Intermediate - 'Event mat(s)' can be flipped until caught. Note: This can slow down the game.&#10;&#10;Advanced - If 'event mat(s)' aren&rsquo;t caught you&rsquo;re fined a finger and the result is treated as zero.&#10;&#10;SINGLE PLAYER&#10;&#10;A single player game is played in exactly the same way as playing the normal rules. However there is some reduced setup, as there is no key collecting required so all key token mats can be removed from the game. As there are no other players all 'magic mats' can also be removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The 'magic mat' 'rejuvenate' can optionally remain. If it stays you're committing to potentially more then one drink. IF is removed, as with the 'just the one' variation, the game becomes more about beating the game with a single  glass of beverage.&#10;&#10;VARIATION: JUST THE ONE&#10;&#10;the 'rejuvenate' spell can also be removed to add extra difficulty to the game. It also puts a one drink cap on how much will be drunk in a game. This is a useful variation to implement when the player group only wish to have the one pint.&#10;&#10;VARIATION: HALF PINT DUNGEON&#10;&#10;Instead of playing with a 6x6 dungeon try playing with a 5x5 or 4x4 dungeon. Simply build the dungeon and place the remaining &lsquo;dungeon mats' into a stack. After inserting your dungeon key place the expelled 'dungeon mat' to the bottom of the 'dungeon mat' stack Then on future turns draw a mat from the top of the 'dungeon mat' stack and insert it into the dungeon, and again place the expelled 'dungeon mat' to the bottom of the 'dungeon mat' stack. This variation is useful when you have limited table space.&#10;&#10;GAME LINKING MULTIPLE DRUNKGEONS&#10;&#10;If you have multiple copies of Drunkgeon then they can be joined together to make up to a 6x12 dungeon by combining the 'dungeon mats'. Then use just one set of 'magic mats' and play the normal rules. The game will also now support up to 8 players i.e. two players of each colour.&#10;&#10;FAQ&#10;&#10;Q: Is Drunkgeon designed to get people drunk?&#10;A: No. The game is designed to be a fun first drink management game. A good player will carefully consider the best way to maximise their beverage, whereas other players may blindly run into fights and use magic to replenish their loses. Either style can work but the more sober player is more likely to win.&#10;&#10;Q: How do i shuffle the 'dungeon mats'? Are 'dungeon mats' inserted in a specific orientation?&#10;A: rotate the 'dungeon mats' as you shuffle because they can be inserted into the dungeon in any orientation.&#10;&#10;Q: Do you have to drink alcohol? what happens if glasses are different sizes?&#10;A: You may drink any beverage. Ideally everyone should use the same sized pint glass and beverage. However, if different make an agreement among yourselves i.e. a player drinks more glasses or uses smaller or larger 'finger' sizes. If anybody under the legal drinking age is playing the game then all players should drink non-alcoholic drinks.&#10;&#10;Q: How do you move the 'dungeon mats' with glasses on them?&#10;A: It is advised to remove the glasses while a row or column of 'dungeon mats' is being moved.&#10;&#10;Q: What happens if i am on a 'dungeon mat' that is pushed out the dungeon?&#10;A: The player is moved onto the 'dungeon mat' that was just inserted on the other side of the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Q: Players have blocked the 'treasure room' or are holding a 'dungeon mat' or 'magic mat&rsquo;?&#10;A: Don&rsquo;t let a player get all the 'magic mats' as there are spells that help with these situations. Read the magic mats carefully before playing the game.&#10;&#10;Q: I have picked up another 'dungeon mat' from a dead player?&#10;A: You may now choose either of your 'dungeon mat' to insert during your turn.&#10;&#10;",

Then players either take a trick, by adding cards on the table to become the same value as the card they play, build new cards by adding their card to a card already on the table, or play their cards on the table. Doubles and triples can also be built (and they can't be changed). Once all players have played their four cards, each player is deal four new cards. Play continues until all cards are dealt and played.&#10;&#10;Points are scored the follwoing in a players trick pile:&#10;Most cards: 1 point&#10;Most black cards: 2 points&#10;Last trick: 1 point&#10;Each star: 1 point&#10;Each SWUP (clearing the table): 1 point&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dopeman is a not-so-family-friendly board game. Play as a power-hungry drug dealer trying to get rich quick. Deliver goods to your customers but watch out for the cops and rival dealers. They&rsquo;ll try to take you down as you negotiate, bribe, and scheme your way to the top. Make the most money before time&rsquo;s up, and you win!&#10;&#10;The board is your block. To move forward, you&rsquo;ll move your game piece around the sidewalk clockwise. You&rsquo;ll also find a road that the cops drive on, a jail in the middle of the board, and apartments where you will deliver drugs. Your game piece moves based on the white die and the Cop Car moves based on the black die. The person who most recently did drugs goes first.&#10;&#10;There are four drugs in the game: Weed, Molly, Coke, and Shrooms. Before the game begins, you&rsquo;ll select one type of drug. There are four Suppliers on the board &mdash; one for each type of drug. Suppliers sell you drugs, which you&rsquo;ll then sell at a higher price to your Clients for a profit. Each player has one Supplier from which they buy their designated drug exclusively. You can buy baggies of your designated drug for $10 each from your Supplier every time you land on, or pass over, your Supplier&rsquo;s tile. You may buy as much as you can afford.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll receive a Text Message card every time you land on or pass over, a notification tile. There are two types - those from Clients who would like to buy drugs (this will include which drugs they want, how many baggies, and which apartment to deliver them to), and those from Informants who give you advantages throughout the game.&#10;&#10;To sell drugs:&#10;&#10;     Pass over, or land on, your Client&rsquo;s apartment (indicated by their Text Message).&#10;     Burn Text Message card.&#10;     Discard sold drugs to the box.&#10;     Pick up $50 per drug sold from the box.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is a Cop Car that travels around the board trying to bust dealers. If at any point, you have possession of drugs and the Cop Car lands on the adjacent tile to your game piece, you&rsquo;ll go to Jail. (You will only be arrested if you&rsquo;re in possession of drugs.)&#10;&#10;There are two ways to avoid being arrested:&#10;&#10;     Bribe the Cops with $50. (The money should be put back into the box.)&#10;     Blackmail the cops with an appropriate Text Message from an Informant.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you go to Jail, you must discard all of your drugs and weapons. To get out, you must complete a loop around the Jail with your game piece.&#10;&#10;If on your turn, you land on a tile shared by another dealer&rsquo;s game piece, you have the option to rob your friend, potentially stealing their drugs. Both players roll one die (the number you roll represents your Attack Strength), and the highest Attack Strength wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may buy weapons - Brass Knuckles, a Switchblade, and/or a Pistol. Weapons increase your Attack Strength during a robbery. You can continue to use your weapons until they&rsquo;re confiscated by the police.&#10;&#10;You can also buy an Associate. Associates follow you around the board, allowing you to increase your attack strength during a robbery and increase your movement around the board by +1.&#10;&#10;On their respective turns, players may trade Text Messages, drugs, weapons, or cash. There are no rules around trading &mdash; all is fair in love and drugs. If, at any point, you run out of cash, you&rsquo;re out.&#10;&#10;When time is up, each player is given one last turn, starting with the first player of the game. When the last player completes their turn, each dealer should count how much cash they have. If you have a weapon, or unsold drug baggies, you may liquidate them for the price you paid. Once each player has tallied their liquidated assets and cash, the player with the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pigeons are invading the main places of your city: streets, squares, monuments and of course also the balconies of your precious lofts in the city center. Every player must act to protect their beautiful houses and transform pigeons in trophies to save the city -&#10;&#10;Piccioni is a fast frenetic card game, competitive, for 2 to 6 players, made up of 100 cards (97 playing cards and 3 rule cards). It is very easy to understand and very funny to play.&#10;&#10;Every turn you take two Actions among: playing a card, drawing 3 cards or clean yourself from Guano. Depending on the Actions you take, you have to reveal a certain number of pigeons that can be assigned in the Places (Street, Crowd, High-Voltage Wires and Monument) or to any Player Area. The other players can counter your actions or share benefits.&#10;&#10;You win if at the end of the game you have the highest number of Victori Points: you lose VP if pigeons are on your balcony (in your player area) and if you have many Guano and Lots of Guano (poo and lots of poo) cards assigned, instead you gain VP when you transform the pigeons in trophies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each round consists of revealing the top word card, dealing 5 letter cards to each player, and revealing the top letter card to start the discard pile. A turn consists of drawing a card (the top of either the draw or discard pile), and discarding a card.&#10;&#10;The hand ends when a player can spell one of the two words on the word card from the letters in their hand, at which point they score the points that word is worth.  In the rare case that the letter deck has been gone through twice with no one spelling a word, the letter cards are all gathered and re-dealt.&#10;&#10;After 5 rounds, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Using an innovative system of command and control and the concept of unit attrition to combine the effects of casualties and morale from shooting and melee, a simple set of rules, which at last encourages the strategy and tactics used in ancient times. The stubbornness of the Roman legions and power of heavily armed cavalry are faithfully recreated along with the ferocious but fickle nature of tribal troops. Play well and you will see the enemies battle line collapse rapidly and completely, play poorly you will struggle to control your divisions and they will be defeated in detail.&#10;The command and control system adds unique dimensions to competition and points based games. Points can now be spent on the quality of commanders and the number of divisions fielded (typically 2-3). With better quality generals and more divisions you have more tactical flexibility but you can afford fewer troops.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Figure based as elements &ndash; no need to re-base your troops.&#10;     Alternate movement &ndash; facilitates play.&#10;     Command and control system, which replicates the fog of war.&#10;     Slick simple D6 based systems &ndash; easy to use, swiftly picked up and readily recalled.&#10;     Freely accessible &ndash; cross- referenced and indexed throughout.&#10;     Broken down into core rules and additional explanation.&#10;     Integral example army lists; exhaustive range of troop types.&#10;     Fast furious action &ndash; games of 1000 points per side completed in 90 minutes.&#10;     Faithfully gives a historical feel and generates authentic outcomes.&#10;     Example battle &ndash; Magnesia re-fought, includes scenario and orders of battle.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Fighter Duel covers combats between 2 to 4 fighters per side, and focuses on simple but realistic modelling of formation tactics, aircraft energy and situational awareness.  It now includes unique solitaire rules allowing any or all fighters to be placed under AI control.  In 2023 the simpler spin-off Fighter Duel Lite was posted, with just 2 pages of rules and no luck after initial deployment.

In this game, you are a gnome that gets to build a series of tunnels underground, and then gets to dig in the hopes of gathering enough gems and gold to reach the final goal!&#10;&#10;You assemble a modular board that is different with each game, and depending on how deep you dig, you may find treasures or trolls or even impervious rocks that damage your ability to defend yourself as you dig.  As you go through the deck of cards, the tunnels will get darker, the trolls will get stronger, and your ability to defend yourself will weaken as you mine tough stones that break your shovels.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you move through the tunnels, choose to dig, and try to empty your treasures out of your backpack and into your home base (the tin).  The more treasures you sell, the higher your score.&#10;&#10;This is a print-and-play game with components that fit into a typical mint tin container (paper tile pieces, paperclips, dice).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Drive on Giessen is a campaign game for WaW85 that allows the play of a set of linked game scenarios depicting a Soviet division&rsquo;s drive across West Germany against NATO forces.&#10;&#10;The Operational map will depict an area roughly from Eisenach GDR to Giessen FRG; a distance of about 75 kilometers in depth and 20 kilometers wide.&#10;&#10;The Operational map will consist of a series of locations connected across the map. Each location will represent a game area of two maps where each scenario will be played. Links between these map locations will represent road connections which will regulate how many game formations will be able to transit during each operational turn.&#10;&#10;During an Operational turn, both players may move their forces on the Operational map point to point to adjacent locations. This is done simultaneously and hidden from the opposing player. Forces that do not move from their location may improve their defensive positions or regroup.&#10;&#10;Battles will occur at each location that contains forces of both opposing players. How the forces arrived on the map will determine how the scenario will be set up. As battles occur, both sides may have reinforcements that can move into battle from adjacent locations. Also, artillery units in adjacent locations may be assigned as Artillery Support, and so act as off-board artillery for the battle.&#10;&#10;",

The other eight are winter versions, where any line of sight benefits of obscuring crops of cultivated terrain are gone and wilted, and so presents a whole different battle arena. The maps have ever so slight adjustments that also make them GEOMORPHIC, and so fully compatible with any other map in the World At War 85 series of games. Just line up the short edge or long edge of any of these maps to any other map in the series to create your own Forward Edge of the Battle Area.&#10;&#10;Two monster-sized scenarios are included for the monster-sized Fulda Gap configuration, our largest scenarios to date, using many formations and optional Battalion/Regimental Activation rules, also included in this Map Pack:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Breakthrough to Frankfurt: Almost a division of Soviet armor presses home its advantage in the final drive to reach the Main River crossings on their way to the Rhine!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hold the Damn Line!: NATO armored reserves find themselves finally in a position of strength to attempt a major counterattack into the onrushing Warsaw Pact hordes.

    "Description": "Objective&#10;Battleground Lanka is a team-based strategy game. Players take turns attacking their opponents. A team is declared the winner when all players on opposing teams have been eliminated.&#10;&#10;Cards&#10;There are 3 types of cards in the game: Character Cards, Action Cards and Health Trackers.&#10;&#10;Character Cards&#10;Each character belongs to one of 3 teams, indicated by the symbol on the upper-right hand corner of the character card:&#10;&bull;  Team Orange&#10;&bull;  Team Purple&#10;&bull;  Team Neutral aka &quot;double agent&quot;&#10;&#10;Action Cards&#10;There are 6 categories of action cards:&#10;&bull;  Attack&#10;&bull;  Defense&#10;&bull;  Health&#10;&bull;  Theft&#10;&bull;  Luck&#10;&bull;  Power&#10;&#10;Players and Setup&#10;The game can be played with 2 - 9 players. Players choose characters and join their respective teams.&#10;&#10;For Odd Number of Players: Choose an equal number of characters from Orange &amp; Purple, plus the Neutral character.&#10;&#10;For Even Number of Players: Choose an equal number of characters from Orange &amp; Purple.&#10;&#10;Choosing Character Cards: Players should be seated in a circle. Each player chooses a character, keeping in mind that adjacent players cannot be on the same team. Place your character card faceup for everyone to see, overlapping the Health Tracker&#10;&#10;Distributing Action Cards: Before the game begins, Action Cards are shuffled and the deck is placed facedown. Each player is dealt 5 cards facedown. Players pick up and view their cards, but may not show them to others.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;The game begins with the youngest player at the table.&#10;&#10;On each turn, in the order stated below, players shall:&#10;&bull;  Draw 2 cards from the deck and add them to their hand. Players may also choose to forego drawing cards on any turn.&#10;&bull;  Play as many cards as they wish (zero or more) from their hand. Only 1 attack turn card can be played per turn. Players may play other types of cards before and/or after an attack. Played cards are placed faceup in a common discard pile.&#10;&bull;  End their turn and discard any unwanted cards (see below)&#10;&#10;Ending your turn&#10;Players may end their turn at any time, even without playing a single card. However, at the time they end their turn, they must discard any cards of their choice until they hold at most 5 cards.&#10;&#10;Holding More Than 5 Cards&#10;Players may end up holding more than 5 cards outside their turn. This is permitted. Example: A player holding 5 cards draws a 6th card when another player plays brahma [Fortune].&#10;&#10;Managing the deck: If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile and place the cards facedown. Continue playing.&#10;&#10;Attacking&#10;Every attack card has an associated attack damage and attack weapon. Players play attack cards to deal damage to their opponents. On each turn, a player may play a maximum of 1 attack card.&#10;&#10;Defending&#10;When attacked, a player can defend themselves by playing a defense card in real-time, out-of-turn. Each defense card includes the attack weapon, that it can defend against. Some power cards or Superpowers can also assist in defending.&#10;&#10;Losing and Restoring Health&#10;If players are unable to defend an attack, they lose health equal to the damage, included on the attack card. Players can restore health by playing a health card during their turn to heal themselves or other players. (Illustration to the right shows how to track health)&#10;&#10;Player Revival: At the time that a player&rsquo;s health goes to zero, any player may play sanjeevani [Herbs] in real-time, out-of-turn, to revive this player back to 1 health.&#10;&#10;Player Elimination: If a player reaches zero health and isn&rsquo;t revived in real-time, they are eliminated from the game and must flip over their character card. The attacking player receives all in-hand cards from the defeated player.&#10;&#10;Stealing&#10;Players use theft cards to strategically weaken their opponents. Note: When stealing from another player&rsquo;s in-hand cards, you must choose that card facedown.&#10;&#10;Superpowers&#10;Each character has a unique skill, or Superpower, listed on their character card. Superpowers supersede Action Cards. Example: The Superpower of rama [Protector] allows players to enhance jatayu [Shield] as a defense against either attack weapon.&#10;&#10;Power Cards&#10;Players play power cards during their turn by placing them in front of their own or another player&rsquo;s character card. Power cards supersede Superpowers and Action Cards. Example: If a player has lakshman rekha [Palisade] placed next to them, any attack on the player must first be evaluated against this power.&#10;&#10;Chaos Mode&#10;Once you&rsquo;re familiar with the regular gameplay, try out Chaos Mode for a faster-paced experience. It&rsquo;s most fun with 5+ players. The group must decide on this mode before the game begins.&#10;&bull;  Attacks: every player may play up to 2 attack cards in a turn&#10;&bull;  Defense: any player may play a defense card in real-time, outside their turn, to protect the player being attacked. Note: If someone else defends a player, Superpowers of neither the player being attacked, nor the one defending the attack apply.&#10;&bull;  Revivals: Each player is entitled to 1 revival per game. That is, when players reach zero health, they revive back to full health in real-time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Movies have the power to excite and inspire, to elicit gasps and tears from audiences, to linger in memory for a lifetime. There is no question movies have moved multitudes. But for you, a powerful Hollywood executive, movies are just an elevator pitch and a high-stakes gamble. Let those directors and critics sweat the details when it comes to a film&rsquo;s &ldquo;artistic merit.&rdquo; All you care about is&hellip; the BIG PICTURE!&#10;&#10;Big Picture is a card game for 2-4 creative players about funding and releasing big budget movies in the hopes of securing a financial hit. From your lofty perspective, movies only amount to a few ideas thrown together and backed up with several million bucks so they can lure different demographics into the theaters. The real trick is in timing your movie&rsquo;s release so it can go down in history as a box office smash rather than a humiliating flop.&#10;&#10;Big Picture is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that this game starts with a few materials: index cards, a print-out to track market trends, and a few coins. Players will modify cards during the game as they create the movies that will cement their place in the annals of Hollywood.&#10;&#10;As movies are added to the deck, each future game will draw on the imagination of past games. The deck can grow indefinitely, preserving a legacy of movies and ideas. Players can return to the saga of their Hollywood executive careers over and over for gambles on brand new motion picture releases.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Once a planet is landed on with the Spinner, players draw Havoc Cards which tells how many spins the planet's-ring should be spun.  Players then flick their spaceship in the direction of the selected planet and aim to land their spaceship.  If a players spaceship lands in the planet, that planet is now controlled by the player and the planet is conquered. Up conquering a planet, the conqueror draws a Planet Card and follows the instructions on the card.&#10;&#10;And then the next player spins the &quot;Spaceship&quot; dial again and play continues as per the above instructions.&#10;&#10;About the board: The board is circular and contains 3 rings where the planets are located and in the middle of the board the sun is located - which holds the Spaceship Dial.  Each of the rings turns either clockwise or counter clockwise.  The board is divided into twenty quadrants.&#10;&#10;Spaceship Disks: Each player starts with 16 Spaceship Discs&#10;Cards: Planet and Havoc Cards&#10;Planet Holes: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn:&#10;Uranus, Neptune.

    "Description": "The Elevator Pitch&#10;&#10;Case #27 is social deduction game, meaning that the people around you will be participating in the game--although they will not know they are involved.&#10;&#10;In Case #27, you are a private detective, hired to solve a murder which the police have given up on. You must question your friends, relatives, acquaintances, or even strangers about their whereabouts at the time of the murder, as well as dredge up some information about their lives, in order to determine who the murderer is. Have casual conversations with them, ask innocent questions, but don't let them know that they are murder suspects!&#10;&#10;Number of Players&#10;&#10;One.  However, this solitaire game requires the player to speak with at least five other people.&#10;&#10;Expected Play Time&#10;&#10;Anywhere between 30 minutes and several days, depending on how often you speak with people.&#10;&#10;The Longer Pitch&#10;&#10;To play, print out the Case #27 PocketMod and put it in your pocket, along with a pen or pencil. Go about your day, having casual conversations with those around you. When someone asks you &quot;How are you doing?&quot; or a derivative thereof, that triggers the start of the game. That person is designated as the murder victim. You must now find out where they died, how they died, who killed them, and why.&#10;&#10;As you go about your day, other conversations you have and other people you encounter will give you further clues. Piece together the evidence to bring the guilty party to justice!&#10;&#10;Record your evidence on the PocketMod. Once you have solved the case, post your results online to reveal the murderer!&#10;&#10;The Explanation&#10;&#10;This is an idea I've had for a long time. I wanted to encourage gamers who are naturally shy or reserved (ahem... like myself) to have conversations with those around them. I thought it would be fun to have a game where the player's conversations with others and the things happening around them would trigger events or give the player tools to solve problems in the game.&#10;&#10;Detective stories largely involve the protagonist going around having conversations with people in order to gather clues. That's easily translated into a game that can fit into one's pocket or purse!&#10;&#10;I came up with different &quot;triggers&quot; that will give the player pieces of evidence. For example, the first suspect you encounter will be the first person to say some derivative of &quot;Hello&quot; to you once the game has begun. This will force the player to carry on a conversation with that person to find out such things as: where they were during the time of the murder, how they knew the victim, and whether they possessed the murder weapon.&#10;&#10;Try to innocently ask people questions without giving away the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Confederate Generals Sterling Price and Earl Van Dorn operated separate commands in northern Mississippi, late in 1862. Union troops, in a disjointed attack, struck Price near Iuka. Price withdrew, while at that same time Van Dorn made a move toward Federal held Bolivar, but then backed off. Van Dorn eventually gained command of Confederate forces in the area and united with Price. Van Dorn believed a quick move to take Corinth was the best way to proceed. US forces under General William Rosecrans were fortified in Corinth however, and the assault, though with some initial success, was costly to the Confederates. Van Dorn then withdrew to Holly Springs.&#10;&#10;But there were other options available to the southerners. Forcing Union forces to abandon Corinth by outmaneuvering them and blocking their supply routes was one alternative. Striking towards the important bases of Bolivar and Jackson was another option. Or attempting to take Memphis was a possibility. Then again, what if things had gone differently, and the US had been defeated at Corinth. The possibilities are now yours to explore...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Written by Steve Danes a nerve-shredding game of special forces action that ranges across three hundred years of history. From the time of Napoleon through to the trenches of World War One and right up to special forces operations in the early 21st century. A small team dropped in against the odds. Doom Squad is meant to be played as a solo game system pitting your team against the game engine. You can also opt for a multi-player game of 'co-operation' of two or several players going up against the game.&#10;&#10;Your troops will be equipped with the latest high-tech weapons and equipment from their historical or current era; which can mean muskets, rifled carbines or assault carbines with red-dot sights. It all depends on which period you pick. Rules are very simple and easy to use and are based around the use of one or more six sided dice to test for firing and close combat. Players will control one or more special forces squads and will be faced with an enemy that can be tough, disciplined, confused, resolute, unsteady and always unpredictable.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
