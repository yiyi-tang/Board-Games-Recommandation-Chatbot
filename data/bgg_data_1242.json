    "Description": "This is the fourth in a series of mini campaign books.&#10;&#10;This volume, The Siege of La Crenoilis following a similar format to its predecessors.&#10;&#10;Table Top Teasers are scenarios for wargames by another name.&#10;&#10;The intention is to provide the players with a credible military setting and objectives, which allow for rather more than simply lining up two similar armies and having a go at each other to until one destroys the other. It provides the context for the military action and allows for battles where, with quite uneven forces, both have a chance of victory depending on the setting and objectives.&#10;&#10;This one is about a siege, in the context of a mini campaign (using a map and fighting each scenario as it arises), but without the need for much of the campaign mechanics.&#10;&#10;There are some basic rules that cover the siege works, firing and damage. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Losses are taken in Bases as well.&#10;&#10;Uncontrolled and unexpected Events can result from the effects of enemy fire, but also randomly. A distinct and separate Mexican and US Army Event Deck is provided.  Unique and historical occurrences impossible to write rules for, but which could or did happen in fact, are now part of the mix as players seek to create a battle plan then react as best they can when it actually makes contact with the enemy.&#10;&#10;Prairie fires, false truce, amazing individual acts of courage, etc, all could influence battle in Mexico, and can for the players, too.&#10;&#10;GTSTE also provides optional Rules, including Ammunition, Stamina and Fatigue, Skirmishers, Sappers, Night Fighting, and Weather, among others.  &#10;&#10;Special Resolve advantages are available to the Mexican force which can field in miniature figures for the conduct of pre-battle Mass, a military band, field hospital, and Soldaderas supporting the soldiers.&#10;&#10;Introducing an innovative ground scale system for basing, the game may be played with ANY size figures, from 5/6mm,10mm, 15mm, 25/28mm to 40mm, using the same 1&rdquo; x .75&rdquo; and 2&rdquo; x 1.5&rdquo; square bases without effecting movement or weapons ranges. Artillery is mounted on pre-measured triangular templates (provided with the rules) indicating maximum firing angles eliminating the need for measuring in play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Solar Flare is a card game where you race against your friends to build the largest spaceship before the sun goes BOOM!&#10;&#10;This is an all-ages game (5+) that is fun, fast (10-30 min/session), easy-to-learn, and have a ton of strategic depth.&#10;&#10;Each deck allows for game sessions with 2-4  players and you can combine two decks to allow up to 8 players.  The game is extremely portable (camping, lunch breaks, etc...) and there are lots of rule variations to adjust difficulty and length-of-play.&#10;&#10;Card Types:  There are 3 types of cards.  Ship Segments (used to build), Action Cards (used to create change), and Solar Flares (used to end the game).&#10;&#10;Set-up:  Determine who goes first and set the number of Solar Flares that will end the game - recommendation would be to match the number of players (3 players = 3 Solar Flares).  Take the 54 cards and spread-out/mix-up face down to create your junkyard.  Each player selects three ship segments from the junkyard - if you draw a Solar Flare or Action then simply reshuffle until you have three segments.&#10;&#10;Play: On your turn you grab one card from the junkyard and play it.  If it is a Ship Segment, connect to your ship-build or leave off to the side (all cards are played face-up).  If it is an Action Card, read out loud, execute the action, and return to the junkyard.  If it is a Solar Flare then set to the side face-up.&#10;&#10;Building: Building a ship is easy.  At the bottom of every ship segment is a color and shape.  Simply match the shape (&quot;star&quot; shapes are wild) to connect two pieces.  You can sequence and reposition your ship at any time in the game. &#10; Note that color matches are a scoring bonus.&#10;&#10;Endgame: Once the last Solar Flare is drawn, the game stops.  Everyone can organize their ship one last time before scoring.  Scoring is simple; front/back/cross-connector segments are worth 10 points, all other ship segments are worth 5 points.  If a connection matches in color, you get a bonus 5 points.  Highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Variation:  If you are playing with young kids, simply make building a ship based on color-match and all segments are worth 10 points.  To extend or shorten game length you can adjust the count of Solar Flare's needed.  You can also play extended sessions by stacking multiple games, until someone hits a predetermined score (first to 500 points wins).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The octagonal, coaster pieces are reorganized by opponents through a card laying mechanic to create a blue line of waterway edges from the water source to their respective end coaster. Trick-taking card play is augmented by action cards allowing players set up large changes in the board state, and the presence of event cards introduces a small element of randomness. Whatever the methods, the goal is simple: connect your farm to the water source through a series of irrigation channels. How hard can it be?&#10;&#10;What is a coaster-based board game? &#10;Parched has dual functionality as a game and set of coasters. The game is housed in a wooden display case that is intended to live out on a coffee table or bar top, so that sealed, wooden game tiles are always within reach to hold a drink. This novel idea isn't a gimmick, though, the functionality is a logical offshoot of the story behind the game itself.&#10;&#10;The Story&#10;Reseco is a country with a rich history of brewing coffee and beer; however, recent drops in rainfall and redirection of water to a burgeoning kale and avocado industry are causing ripples across an increasingly arid landscape. The people are parched and so are their crops: beans and hops. Determining where the limited water gets directed is problematic, to say the least. Koffee Kings and Best Buds Hops find themselves at the center of the problem. They have come together to solve the issue using what they have on hand, drinking vessels and coasters, to negotiate the direction of irrigation channels on their overlapping properties.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On their turn, a Zombie Hunter can take a variety of actions including resolving objectives, shooting a Zombie, or rushing into Melee range. Attacks and other actions are resolved using dice.&#10;&#10;As Zombie Hunters fight, they will level up, allowing them to choose Feats which can improve their capability. They can also find Loot, represented by weapon and item cards that detail the statistics of the various weapons and inform the player of what dice will be rolled when attacking.&#10;&#10;The Zombie Master determines the actions of all Zombies, with the intention of providing a fun experience for the players. The Zombie Master can write custom scenarios or use one of several provided in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;Zulu Ops is designed to be easy to pick up and play, with simple to learn rules that expand as the Zombie Hunters level up. The rulebook contains all the information needed to run a game with any miniatures in your collection, as well as a Zombie Master's guide with tips and tricks on running a game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Can you avoid picking up Bad Habits that will send you Bankrupt?&#10;Living a lifestyle beyond your means?&#10;Gambling eating into your income?&#10;The Debt pile is stacking up?&#10;Spending out of control?&#10;&#10;This game will have you laughing in stitches as you strike and counterstrike your opponents. Be the last one standing!&#10;&#10;This is a fast paced card game where people are trying to avoid financial bad habits and not go bankrupt.&#10;&#10;The game play is fairly simple.  There are as many Bankrupt cards in the deck  as there are players. Each player is trying to avoid having to pick up Bad Habit cards from the deck. The more financial Bad Habits you get the more cards you have to draw - with any one of them possibly being a Bankrupt card! If you get a Bankrupt card and don&rsquo;t have any Insurance that&rsquo;s it you are out of the game. Last person standing wins!&#10;&#10;Just to make it a bit more interesting the player who picks up a Bankrupt card gets to put it back in the deck - wherever they want. Watchout! Players also have the chance to pick up Attack or Defense cards that enable them to strike and counterstrike against the other players, change the order of play, skip a turn or even block another player&rsquo;s action, take a peek at cards coming up in the deck, steal another player&rsquo;s card, transfer some Bad Habits to another player... Remember though any Bad Habits that you pick up could send you Bankrupt. If you start to accumulate Bad Habits in your hand the more Bad Habit cards you will have to pick up!&#10;&#10;It is a bit different from other card games that you might be used to. The goal is really to not be picking up cards and making your opponents pick up as many cards as possible. Whether you have a lot of cards in your hand doesn't matter BUT the more financial Bad Habits you have the greater the chance you will need to pick up more cards. The more cards you pick up the greater the chance you will go Bankrupt!&#10;&#10;The deck is full of twists and turns in the game. Just when you think you have the game won another player can turn the tables on you and send you Bankrupt!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "3D XYZ Chess is played on four levels, with 4x4 spaces each, effectively a 4x4x4 array of cubes. The game thus contains 64 spaces, or cubes, the same number as a regular Chess board. Moreover, each player controls a 16-piece army that is identical to the regular Chess army, albeit with some altered powers. The board is placed with vertical corners (rather than sides) facing each player, and the pieces are positioned initially in these opposite vertical corners.&#10;&#10;The Rook moves in a straight line through cubes that are connected via their sides; the Bishop moves in a straight line through cubes that are connected via their edges; the Queen combines the powers of Rook and Bishop. Effectively, these pieces retain their regular Chess moves, with the proviso that they can travel also in vertical planes. The Knight has a different and entirely new move that does not correspond to anything in regular Chess&mdash;the Knight moves one cube triagonally, in other words between cubes that are connected at their corners. The King's move is constrained, and the King can move only one square orthogonally, not diagonally, both within his plane and vertically. The Pawns step one space (or two  spaces initially) towards the opposite corner, and cannot move vertically. Pawns capture as they move, like the other pieces, and unlike Chess Pawns.&#10;&#10;The triagonal move of the Knights is interesting, because a Knight can only reach 16 spaces, one quarter of the board. The Knights of one side together cover only half the board. One could regard this as a flaw, but I do not think it is&mdash;there is a pleasing symmetry due to the opening placement of the four Knights of both sides. The two sets of Knights do not cover each other's squares, so opposite-side Knights can never capture each other, and together the Knights of both sides cover all spaces on the board. I am sure this special move of the Knight has interesting strategic implications.&#10;&#10;",

The Great Powers, using mercenaries gathered from all over Europe, have torn her to pieces.

Therefore, in each game, the players create a new Game Area.&#10;2) Instead of the usual resources (wood, stone, iron, etc.), the game uses mercenaries: Infantry, Shooters, Cavalry and Artillery. Each type of mercenary has 3 levels - the higher the level, the higher the ability of the unit. In total, there are 12 Unit Tokens in the game. Tokens have two sides and can be placed secretly. This creates huge opportunities for bluff and tactical combinations. &#10;3) The main way to obtain Unit Tokens is to create Political Ties between cities. The more complex the Political Ties, the more and better the Unit Tokens the player receives. This process is like playing Domino. Additionally, Unit Tokens can be bought or obtained free of charge upon conclusion of Alliances.&#10;4) The gameplay is divided into 5 Phases, which reflect the main aspects of the politico-military life of the Renaissance rulers and are consistently repeated in each Round. All phases are interconnected: the decisions made by the player in each phase have a definite influence on his subsequent actions. The strict sequence of phases allows players to carry out long-term planning. &#10;5) Each phase consists of several special actions available to all players. On a turn, the player cannot perform more than one action in a row. After each action, the turn is passed to the next player. All this speeds up of the gameplay, removes downtime and ensures high interaction between players. &#10;6) The competition of the gameplay depends on the skill of the players and their intentions. Usually errors are not critical if you are playing with players of your level. You can make up your failure to do some things by successfully doing others. &#10;7) The game can be completed in the First Round if at least one player can gain control of 5 or more Cities around their Capital City. Otherwise, the Round becomes the Final when there are fewer cities than the players.&#10;8) Victory Points are calculated only at the end of the game. Victory Points are awarded for different tasks, so there are different ways to achieve Victory. &#10;9) The Core Game (2-4 players) is a well-balanced strategy, with a simple and clear gameplay that can be easily mastered by casual players. However, the results of the game depend on the skills and experience of the player. &#10;10) Expansions increase the number of players to 5-6, and increase the depth and asymmetry of the gameplay.&#10;&#10;The game has adjustable gameplay complexity, modular design, high replayability and interaction. The game is especially suitable for players who like mechanics Tile Placement and Area Control.&#10;&#10;",

Erupting from earth below your feet to snap and scratch, they can easily overwhelm even the most experienced wastelander with the fury and surprise of their attacks. Observant wanderers may notice their burrows and avoid them, but attempts to eradicate them when burrowed are almost always fruitless. They are expert diggers and their sharp claws are just at good as shoving dirt as they are at slicing the unwary.&#10;&#10;While mole rats burrow and erupt from the ground, Radroaches will stay hidden and attack weak, wounded things. Their preferred habitats are cool, dank cellars and sheds, or underground sewers and train stations. Irradiated and swollen versions of their pre-war namesakes, Radroaches thrive in these inhospitable environments, sustained by refuse, decay and even (when necessary) each other. Despite the squalid nature of such places they often hide diamonds in the rough such as pre-war loot, energy sources, military bunkers or even entire vaults. Anyone daring enough to delve for these treasures should beware; more than a few wasteland wanders have met their ends via the incessant chittering bites and infected slashes of a wave of sullied Radroaches.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;6x Radroaches&#10;3x Mole Rats&#10;&#10;Please note does not include cards, unit and weapon cards are available to download for free, or get everything including their AI cards in the Raiders Wave Expansion Card Pack&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lelac is a two-player strategy game related to mancalas.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board with ten round pits arranged in a circle. Each player owns the semicircle closest to him. A line can be drawn to separate the semicircles for clarity. The game requires ten seeds and one standard six-faced die. At the start of the game, each pit contains one seed.&#10;&#10;During their turn, a player rolls a die. He then chooses one of his nonempty pits to sow. They take one seed from the sown pit, and move it counterclockwise according to the die value rolled. Then, they must roll to move each remaining seed from the sown pit. The turn only ends once the sown pit is empty. So, for example, if a player chooses to sow a pit with 4 seeds after his initial roll, 3 additional rolls will be needed.&#10;&#10;A player wins when all ten seeds are on their part of the board at the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Matches: The Online Dating Board Game is a PG-rated satire of 2010s app-based dating. Players roll the dice and move around a fictional town full of provocative-sounding venues while amassing matches, notification cards, and lifestyle improvements such as cars and jobs. If you land on a date spot, you can ask out one of your matches. A die roll determines whether the object of your affection says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;no thanks, I&rsquo;m busy&rdquo;, or ghosts you. A string of successful dates wins you the game&mdash;but watch out&mdash;jealous friends may attempt to undermine your love life by playing sabotage cards on you. Other notification cards that add balance and flavor to the game include &ldquo;Rideshare&rdquo; (move directly to any date spot), &ldquo;Mutual friend vouches for you&rdquo; (ask out a match even if you don&rsquo;t meet their lifestyle requirements), &ldquo;Free trial of premium&rdquo; (pick up double the matches), and many more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You roll the 6 dice and choose one to place your resources on a plot of land. You can choose to place either Food, Wood, or Stone. Unlike the majority of roll and writes, each player takes turns to choose one dice and utilize the value on the chosen die.&#10;&#10;You score points by connecting 3 resources of the same type. Any unused resources go to the Waste area and you lose points for those. The player with the highest points wins. So carefully plan your island empire and beat the others.&#10;&#10;",

And, that at the critical moment, some captain will misinterpret one of your commands that seemed so clear when the signals officer ran up the flags.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trafalgar Scenario Pack&#10;&#10;During 1804 and 1805, Napoleon wanted to seize the English Channel for just one week and place a French army on British soil. To do so, the fleets of Spain and France must combine in order to have any chance against the Royal Navy. The British Admiralty, conducting a brilliant campaign of blockade, could not let Napoleon succeed. But the net is never woven as tightly as the Admiralty desires, and the enemy slips out to sea. In the Fall of 1805 Napoleon's fleets are off the coast of Spain and poised to sail against Britain and her allies. But French Admiral Pierre Villeneuve does not know the whereabouts of the British fleet that has been chasing him for months. Where is his nemesis Horatio Nelson? Off the coast of Spain, Villeneuve loses his nerve and orders his combined fleet to reverse course and return to the safety of Cadiz. On this fateful day, in light winds, Nelson has tracked him down.&#10;&#10;Designed for play with the popular age of sail game, Fire As She Bears! (2.1), these scenarios place you in either the role of the feared Royal Navy or the beleaguered French and Spanish fleets. Can you change the course of history and turn Nelson's victory into his defeat?&#10;&#10;The Battle of Trafalgar Scenario Pack contains...&#10;&#10;Four scenarios from the climactic year of 1805:&#10;&#10;Calder's Action, 22 July 1805 (15 pages) - 15 British Ships of the Line square off against 14 French and 6 Spanish warships.&#10;    Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (24 pages) - the mother of all naval battles (60 ships).&#10;    Collingwood at Trafalgar, hypothetical (3 pages) - what if Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood had commanded the Royal Navy at Trafalgar?&#10;    Strachan's Action, 3 November 1805 (8 pages) - Four British vs. four French. The perfect introductory scenario for &quot;Fire As She Bears! - 2nd Edition&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each includes a scenario overview, special rules, weather status, victory conditions, ship record sheets, and a set up map.&#10;&#10;Special Bonus: Also included in the scenario pack are ten pages of rules modifications for converting FASB2 from a miniatures game, for play as a traditional hex based wargame. There are six pages of revised charts needed for these new hex based rules. This is a great opportunity for traditional boardgamers to experience this popular age of sail game. If you've previously shied away from Fire As She Bears! as a miniatures game, now with the core 2.1 rules and this scenario pack, you can experience this fleet level wargame.&#10;&#10;To go along with this, we've included two 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; pages of full color &quot;print and play&quot; ship silhouette counters (80 different ships, each rated for FASB2). Designed to complement the hex based rules, these counters are ideal for those who don't have a fleet of miniatures or those who want to get into action quickly.&#10;&#10;This pdf weighs in with over 60 pages of rules, scenario data, and play aids. We've broadened the horizons of the Fire As She Bears! system by including hex play, as well as, bringing together scenarios recreating one of the most dramatic years in naval history. We hope you enjoy our efforts.&#10;&#10;These rules and scenarios are designed for play with the 2nd Edition of Fire As She Bears! Ownership of that rule system is necessary for the full enjoyment of the Battle of Trafalgar Scenario Pack. The optional signaling system &quot;Hoist Signals Aloft!&quot; is not necessary for play (but we hope you'll use it anyway to get the feel of commanding a fleet at sea during the age of sail).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players deal damage to their opponents by creating Battle Lines on the game&rsquo;s 4x3 grid called the Nexus. These Battle Lines are formed by summoning Heroes unique to each player&rsquo;s premade Warband deck of 16 cards. Each Hero in a player&rsquo;s deck is unique and has abilities that activate when they are summoned or at the start of each turn they are on the Nexus. Knowing when and where to summon your Heroes is crucial to getting the most out of each card in your deck. Players must balance making and blocking Battle Lines with using their Heroes to collect Source, the resource needed to cast spells and summon additional Heroes. Running low on source could mean you end if you don&rsquo;t have the resources to block your opponent.&#10;&#10;EXOH is a head to head game for 2 players or 4 in teams of 2 on an expanded Nexus Board   The first player to KO their enemies leader wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rhonin's Lore is a tabletop board game for one to four players that will take adventurers on a journey to fight against a dark force of creatures from lore.  Adventurers may choose to take on the monster lords claiming dominion over the different terrains of the region, defend the villages surrounding the kingdom's strongholds, or, for the bravest of mortals, or take on the might of the great Archons of legends. This game offers both cooperative and player vs. player game play experiences as well as mini scenarios to explore the map and adventurer backstories.&#10;&#10;Adventurer's have been asked to help save Renwood from impending doom by defeating the monster lords. Adventurers have 15 days until the full moon rises and must grow their strength by defeating the creatures flooding into the land and acquiring upgraded weapons and armour. As the full moon nears, more powerful creatures will begin surfacing and the prophets of the kingdom speak of the monster lords entering the fight at the start of the 12th day. If the monster lords still live at the end of the 15th day, the realm is lost.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a hex-based map to identify different regions of Renwood. The map tiles may be rearranged to a players preference, but it is recommended to play the first game with the original map layout with later gameplay randomly placing the tiles within the region. Monsters will be summoned each night based on the summoning cards drawn by players. The summoning cards will identify the level monster (Minion, Legionnaire, Pendragon) that will be summoned based on the player's level and the space for which a monster will be summoned. The type of monster will be determined based on the terrain tile that occupies the space identified on the summoning card. Each player will draw one summoning card to begin each day of their adventure.&#10;&#10;The first encounters recounted in Rhonin's Lore originate from the land of Renwood. Renwood is a beacon of hope and a stronghold for peace in a region known as home to many creatures of lore. A balance has existed in the land for centuries as those seeking peace have learned to be weary of the lands claimed by the monsters of their lore. Those who venture into the dark seldom return and the monsters that lie within would seldom venture out, at least until the shifting of the winds. A fog and a darkness swept in and with it, the unspoken boundaries of old have been broken and the villages and paths, once safe in the light of the southern sun, are covered in a dark cold mist. The creatures of lore and only seen in nightmares reveal themselves again in flesh as their sights are set once more upon those who drove them into darkness.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Climb the social ranks and establish your scientific legacy to become the Astronomer Royal.&#10;&#10;Inside the Box is publishing this game in partnership with the Royal Observatory, Greenwich - the home of time.&#10;&#10;Players are attempting to collect and publish sets of papers on various celestial objects, first by selecting the best time of year to make their observations, (and hoping for good weather), as well as researching different technologies to be the first to publish research on planets, or publish the most impressive catalogues of nebulae.&#10;&#10;Each season has a different distribution of weather results, determined by a roll of 4 unique weather dice each turn, and players that select the same season will have to share the observations made - making your decisions as much about what you expect others to research as what openings the heavens give you in the first place.&#10;&#10;Will you be a commander of comets or a master of meteors?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player remains in his own part of the field. As soon as a flipper comes to rest on a spot marked &quot;bank&quot; the player tries to flip the piece into the bank building. If he fails, he must start all over again with that piece. If the flipper goes through the bank building to another part of the board, he must also start again.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get all four pieces (flippers) into the bank, the first one succeeding being the the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Burakito is the gateway to the world of Buraco.&#10;It consists of three different levels so that the little ones learn to play gradually until they can have a game of Buraco with their parents and friends.&#10;&#10;The game consists of placing tiles on the game board to form sets of neighboring animals, both of the same number and in consecutive numbers.&#10;&#10;Every time a player forms a set, she obtains a victory point. If during her move she forms two sets at the same time, she obtains one point for each set.&#10;&#10;When all the tiles have been placed on the board, the player who has obtained the most victory points throughout the game wins.&#10;&#10;There is a variant to play with special tiles that allow actions such as stealing from an opponent, playing twice in a row or skipping an opponent.&#10;&#10;",
