    "Description": "In Rainbow Cats, players compete to claim as much space in the house as possible for their favorite cat while making sure their least favorite cat's objects are nowhere to be seen.&#10;&#10;At the start of play, players draw two cat cards to establish their favorite and least favorite cats, information they need to keep secret! If a player somehow draws the same cat for both their favorite and least favorite cats, that player will not have a least favorite cat. The house consists of a 5x5 grid made up of items from seven different cats, each representing a color of the rainbow.&#10;&#10;The Seven Cats:&#10;Phoenix&#10;Ginger&#10;Daisy&#10;Jade&#10;Azul      &#10;Iris      &#10;Violet&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;14 Cat Identity Cards&#10;140 Cat Item Cards&#10;9 Grid Goal Cards&#10;25 Starting Grid Cards&#10;Last Played Card Token&#10;&#10;There are 7 cats total and 20 item cards for each specific cat within the item deck. During game play, players will take turns placing item cards on  a 5 x 5 grid. Players will also have  secret guide showing anywhere from 1-5 points for each spot on the grid. The player earns points for every preferred item card placed and loses points when their least favorite cat&rsquo;s items are on the grid. Each player has a different guide, meaning each player can gain or lose points for different spots.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Types of Cards:&#10;Cat Identity: Each player gets 2 of these. Keep them secret. &#10;Grid Goal: Each player gets 1 of these. Also keep this secret.&#10;Cat Items: Players will get a lot of these throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Set Up: &#10;To start the game , first distribute the starting grid cards face up on the table, revealing 25 colorful spaces where players can play item cards. Then shuffle and give each player 2 Cat Identity cards, 1 Grid Goal card, and 5 Item cards. Play will start with the person who has the most cats. If there is a tie then rock paper scissors should suffice. Players DO NOT select a favorite and least favorite cat at this time.&#10;&#10;During the beginning stages of the game, players will take turns drawing 1 item from the items deck and playing 1 item within the 5 x 5 grid, not placing any cards on top of existing Item cards within the grid. &#10;They also must place cards at least 2 spaces from the last card played if able.&#10;&#10;When they place an Item card on the grid, that player will also place the token to show the last played Item card. If there are no spaces available 2 spaces from the last card played then place anywhere an Item card has not been placed. Once 25 item cards are placed on top of all starting grid cards, players must select their favorite cats by placing it face down in front of them and adjacent to the 5 x 5 grid. The cat card left in their hand is their least favorite cat. Remember that if both are the same then they do not have a least favorite cat.&#10;&#10;How to play: &#10;At this time shuffle the remaining item deck and deal each player 10 additional item cards in order to build individual decks. From this point forward, players will draw and play from their individual decks. Players will continue to draw 1 item card and place 1 item card on top of existing item cards until all players have no cards left in their individual item decks. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be stacked on top of other cards.&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;t forget: Players can only place item cards 2 or more spaces from the last played item card.&#10;&#10;End of Game: &#10;After all item cards have been played from the players&rsquo; individual decks, players will reveal their favorite cats and calculate their points based on their secret grid card, giving positive points for each item of the cat on the grid. Players will then reveal their least favorite cat and referring to their goal grid card, deduct points from their total for each item on the grid from their least favorite cat. The player with the highest total points wins.&#10;&#10;Single Player Variant:&#10;In the single player variant of Rainbow Cats, you will shuffle all 140 cards and make a 5 x 5 grid with 5 item cards in each space. The remaining cards will become your deck. You will then shuffle your deck and deal yourself 5 cards. Next, you will shuffle and deal yourself two cat cards.&#10;&#10;Unlike the multi-player version, you cannot have the same favorite and least favorite cat and will need to draw another cat card.&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is to remove all 20 items for the favorite cat. You remove 2 items from anywhere on the grid as long as they belong to same cat. The only items you cannot remove are from your least favorite cat. You can also peak at as many item cards on the grid as you&rsquo;d like to help plan where you want  which cards to move. You can however move any item card from 1 space to another when you collect 2 of your favorite cat&rsquo;s items.&#10;&#10;For example, if Phoenix is your favorite cat and there are 2 red items for Phoenix showing, you will remove those 2 items and the items make a pair. When you remove a pair of items from your favorite cat, you can also move . Cards in hand can also be used. When cards in hand are played, it is replaced with a card from the remaining deck. The goal is to get all 20 items for your favorite cat.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1st of November 866AD, All Saints Day in the Northumbrian City of Eoforwic (Yorvik in Danish), would have been a hive of activity as the good folk went about their lives drawn to the Mynster for the feast of All the Saints and the last market fair before winter. Little did they realize the great calamity about to enter their lives, as outside the gates was a wolf, Ivar the Boneless (son of Ragnar). Standing over seven foot tall, a great warrior and military tactician but also a tyrant, Ivar was the cruel and ruthless leader of the mycel heathern here, or Great Heathen Army.&#10;&#10;Ivar, with his brothers Ubbe &amp; Halfdan, along with their army arrived from Ireland years earlier. After landing in East Anglia in 865 AD they demanded and received Danegeld in the form of horses and supplies from King Edmund and the East Angles. The Vikings now had mobility by land and sea. Their target was Northumbria, and the domination of this northern kingdom with its superior river and road networks that linked Yorvic and Dublin to the Scandinavian homeland.&#10;&#10;Northumbria in 866 was in a state of savage civil war. Osberht, the rightful King of Northumbria, had been deposed by Aella and a battle for control of Northumbria raged. Into this vacuum entered Ivar and his army. Chaos reigned as Ivar and the Viking Hordes began to launch attacks throughout Deira, looting, pillaging and killing in what could only have been a strategic plan by Ivar to weaken, subdue, cower, and splinter his enemies.&#10;&#10;By March of 866 The rival Northumbrian Kings had reached a tacit agreement to stop their civil war to march on the Vikings and take back their kingdom. Although weakened by civil war, it also meant that the warriors of these Saxon lands were battle hardened, well trained and in such numbers that a full frontal assault against the Vikings at Yorvic was planned. For a short period it looked like Saxon success was theirs&rsquo; for the taking. But Ivar had arranged his defenses with all the cunning of an Alpha Wolf and the Saxons were defeated and King Alle would suffer the gruesome Ritual of the Blood Eagle.&#10;&#10;Ivar the Boneless is as much a strategic as tactical game. While there will be pitched battles both players will have to make decisions as to when and where to fight, and how best to maximize your strengths, whether Viking or Saxon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Macau-Wars Variation&#10;&#10;Macau Wars It&rsquo;s a major game variation of the Macau card game based on the Macau (card game) Macau Plawno Variation, still being in development on github.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;2 or more players are dealt 5 cards each; after that, the top card from the deck is then placed on the table. Play starts to the dealer's right.&#10;&#10;The next card played must be of the same suit or the same value as the card on the table. For example, If a 7 of spades was on the table, the player can play a 9 of spades or a 7 of clubs or any other card that matches 7 or spades. If the player cannot play a card, he must draw from the deck.&#10;&#10;Cards cannot be played in runs, i.e. 5 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs but a minimum of two or more the same value cards can be played.&#10;&#10;When an action card is played, the player next (or previous depend on the action card) in the sequence must complete the action or add to it to pass it onto the next player in sequence. When down to a single card, a player must say &quot;Macau!&quot;. If a player forgets to call &quot;Macau&quot; before the next players move, the player must draw 5 cards. The winner of the game is the first player to have no cards; in instances of more than 2 players, gameplay continues until only one player is left with cards. In case of Macau Championships once the first player to have no cards wins and the game stops. The winner shuffles the cards and the new game starts. One point is then assigned to the winner.&#10;&#10;For the avoidance of doubt: If the player plays King of Spades and King of Hearts with King of Hearts on top the next player will pick up 5 cards as the top card takes precedence in this case.&#10;&#10;War&#10;&#10;In this game, a scenario called a war and deception can be created when players consecutively play 'special cards' to make other players increase their card count.&#10;&#10;War is started when 2, 3, King of Spades (to a previous player) or King of Hearts is played. Causing players to pick up cards. When a war starts, players can play any 2s and 3s as the suit and value are being ignored during the war. Players can also play King of Spades and King of Hearts regardless of the suit currently on the deck and value of the cards as long as they are 2, 3 or mentioned Kings. Queen of Hearts can be played anytime during the war to stop the war causing the player to not pick up any cards. In this variation of the game, players can often pick up as many as 20 cards (they all add up, e.g. 2+3+2+King of Spades+King of Heart=17).&#10;&#10;When King of Spades is played the previous player must pick up 5 cards or play another action card (any 2, 3, King of Hearts, King of Spades (to a previous player)). After the previous player, the game goes back to the player who played King of Spades.&#10;&#10;Any queen can be placed at any time on any war card regardless of the current suit. See below section for the action of each Queen.&#10;&#10;Action Cards&#10;&#10;2, 3, King of Spades, King of Hearts - War cards that cause players to pick up cards (2,3,5 respectively).&#10;&#10;If a Jack or Ace is played, the player placing the Jack or Ace can call for a non-action card value (in case of Jack) or a suit (in case of Ace). The difference is that the suit is ignored and any Jack can be placed on any Ace, and any Ace can be placed on any Jack, therefore, ignoring the requested suit or value of the previous player.&#10;&#10;Queen of hearts - stops the war and causes the player not to pick up any cards.&#10;&#10;Queen of diamonds - the next person is skipped (also during the war).&#10;&#10;Queen of spades - order of play switches directions (also during the war).&#10;&#10;Queen of clubs - player can chose who play next (cannot chose her/himself) (also during the war).&#10;&#10;If a 4 is played the deception part starts, and all the players must miss a go, unless they have a 4 (if they don't have a 4 or they chose not to play the 4, they don't pick a card from the deck), in which case they can add this to the original 4, and all players in sequence must miss a go, unless someone has a 4, in which case they can add this to the original 4 and so on. If no one else has a 4 then the last player, who put 4 plays as many times as there are 4s. For example, if there are four 4s after the last player played the 4, the player must play four times. Note: the last player will play four times against him/herself, that also include all the action cards which will apply to the player him/herself. The deception is when someone doesn't want to play a 4 but has it and can play a 4 after everyone said they don't/have a 4 causing this player to have more turns.&#10;&#10;Joker replaces any card.&#10;&#10;Open Cards&#10;&#10;The more difficult version of Macau Wars (and any Macau variation) is a game played with open cards. That means that all the players cards and the draw deck is shown. This is similar to Chess where by knowing all the cards players must think about strategy and future moves. Open cards variation might take hours to finish.&#10;&#10;",

Each Turn, a player advances the current Month, draws an Event card, and resolves the FBI track, which generally tends to hinder the player by adding additional Heat to their most high-profile Assets.&#10;&#10;In the Activation Phase, the player can activate their Assets. Most Assets allow the player to roll a variable number of Income Dice, though others allow the player to Refresh Activated Assets, move Heat between different Assets, or take more unique actions. Depending upon the result of the Income Dice, the Asset might generate Clean or Dirty Money, gain Heat, or some combination of the above. If an Asset gains 5+ Heat, it is discarded from play and advances the FBI Track by one space. The exception to this is the Boss Asset, which is not discarded from play (but still advances the FBI Track).&#10;&#10;The player can then use their money (Clean or Dirty) to purchase additional Assets, weighing carefully just how much money should be invested and how much should be saved away.&#10;&#10;If the player has accumulated enough Clean Money at the end of a Turn, they meet their quota and win the game. If they have not met their quota at the end of 12 Turns, however, their boss rewards them for their failure with a pair of cement shoes and a long walk off a short pier.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Aboleo is a two-player strategy board game played on an Aboleo board. On the surface, the board resembles a chess or checkers board but has some significant differences. It is a checkered game board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid with each square containing two dots (one at the lower left and one at the upper right) or circles indicating the proper positioning of a player&rsquo;s piece within the square.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one general, two chariot units, two cavalry units, two archer units, and eight infantry units. Each of the six piece types moves differently. An additional piece which is not present at the beginning of the game, is the noble. The noble piece replaces any infantry unit that makes it to the opposing player&rsquo;s side of the board and moves in the exact same fashion as the king. The objective is to 'Aboleo' or abolish the opponent's nobility by executing three attacks resulting in the &ldquo;death&rdquo; of the piece. If the king is killed and no other nobility exists, the game is ended. If a noble exists, that piece is then promoted to king and game play continues. This is called a &ldquo;coronation&rdquo;. If more than one noble exists, the player has the option of choosing which piece is promoted to king.&#10;&#10;To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and kill the opponent's pieces, while supporting their own. In addition to Aboleo, the game can be won by voluntary resignation by the opponent, this would typically occur when too many forces have been lost, or if the player feels that the death of his nobility is unavoidable. A game may not result in a draw unless both players agree to concede.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "JATAK! - commonly translated as YESSIR! - is a highly competitive dice game for two or more players. Originally invented in the pubs, bars, and taverns of Copenhagen where dice roll free, it was designed as a contemporary alternative to the timeless - yet sometimes also timeworn - classics such as Liar's Dice, Mia, and Four Twenty-One. Whereas many traditional dice games only play well with multiple players, JATAK! is equally strong with two, three, or four players.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with a dice mat, a dice cup with two dice, and a separate luck die. A common pool of three dice is kept on the table between the players. Players take turns spending points on their luck die to manipulate the private dice in their cup and the public dice in the pool. However, they can also choose to say JATAK! and pass on the turn. If all players say JATAK! one after the other, the round ends and the cups are removed. The player who has the strongest combination of dice between their cup and the pool wins the round. The first time a player wins a round they flip over their dice mat. The second time they remove it, and the third time they win the game.&#10;&#10;The beating heart of JATAK! is the luck die which begins at 6, but quickly falls dangerously low as players spend points to manipulate the dice to their own advantage. Points on the luck die can only be regained if a player loses a round (+1 point) or pushes their luck by rerolling their cup and withdrawing from the round without looking at the result (+1 point). The latter is obviously a desperate move, but one that can pay great dividends if used with skill and care.&#10;&#10;Print-and-play dice mat designs and a complete description of the rules in both Danish and English can be found in the files section on this page.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It introduces a unique character that completely changes the flow and strategy of the game: the Monarch, who is responsible for making all the Kingdom&rsquo;s decisions.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player receives a card with a secret role that indicates which team they belong to and what special abilities they have. The Citizens of the Kingdom are the majority, but they don&rsquo;t know who belongs to their team; Conspirators are the minority, but they know who belongs to each team, which allows them to plan and collaborate to destroy the Kingdom.&#10;&#10;The game develops in alternating day and night phases. In the day phase, the Monarch has the opportunity to condemn a player for conspiracy with the Citizens&rsquo; help; in the night phase, Conspirators secretly wake up to eliminate an innocent Citizen. The Kingdom wins if they condemn all the Conspirators, while the Conspirators win if they eliminate all the Citizens.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game you play roles of couriers during World War II, attempting to deliver as many messages as possible to various cities in Europe. At the same time you have to avoid German patrols both on land and sea.&#10;&#10;You are one of the real historical figures, like Jan Nowak-Jeziora&#197;&#132;ski, the famous &quot;Courier from Warsaw&quot;, Jan Karski or El&#197;&#188;bieta Zawacka.&#10;&#10;Your deck of cards enables you to travel via land and sea routes or to hide safely in certain cities. You can pick up one message at a time and if you manage to deliver it safely, you are rewarded with points and a new card to improve your deck by allowing for more effective movements. Sometimes you can also influence movements of German agents to clear your way or block it for the opponent.&#10;&#10;The game ends when certain number of messages has been delivered, and the courier with most valuable accomplished missions wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the game about your city, Kalmar. You buy, sell and trade properties and building plots to win. You will feel at home on the game board, going from Norrliden to Varvsholmen. Cards with pictures and instructions take you from familiar and unfamiliar situations and locations in the historical, contemporary and future Kalmar.&#10;&#10;Players assume the role of landlords, purchasing and trading streets, squares and properties. Players landing on the streets and squares of other players must pay rent depending on if the plot is empty or if properties have been built on the plot. The unique plots for the squares Larmtorget, Stortorget, Lilla Torget and Skvallertorget, and for the local newspapers &Ouml;stran and Barometern, are unbuildable, meaning that the rent is fixed; buying more of the same set garners you more money when players land on those plots.&#10;&#10;Players play the game by rolling two dice, adding the sum together and moving on the game board equal to the sum of the dice. Players may only buy properties that are unowned, and it takes owning all streets of an individual color set to be able to build properties on the streets. For example, to be able to build properties on Norrliden, Funkabo must also be owned by you, as it belongs to and completes the orange set. While moving along the board, players may also land on tile which force you to draw cards, whose effects may be both beneficial and disadvantageous.&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is, by the roll of the dice and mercantile shrewdness, to be the last player left with money, having forced your competitors into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A band-battling game for two to four players to rock and roll the dice!&#10;&#10;You are a musical artist. You have your eyes set on one goal: playing a successful show at The Ultiplex, the greatest concert venue in the land. To do it, you'll need to use your inspiration points to write and practice songs, recruit bandmates, and keep their egos happy, or else they'll leave you to start a solo career (or worse, join an opponent's band). Along the way, you'll live the artist lifestyle, and work your way up to The Ultiplex with gigs at the dive bar Midnightly, and the hipster cafe the Artful Baboon.&#10;&#10;To play songs, you roll a 12-sided die and add up any artist or bandmate bonuses you have. A strong performance will earn you a &quot;Good&quot; result, and an epic performance earns you a &quot;Sick&quot; result. Each venue requires a certain number of songs played &quot;Sick&quot; in order to have a successful show. You'll carefully craft your set-list, with songs requiring different instrument combinations to play: keyboard, drums, and guitar. Make sure you stroke the ego of your guitar-playing bandmate Tennessee, because if she leaves you, you're never going to play that &quot;Anthem That Glorifies Being Young and Lost&quot; or the &quot;Song with a Catchy Chorus but No Verses.&quot;&#10;&#10;Turn up your speakers, tune your guitar, and try to become a One Hit Wonder!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Earning and placing pillars will help slow Minotaur's progress and earn extra points.&#10;&#10;In a two-player game Daedalus has less influence on Minotaur's movement, which is now controlled by the second player. Minotaur can topple and carry away pillars built by Daedalus, and steal labyrinth sections before they are set in place in order to build temples. Both players may build temples to different gods to thwart each other's progress.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The first player to reach 100 cm or more wins.&#10;&#10;Each player builds his mountain during turn by turn. The smallest player starts. In front of him, he places the base of the mountain (wooden board) and the tokens with the symbols facing down. He randomly turns a first token, takes the piece of wood with the corresponding symbol and places it on the wooden base. The player has the right to place it on the position he chooses, but only on the edge ! This is the first part of the mountain.&#10; Next, he turns a second token, places once again the corresponding piece of wood on the previous piece and continues to build his mountain. The player may, at any time, decide to continue or interrupt his construction. If the player is satisfied with his mountain, he stops, measures its height and writes down the score. The next player can start. If, on the other hand, the player continues and his construction collapses, his score will be zero for that round and the turn of the next player begins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Japan, there are summer festivals known as Nebuta Matsuri. The most famous one takes place at Aomori, and is considered as an intangible national treasure in Japan. During the festival, huge floats (Nebuta) are paraded through the town, depicting brave warrior figures or kabuki style heroes and gods or just local celebrities, and dancers walk alongside dressed in special costume (Haneta). They perform a sort of bouncing dance as they walk, and call to the mass of tourists to join in. The call is a sing-song, Rasser&#196;&#129; (&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#188;), and they sing &quot;Rasse ra, Rasse ra, RasseRasseRasse ra&quot;. In addition, there are Crow Dancers, Karasu-zoku (&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#151;&#143; &quot;crow gang&quot;), who act to disrupt the festival.&#10;&#10;Nebuta Beat is a party game to simulate the rhythmic chanting and dancing. Each player gets a specific dancer card, showing their colour and their own dance move. The players stand around the table, taking turns to play a card from their hand to the centre in rhythm with the chant. All the players keep up the chant, Rasse ra, Rasse ra, RasseRasseRasse ra, and according to which cards are played (by colour and form), different players must perform their correct slow bouncing dance steps.

Not only does Fields &amp; Flocks add six player support to the game, but it introduces the Harvest phase, where you are able to direct the actions of your serfs in managing your agricultural holdings. Grow crops and raise livestock, either selling them to the various citizens in the town for silver, or attaching complete fields and flocks to structures for additional prestige. Fields &amp; Flocks also includes more Characters, Citizens, Visitors, and Events, so each game is a unique experience.&#10;&#10;Most new action takes place during the Harvest phase. This adds a worker placement mechanic to the game, where your serfs can interact with Fields and Flocks, as well as Citizens and structures. Depending on the Citizens in town and the structures in play, different strategies are available.&#10;&#10;As an added bonus, the expansion comes with a full reprint of all cards from the base game. These will be printed on higher quality card stock, along with a switch to symbols instead of color bars on structures and the inclusion of district symbols to avoid confusion and aid color blind players. Some art which originally came out darker than anticipated will be rebalanced to ensure everything looks great.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Explorers and Thieves continue to wage war in their pursuit of the untold power hidden in the four shrines on The Island of El Dorado. But even as their civilizations grow vast, their economies grow prosperous, and their armies grow strong, their greatest battle yet will be against the power of the island which they&rsquo;ve just unleashed. Enraged by the conquests of the explorers and the misdeeds of the Thieves, the Guardian of El Dorado has risen from the depths of the island to reclaim what is eternally hers. With the power of a god she summons beasts, giants, and ruthless natural disasters to reclaim the shrines and cleanse the island of its trespassers.&#10;&#10;In The Revenge of El Dorado, explorers and thieves widen and deepen their strategy as they face off against the mythical Guardian of El Dorado and the fury of the island she defends. Expanded explorer boards allow players to upgrade their buildings and units, unlocking new abilities, new military and economic tactics, and new paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Fully cooperative gameplay allows explorers to band together against the island, employing complex strategy to control the shrines while defending against the islands varied and savage attacks. Or, take control of the Guardian herself (as a completely asymmetric faction), championing her army of beasts, giants, and the power of the island against the Thieves and explorers as she races to secure her shrines.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

These  resulted in nearly 100 Israeli dead and injured as well as extensive property damage, including private Israeli homes. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol authorized a retaliatory raid, dubbed Operation Shredder, into the southwest corner of the West Bank against the town of Samu&rsquo; and several other villages south of the city of Hebron. The raid was carried out by the Israeli 35th Paratrooper Brigade, supported by tanks, armored halftracks, aircraft and artillery. It was the largest invasion of Jordanian territory to that point, and meant to convey a strong message that Israel&rsquo;s restraint in the face of these attacks was at an end.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, Jordan&rsquo;s King Hussein, ruler of the West Bank, was the sole Arab leader seeking a path of moderation with the Jewish State. For nearly three years the King had been meeting secretly with Golda Meir, the Israeli Foreign Minister, in an effort to forestall another war in the region and to find some path to peace. US President Johnson had helped facilitate these meetings, and supported King Hussein with these initiatives. The Israeli strike at Samu&rsquo; was fraught with peril, both militarily and politically. Can you do better?&#10;&#10;Each copy of Shredding Peace is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets with game charts and tables.&#10;91 un-mounted, double-sided counters&#10;8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Infantry (Airborne, Headquarter) and Heavy Weapons are all Companies of about 100 to 120 men. Tank and the armored car units represent 2 vehicles, and each halftrack represents 4 vehicles. A hex on the map is about three quarters of a mile across. Each turn represents one half hour of time. The game uses a standard deck of playing cards and a ten sided die for play.&#10;&#10;Shredding Peace is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Dariusz Buraczewski.&#10;&#10;",

Though this expansion was originally going to be named Surviving Mars, Eagle-Gryphon Games made the decision to change the name to On Mars: Alien Invasion to better reflect the theme and content of this expansion. The game narrative is contained in four chapters of a story written by Nathan Morse. Gameplay contains four new and different ways to expand upon and play the base game. You will play one versus many; completely cooperatively; and even solo if you wish, depending on the chapter. Included are four fresh and completely replayable ways to establish colonies On Mars!&#10;&#10;For instance, here is the narrative that opens the first chapter and sets the stage for all of the following action:&#10;&#10;Alert! Sensors indicate that aliens are invading the famous red planet! Long have the conspiracy theorists predicted this. The threat to your mission is too great; you must take action. Will you be able to prevent the infectious spread of these beings bent on expanding to every habitable planet in the galaxy? Or will you play for the other side, a species trying to establish a colony on Mars, blithely oblivious to the danger their expansion represents, unaware that there are others out there eager to keep humans &ldquo;where they belong&rdquo; on Earth. &#10; &mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;On Mars: Alien Invasion is a short story expansion to On Mars made in 4 chapters with 4 different modes of play.&#10;&#10;The short story is called Alien Invasion and contemplates the following Chapters and modes of play:&#10;&#10;Chapter 1 - Invasion - 1 vs All - 3 to 5 players&#10;Chapter 2 - Outbreak - Co-Op - 2 to 4 players&#10;Chapter 3 - Blackout - Co-Op - 2 to 4 players&#10;Chapter 4 - Monolith - Solo - 1 player&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Additionally players can try to make a set of seven Secret Message cards, and upon succeeding they can discard the set to search the draw pile for any card they need. First player to complete one doll set of seven cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
