Each of the route cards shows the four locations where the fox might be hiding.  The path is connected to a tile on which the fox playing piece is placed. They Prince players each have four tiles representing the four locations.&#10;&#10;Each turn they try and predict at which location the fox will appear by laying one of their tiles face up.  The fox player then turns over his top card and 'appears'.  If any of the other players have a match then they move down the path to the next location on the route showing that location.&#10;&#10;Over twelve rounds players progress down the path towards&#10;the fox - the first player (if any) to reach the fox is the winner.  If no-one manages to reach the fox then it is the player that progressed the furthest down the path that is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

As you go around, you buy up &quot;countries&quot; to charge other players &quot;port fees&quot;. The countries can have their industry developed by buying Factories (e.g. houses/hotels). The Community Chest/Chance cards have been replaced by Spot Market and Commodity Exchange decks, which are used to simulate a player's speculating on the spot market. A key difference from Monopoly is that you can build up your military and use it as an alternate means of conquest.&#10;&#10;",

Starting at opposite corners of the board, white attempts to capture black. Each player moves his knight according to standard Chess rules but also places two markers on his previous location as well as on another location of his choice. When all 30 markers have been placed, white has ten more moves in which to capture black. If he is unable to do so successfully, black wins by avoiding capture.&#10;&#10;There are two more rules:&#10;1) If either knight is unable to move, the game ends and black wins because he avoided capture.&#10;2) If your opponent's knight only has one remaining place to move, you may not put a marker there.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Re-developed as Pferde&#195;&#164;ppel &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Sensors marked on his heads up display where each of the other four in his squad where located and where the enemy troopers where positioned, or as best he could tell from what his scanners were telling him anyways.&#10;&#10;As he leaped over the terrain, he became exposed and incoming fire began to pelt off his armor.

It allows the simulation of amphibious assaults, helicopter borne troops, precision weapons, modern MBTs and is current till 2010 with the current expansion.&#10;&#10;The system emphasize tactics and terrain command and control. They pay attention to troop psychology, what is possible to do with the men who control the weapons, and how these men can be efficiently commanded. Infantry are essential and their tactics more varied. With the attached points values, this system can be used in conventions and competitions where players expect to have similarly-capable forces, even though their opponents may never have fought historically. A 1950's army, using the system's clever victory conditions, can take on the latest Western army.&#10;&#10;",

They go for a premium on earth and you could become rich. But first you better concentrate on paying off your ship.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Rocks for Sale, two to five (best for three to five) players fly their space ships along a pick-up and delivery circuit from the assayer's space station to the asteroid belt and back. Players tow asteroids back from the belt and sell them to the assayer, with the eventual goal of being the first to pay off their ship. But there are additional costs to running a mining ship, such as fuel, repairs and blasting charges. Mining in space can also be dangerous. Fuel leaks, overheating engines and other miners' blasting charges are only a few of the hazards an asteroid minor may face.&#10;&#10;Will you be the first to pay off your ship? Or will cost overruns make you sink ever deeper in debt?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vermix issued his challenge and then leaped into the clear skies that lay before his cave's entrance. The smaller air dragon returned the roar and beat its long wings as it began to gain altitude. Vermix was large, a fire dragon of both mighty age and size. With some amusement Vermix mused on the foolish air dragon and how it would perish under his talons and burn with his breath.&#10;&#10;Beating his own great wings, the massive fire dragon rose slowly. Meanwhile the swifter air dragon had reached a great height overhead and with a shriek, folded its wings tightly against its sinuous body and dove into Vermix like some blue-grey spear, thrown by an angry god of war.&#10;&#10;The two dragons crashed into each other with bone shattering force. Stunned by the impact, Vermix struggled to bite at his foe, but the smaller air dragon had gained a tight grip on the fire dragon's fore legs and was even now ripping at Vermix's armored hide with its own sharp talons.&#10;&#10;Finally Vermix turned his great head and bit down on the neck of his foe. The air dragon screamed as Vermix crushed its throat, slaying the smaller dragon in one mighty snap of his jaws. Spitting the dead beast from his maul, Vermix turned his body as it fell, trying to scoop the air up with his wings and to either slow his fall or possibly even pull up from of the deadly plummet out of the skies.&#10;&#10;As the ground below rushed up, Vermix began to flap his might pinions once more, beating the air with his massive chest muscles, like belts of iron these muscles struggled to gather the wind about him. Slowly he regained control and turned the headlong fall to his doom into a controlled swoop. As he passed mere inches from the tops of the trees of the forest below him, Vermix issued another roar, letting all that could hear that his was king of the dragons still, and would remain so until another dragon took his life and crown.&#10;&#10;This is Dragon Wars, yet another Mini-game from Bad Baby Production. In Dragon Wars, you and other players take on the role of a might dragon, dragons that then launch themselves into the skies and battle for supremacy of all about them.&#10;&#10;Using a fast turn based system; the combat is swift, the excitement nail biting and the strategy intense.

She had been dead two days, but here she was, dragging herself out of her hole, red eyes hungrily staring at Chuck. Suzy screamed again, but Chuck barely heard his girlfriend's cries of horror as more of the waking dead shambled towards the two of them.&#10;&#10;Maybe it was the odd, green colored comet that had hurled overhead a few hours ago, or the illegal biological and chemical weapons the government truck had spilled across the creek. Chuck thought it was the old voodoo woman's curse that had been placed on the town. Whatever the cause, the dead were walking again, and they were hungry for human flesh.&#10;&#10;Coming out of his shock, Chuck grabbed Suzy's hand as the two of them began to run.

Only cards with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5 are used.&#10;&#10;SHUFFLING: Yes.&#10;&#10;DEALER: There is no dealer.&#10;&#10;SCENARIO:&#10;&#10;The Multimillion Dollar Inheritance, Left in 1917 By Californian Gold Miner to His Future Smartest Great-Great-Grandchild, Still Waits for the Winner.&#10;&#10;Four generations of Henry Smith's siblings have been waiting for 90 years, for only two of the qualified heirs, Emily and Jacob, brother and sister, to turn sixteen by 2006 and enter into genealogy battle with their numerous ancestors and trustees about what being the &quot;smartest&quot; heir means.&#10;   &#10;    Henry Smith, who made his fortune by discovering gold in California during the Gold Rush and his future investments, signed his will in 1917 at the age of 86. With an unusual precision, he left his 35-year-old son George without the money. Smith was angry that his son was not married, did not have siblings, and was planning to join the United States Army in the battlefield in Europe during WWI, where he could be possibly killed.&#10;&#10;Instead, he signed his inheritance to some unknown great-great-grandchild, to be born in the future, and he died shortly afterward. That made his son change his mind, marry soon, have a son named James, and manage the destiny of his other siblings, so they would keep the family dynasty alive for another three generations in order to get the inheritance.&#10;&#10;The family line almost stopped when James's only son David was killed in Vietnam in 1964. His father was forced to remarry, and at the age of 47 he and his new wife Linda had another son, Michael. Michael, now 40, and his wife Jennifer, have two children, Emily, 17, and Jacob, 16, who are the straight heirs of their great-great-grandfather Henry.&#10;&#10;The judicial problem with selecting the right heir for billion-dollar assets is that even though the children have agreed to share the money equally, they still must compete with each other, because legally the inheritance should be given to only one: the smartest child.&#10;&#10;Rules of competition between Emily and Jacob have been set by the board of trustees, who might hold the funds until the contest is over. Emily and Jacob must square off to find the &quot;smartest heir&quot; - by winning the chess-style card game called &quot;The Heirs&quot;.&#10;&#10;DESCRIPTION:&#10;&#10;The pack of genealogical playing cards called &quot;Six Generations&quot; will be used to play &quot;The Heirs&quot;. Instead of using the entire 72 card deck, &quot;The Heirs&quot; will be played with only 32 cards numbered 1 to 5.&#10;&#10;The playing field consists of 32 squares having 4 rows and 8 columns on it. The total playable size of the field is 15&rdquo; x 20&rdquo; (38 x 50 cm.)&#10;&#10;Two players, one of them helping Emily and the other helping Jacob, must open cards placed at random with all their ancestors in four generations and have them join in the thrilling fight for the inheritance.&#10;&#10;All cards with black numbers (men) will help Jacob, and the red cards (women) will help Emily to win. The number on each card represents a generation of relatives in the family.&#10; 2 cards from generation #1 are Emily and Jacob, brother and sister, by themselves.&#10; Generation #2 with also two cards is their parents, Jennifer and Michael.&#10;&#10;Generation #3 - 4 cards &ndash; represents the children&rsquo;s grandparents - Mary, Linda, James and Robert.&#10;&#10;8 cards from generation #4 are their great grandparents - Margaret, Helen, Mildred, Dorothy, George, William, Joseph and John.&#10;&#10;And 16 cards from generation #5 are their 16 great-great grandparents including Henry Smith. Their names are Florence, Minnie, Elizabeth, Lillian, Emma, Marie, Alice, Martha, Henry, Harry, Harold, Edward, Walter, Arthur, Frank and Albert.&#10;&#10;UNDERSTANDING THE GAME:&#10;&#10;According to the story, a family member of the younger generation makes a genealogical search. They then meet in person or find the record of a relative from the same or older generation.&#10;&#10;To get the inheritance, Emily and Jacob must prove their relation to Henry Smith, their great-great grandfather. They need to provide a list of all their 30 ancestors in four older generations as well as prove to trustees that they are the only two surviving heirs among his great-great grandchildren.&#10;&#10;BEFORE STARTING THE GAME, TWO PLAYERS MUST DO THE FOLLOWING:&#10;&#10;1. Decide who will get black cards (men) and who will get red cards (women);&#10;&#10;2. Decide who will start the game first;&#10;&#10;3. Withdraw 40 cards with numbers &quot;6&quot; from the original Six Generations deck, because they are unusable in &quot;The Heirs&quot; card game;&#10;&#10;4. One player must shuffle the remaining 32 cards (with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and place them in random order face down on the board or the desk in four rows and eight columns. No one should see the face of the cards.&#10;&#10;TIP:  During the game try be accurate always keeping the rows and columns with the cards straight.&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;&#10;1. The player can make only one move at a time during the turn.&#10;2. The player who was not able to move a card during his or her turn loses the game.&#10;&#10;NOTES:&#10;&#10;A. If both players are unable to make a move simultaneously, then the player whose turn it is at that time loses the game!&#10;&#10;B. If it is your turn to play but you do not have any card of your color on the board - you lose!&#10;&#10;EACH PLAYER CAN MOVE A CARD IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS:&#10;&#10;1. The player can simply turn over any card face up. Since there are 32 cards in the game, each player can make at least 16 moves by turning a card face up.&#10;&#10;2. If two cards of the opposite colors (black and red) have already been opened in the previous moves, and they have common border from top, bottom, left or right of each other, then the player whose card has a lower or the same number can replace the card of the opposite color by moving their own card to the other card&rsquo;s square. The replaced card has to be discarded from the game and set aside face down.&#10;&#10;NOTES:&#10;&#10;A.  The same move can be done even if there are several empty squares between the two cards.&#10;&#10;B.  The cards should not replace each other if they are attached only by the corners.&#10;&#10;C.  Card #1 can replace any card of the opposite color. Card #2 can replace cards from #2 to #5 of the opposite color. Card #3 can replace cards from #3 to #5 of the opposite color. Card #4 can replace cards #4 and #5 of the opposite color. Card #5 can replace only card #5 of the opposite color.&#10;&#10;D.  A player whose cards are red can replace only black cards with red cards. A player who is playing with black cards can replace only a red card with a black card.&#10;&#10;E.  During this move the player does not need to open any new card.&#10;&#10;F.  If there are one or more combinations on the board when one card may replace another card, the player can either choose any combination or can ignore them all and instead open a new card.&#10;&#10;G.  The players should not review the discarded cards after the move is done.&#10;&#10;H.  If all the cards have been opened already, replacing the correct bordering card becomes the only option for the player.&#10;&#10;3. The player can make a move as a combination of moves #1 and #2. If the player has opened a new card which borders with a card of the opposite color from the top, bottom, left or right, (which has already been opened), and if one of those cards, which belongs to the player, can replace the other card, then the player can immediately replace another card in the same move.&#10;&#10;NOTES:&#10;&#10;A.  This move can be done only between a few cards, one of which is a newly opened card.&#10;&#10;B.  If the player decided to open a new card, but there were possibilities of replacing one or more cards on the board before the new card has been opened, those opportunities would be lost and may not be executed during the same move.&#10;&#10;GAME STRATEGIES:&#10;&#10;- The most important is to save moves for yourself for the end of the game, and to take this opportunity away from the other player.&#10; - Save and protect the cards with the more powerful, lower numbers (like &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;2&rdquo;) because they will help you to make more moves at the end.&#10; - Try to block other players&rsquo; best cards inside the cards with the same color so they will not be movable.&#10; - Leave the other players&rsquo; best cards alone on one row or a column, not letting them make any moves.&#10; - As soon as you start memorizing the cards which have been replaced and discarded, and start predicting all the possible moves of the other player and yourself, (usually at the end of the game) you will be at the right place to win. Your memory is your helper.&#10;&#10;GOOD LUCK! And don't mess with the cards, neither cheat or misplace them. The trustee is watching you... You have only one chance to play the game and win if you want to become Henry Smith&rsquo;s heir!&#10;&#10;The rules and the board to play &quot;The Heirs&quot; are available for copying and printing at www.sixgenerations.com.&#10;&#10;ISBN: 0976041804&#10;    MSRP: $8.97&#10;&#10;",

The player with highest value in cash and prizes after a predetermined number of rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is a faithful reproduction of the short-lived game show hosted by George Fenneman, although it is sometimes referred to as Surprise Package due to the &quot;Your&quot; on the cover being very small.&#10;&#10;",
