    "Description": "Hitman was created by Roman Meilinger as a senior project for Greer Middle College Charter High School in Taylors, SC. Three major companies have caused corruption and crime in Blazer City, and a group of law students have witnessed their crimes and aim to shut the companies down. However, the companies' bosses have hired hitmen to discard of any loose ends that are of risk to their reputation. The game has two different kinds of players with different goals and gameplay. Targets are trying to collect evidence to prosecute companies while they avoid being eliminated by the hitmen. Hitmen try to earn money by eliminating the targets before they are able to prosecute the companies that hired them. Each player is given unique advantages through a contact card that is dealt to them at the beginning of the game, and players must complete dice objectives during the game to perform actions like dueling, interrogating, prosecuting, and lock-picking gates. An alternate version of the game allows hitmen to steal evidence instead of eliminating players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to collect resources, improve your nation, and go on raids, all the while exploring new territory, warring on other nations, trading goods, and establishing your presence in Year 57.&#10;&#10;The flow of the game is built around gaining 'Resources', which are used to purchase 'Recipes'. These Recipes give your peoples new 'Nation Strengths' which can then be used to go on 'Raids'. 'Raids' are worth victory points at the end of the game. In addition to 'Raids', you can also excavate to collect 'Artifacts'. Different sets of these will also be worth victory points at the end of the game. In addition to collecting and purchasing cards, a large aspect of the game is discarding the 'Recipes' you've built, as each one has a unique effect that can be used AT ANY TIME. That's right, in this game you can immediately discard recipes and use effects out of turn, constantly attacking and defending against the other players with effects such as 'Gain a Victory Point', 'Cause Immediate End of Turn', or even 'Swap Hands with Another Player'.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the summer of 1863, in the aftermath of the Gettysburg and Vicksburg campaigns, battles on land and sea were fought over control of the birthplace of the Confederacy, Charleston, South Carolina. A Union victory here would send an unmistakable signal to the states in rebellion as well as the rest of the world that the Confederacy&rsquo;s cause was lost and further fighting a waste of lives and effort.&#10;&#10;A Confederate victory in the face of the tremendous Union host, that included every Union Ironclad on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, as well as some of the most seasoned regiments that numbered among them the first formations of all Black soldiers (free US citizens as well as former slaves), would signify the war would go on and that two nations, not one, could be the result of this &ldquo;second&rdquo; American Revolution.&#10;&#10;Players in A Gate of Hell: The Campaign for Charleston, July-September 1863 are cast in the roles of the historical commanders of the campaign; Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard for the Confederate defenders of Charleston, or Admiral Dahlgren and General Quincy Adams Gillmore of the Union. Can you do as well or better than they?&#10;&#10;A Gate of Hell uses an interactive design to portray this decisive battle of the American Civil War. Players use &ldquo;military support points&rdquo; (MSPs), representing the logistical and political support for the campaign, to mobilize and support their forces (ground and naval) on one of the most inhospitable battlegrounds of the war. Both sides have a variety of military assets to deploy, but the planning and effective use of MSPs throughout the game will determine in large measure who is the victor. Units represent mostly regiments for the ground units, and each ironclad for the naval units. All of the famous batteries and forts, including Sumter and Wagner, are portrayed.&#10;&#10;Rules cover Assault and Bombardment combats, multiple activations, the effects of battles elsewhere that can influence the actions at Charleston, the Union&rsquo;s &ldquo;Swamp Angel&rdquo;, as well as the early completions of the Confederate ironclad Charleston and submarine Hunley.&#10;&#10;Three scenarios are in included. One is on the April 1863 naval offensive by all of the Union ironclads that sought to defeat the rebels' fortresses and is an excellent single-turn introduction to the game&rsquo;s naval combat rules. A second is another single-turn scenario on the initial Union assault on Morris Island and Battery Wagner. These single-turn scenarios take under an hour to game, and are well-suited for tournament play. The third covers the entire campaign and that takes about 6 hours to complete.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A highly addictive reasoning game that is not bound by a board and can be played anywhere on a flat surface. Players take turns adding a picture tile to the existing grid of logical connections. When adding a tile, the player must state aloud the reason for the connection (ie. &quot;butterfly connects to airplane because both fly&quot; or &quot;sapling connects to chick because both are young members of their species&quot;). The other players decide if they consider the connection logical and thus acceptable. If the players disagree with a stated connection, it cannot be played.&#10;&#10;The more connections a tile can make when placed, the more points it is worth. A tile that connects to one tile is worth one point, connecting to two tiles is worth five points, and three or four tiles connected is worth 10 points. The tile placed must logically relate to all the tiles to which it connects. Connections can be made based on function (used for, used by), sharing the same characteristics (color, shape, size, materials, etc.), &quot;has-a&quot; relationship (&quot;train has windows&quot;), causal reasoning (caused by, leads to), or reasoning based on science facts (&quot;ball and feather both float on water&quot; or &quot;butterfly sleeps in blades of grass&quot;).&#10;&#10;The game offers two levels of play. For an easier, faster game, play only with the 58 red tiles. For a longer, more challenging game, add the 30 blue tiles. Two magic wand tiles act as wild cards, becoming whatever the player names them to be when placed. The game ends when there are no more tiles to be placed and the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;The box contains 90 wooden tiles, four wooden tile racks, cloth bag, score pad, answer booklet, and instructions for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;",

These battles give us agood look at the Greco-Macedonian military system in action against Rome. However, before Tarentum called in King Pyrrhus to battle the Romans in southern Italy, this Greek city-state had summoned a number of other Greek condotiere to fight the barbarian tribes of the interior - the piratical Apulians, the fierce Lucanians, the savage Bruttians, the mighty Samnites and the stalwart Romans. The Greek soldiers of fortune who answered her call hailed from many directions - Epirus to the esat, Sparta to the southeast and Syracuse to the southwest. The Hellenistic armies they led were similar in composition, but not indentical. Each mercenary captain brouht a core of troops from his homeland, supplemented by large mercenary forces drawn from the Adriatic and Ionian shores, the levies of Tarentum and tge Italiot League and occasionnally friendly Italian tribes. They were not altogether unsucessful, but none managed to achieve permanent r&eacute;sultats. This survey of foreign Greek armies battling to preserve Magna Graecia in the late Fourth Century BC will be presented in two parts. The battles presented provide an interesting mis of clashing military systems: the Hellenistic combined arms army versus a number of barbarian tribes, Samnite cohorts and even the legions of Rome. Part I begins with the campaigns of King Alexander I Molossus of Epirus.&quot;&#10;&#10;- The Battle of Sipontum, 334 BC. (Epirotes VS Apulians)&#10;- The Battle of Consentia, 333 BC.

The first player of the round removes one dark blue token at random, looking at the value if desired. Players then take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, you must jump a token over an adjacent token or a line of two adjacent tokens onto an empty space. After jumping, the player claims the firstmost token that they jumped. If a player claims a dark blue token, they take another turn immediately. The round ends once no more jumps can be made, then players tally their score. Once all players have been first player once, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;In solo play, you compete for the highest score possible.&#10;&#10;Skip55 also includes arithmetic cards &mdash; four each of +, -, &times;, and &divide; &mdash; that can be used as a variant. Shuffle these cards, then place them face down. After a player claims a token, they draw the top card from the deck, then place it to the right of their token. At game's end, you calculate your score by summing your score from left to right, using the mathematical symbols to combine your numbers. (Use the absolute value of a result following division, e.g., 11&divide;3 = 3.666, which would be 3.)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gameplay revolves around a central play area called &ldquo;The Kingdom.&rdquo; At any given time, the kingdom may be filled with rich natural resources ripe for the taking; however, vicious, marauding monsters also roam the kingdom, bringing even more chaos to the tumultuous landscape.&#10;&#10;Catch the Eye of the King!&#10;&#10;Much to the benefit of the many lords and ladies vying for the throne, a contact within the castle keeps them apprised of the king&rsquo;s current state-of-mind. This is represented by the yellow &ldquo;whims&rdquo; cards. There&rsquo;s always a whim in play, ensuring that the lords and ladies have a definite goal to accomplish, but King Rolphius, the Jester-King, the Fickle, the Whimsical, is aptly named. The king&rsquo;s whims change constantly, and the courtiers must be ready to adjust their goals and tactics at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&#10;&#10;While some of the king&rsquo;s whims are fulfilled by the use of shrewd planning and cunning gameplay, others rely on a distinctly different set of skills...&#10;&#10;Gather Your Allies!&#10;&#10;Because taking over lands and combating monsters can be dirty, dangerous work, the lords and ladies of the kingdom rely upon their houses&rsquo; faithful followers to do their bidding. These &ldquo;units,&rdquo; as we call them, are sent forth to bring glory and attention to their lord or lady. Each turn, the lords and ladies draw cards from the player deck in hopes of recruiting the right kind of unit for the job at hand. Since a unit can only interact with other cards of the same color, the lords and ladies must exhibit much cunning when ordering their units about.&#10;&#10;Since the turmoil in the kingdom has caused the lords and ladies to become a bit more territorial, it has also become important for the courtiers to carefully guard their lands. That&rsquo;s why all lords and ladies are wise to assign some of their bold units as guards. You wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone making off with that nice little piece of forest, would you?&#10;&#10;Units, at least those with the mettle to do so, can also venture forth to do battle with the menagerie of prowling monsters that roam the kingdom...&#10;&#10;In Whims, units are used for multiple purposes. As the kingdom is explored and new lands appear, enterprising units can claim territory for their lord or lady. If things in the kingdom begin to feel a bit too chummy (or a particular lord or lady feels particularly churlish), units can also be used to attack enemy guards and capture the lands of opposing courtiers.&#10;&#10;Send Forth the Hordes!&#10;&#10;In Whims, monsters defeated by plucky units are captured and become part of the lord or lady&rsquo;s &ldquo;horde.&rdquo; Each type of monster has a special knack for mischief, and throughout the course of the game, the lords and ladies will send their hordes forth to cause mayhem to inconvenience and hamper their opponents. Much different from standard units, the monsters in a lord or lady&rsquo;s horde add a new layer of strategy and chaos to the game.&#10;&#10;Simple, Engaging Gameplay&#10;&#10;We feel that you should spend more time playing a game than referring to a rulebook, so Whims gameplay revolves around simple, intuitive mechanics.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player plays up to two cards from a hand of four.  These cards, usually units like peasants, soldiers, and knights, offer several interesting gameplay choices. As mentioned above, players can use their units to capture land from the kingdom, battle monsters, assault enemy units, or capture unguarded land from opponents. Interactions between cards are simply resolved by comparing colors (there are four of them) and numbers.&#10;&#10;The game also includes some special units whose abilities affect the game in other ways, adding depth and surprise to the game.&#10;&#10;Additionally, during a player&rsquo;s turn, he or she can choose to discard a monster or monsters from his or her horde to activate their abilities.&#10;&#10;Certain cards, like the Shield, can be played out-of-turn.  These cards allow cunning (or mean-spirited) players to throw surprise wrenches into their opponents&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The blockchain (also known as &quot;the trust protocol&quot;) is a technology that aims at decentralization as a security measure. It is &quot;an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and verifiably and permanently&quot;. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.&#10;&#10;In BlockChain: The Dice Game, players will use cards to represent fundamental processes for calculating and validating a BlockChain block. Cards, for example, allow you to move dice from the stack (main dice queue) to its board; or increment or decrement one of the dice you are using. Each block has a value to be validated, where subsequent blocks have values &#226;&#128;&#139;related to the previous blocks.&#10;&#10;In some situations, players will use the cards to participate in the validation of a block made by another player. To do this, they needed to spend part of their tokens (representing the cost of processing that data) and became part of the validation pool of that block. One of the most common examples is the use of the PUSH card, where the player can &quot;push&quot; his dice to the board of another player.&#10;&#10;For each block validated, players are given tokens for validating the block or for having helped validate it. At the end of the fourth block validation, the player with the most tokens wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The 10 new Missions utilize 3 new tiles containing zones already filled with Mold. That means extra Xeno spawning, and a more imminent threat of the base being lost for good. These Mold zones also feature glowing pods of an altered form of Xenium, which may be fired at causing a Hellfire explosion! As dangerous as that sounds, it may be used for our advantage, if we're careful.&#10;&#10;This dilapidated base is also under threat of a new type of Abomination we call the Juggernaut. This thing is as ugly as it is unstoppable. Upgrading your weapon won't work, concentrating your fire won't work. I guess we'll just need to lure it into one of those sensitive Pod zones.&#10;&#10;Black Squad brings some of its own elite equipment to the mission, including the hard-hitting XN35 &quot;Crawley&quot; Bot, the devastating Meteor Sentry Gun (a rail gun that can hit multiple zones), and an arsenal of powerful Starting Equipment and other gear.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Let Them Eat Shrimp: Fish Friends promotional pack adds a splash of variety to the original Let Them Eat Shrimp. The pack has 1 instructional card plus 5 fish friend cards. At the start of a player's turn, he or she uses one of the friends' special powers and then turns the card over. After all 5 friends' powers have been used, the cards are turned face-up again, and players may then use the powers again. The choice of powers, all of which provide the player with a unique ability, adds a new and interesting decision to each turn: should I use the Orca to help me combat the shark, the Jellyfish to place the tile point-to-point, the Dolphin to switch one of my tiles, the Clam to place an additional tile, or the Octopus to place a tile anywhere on the board?&#10;&#10;",

If any player writes the same answer as another, both of them score points. The two cards with words change every turn, so the playing experience is full of surprises and never repeats. Once a player has 25 points or more, the game is over. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Perfect for playing with younger family members, or for those of you who would prefer to make tactical decisions rather than look up a rule, Cornered Wolf provides everything you need for infantry, weapon teams, vehicles, multi-level buildings and suppression.&#10;&#10;These rules cover the basic infantryman armed with AK-47 or AK-74, RPG, SVD sniper rifle or PKM. Weapon Teams like the AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher, NSV heavy machine gun, 'fagot' anti-tank missile and mortars are also covered.&#10;&#10;Rules for vehicles cover the BTR-80, BMP-1 / BMP-2, ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 2K22 Tunguska, T-72 / T-80 and MT-LB.&#10;&#10;While the basis of this game is kept simple (No markers or tokens needed!), extended rules are provided for players to introduce more detail. Extended rules allow troops to ride along inside (and on top of) vehicles, while extended wounding rules allow carrying wounded and loading them into vehicles. Evacuating wounded could potentially save you some points with regards to completing your mission objective.&#10;&#10;A points system is also provided for those who aren't too keen on randomly generated forces, although we strongly recommend at least trying the random generation as it makes for very interesting and still quite balanced games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Today, a &ldquo;marathon&rdquo; is a long race&mdash;possibly of 26 miles or so but often different. Or it may be a long session of doing something&mdash;nearly anything. There are &ldquo;movie marathons&rdquo; and &ldquo;shopping marathons&rdquo; and many other kinds, all picking off a word that means &ldquo;long distance&rdquo; or &ldquo;long term.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;But originally the word was the name of a small Greek village and applied to the plain nearby&mdash;a plain noteworthy for being a good place where hundreds of Persian ships could offload thousands of Persian troops and let them get organized, before proceeding the distance to Athens and burning the city in revenge for the Athenians supporting a rebellion against Darius I.  It was a place where, oddly enough, two armies confronted each other for FIVE days with almost no fighting, and Athenian democracy was put to the test as the Greek forces debated (and voted) whether or not to attack the Persians, finally reaching the affirmative only after seeing most of the Persian cavalry reloaded onto ships for use&hellip;somewhere probably unpleasant for Athens.&#10;&#10;&#10;As to the battle itself, numbers are uncertain but we know the Greeks were heavily outnumbered. We know also that the two armies&rsquo; fighting style and equipment were near opposites, with Greeks depending on shields, armor, and close-quarter fighting and Persians depending on missile weapons and skirmishing. It seems pretty clear that the Greek army ran (or advanced at speed) as soon as they got within bow range, to reduce the time they would endure arrows without being able to retaliate. And it seems pretty clear that, once the Greek army closed with the Persians (who had no room to withdraw and maintain a firing distance) that the battle would be a slaughter. It was.&#10;&#10;At under two hours of play time, you can make your own explorations into this battle without scheduling &ldquo;marathon game sessions&rdquo; in order to play.  You&rsquo;ll be able to quickly try various strategies and see what differences you can make on the outcome.  Units active by chit-pull per formations and combat includes both melee and ranged fire. Leadership and morale matter (in several ways) and combat results use step reduction and several levels of unit deterioration.&#10;&#10;The game offers a historical set-up scenario plus variants for both set up and reinforcements.  With the variants, it&rsquo;s possible that the Spartans may finally show up to the battle!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Born half-Roman, but all business, this battle saw &ldquo;the last great Roman general&rdquo;, Aetius, at his finest!  And &ldquo;finest&rdquo; would mean both political maneuvering with shifting alliances as well as tactical finesse.&#10;&#10;The build-up to the Battle of Ch&acirc;lons (also called the &ldquo;Battle of the Cataulnian Plains&rdquo;) is incredibly complex, and no one is certain which parts are actually true. Certainly much of the &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; of the Late Roman Empire were fierce peoples&mdash;Vandals, Goths, Alans, etc&mdash;who were fleeing from the even-fiercer Huns.  But Hunnish leaders like Attila, were far more than merely brutal, playing alliances, taking advantage of the deaths of neighboring leaders, and playing both Eastern and Western Romans as clients and victims.  The Roman leader, Aetius, had Hunnish warriors fighting FOR him in earlier battles, and spent time with both the Huns and Goths as a honored hostage (learning much about both peoples while there.)  In fact, his father was a Roman general of &ldquo;Scythian&rdquo; origin, one of the original groups of powerful mounted nomads, so you could say he was closer to his allies and adversaries than most Roman commanders of the day, which is one reason he was one of the most influential men in the Western empire for over 20 years.&#10;&#10;Attila had spent time &ldquo;visiting&rdquo; various parts of both East and West, but taken home more loot from the East and decided there must be riper pickings in the West. Adding much of Gaul to his empire and plundering the rest looks to have been his aim, but his movements suggest as much opportunism as strategy.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;two&rdquo; armies involved at Ch&acirc;lons were a varied hodge-podge of peoples, with the &ldquo;Hun&rdquo; side including various Goths, Alans, Burgundians, Rugians, Franks, Thuringians, and many more. The &ldquo;Allied&rdquo; side was primarily Visigoth and &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; (which would be a broad mix of peoples in the same uniforms) but also included various Celtic and German tribes, Romano-Britons and their own allies of Franks, Alans, and Burgundians.&#10;&#10;Now, you can apply those multi-faceted armies against each other in a way that really shows off their diversity. The Battle of Ch&acirc;lons game uses full-sized cards for each unit (rather like our Battle of Arbela game by the same designer). Each card has all the information you need for movement, activation, combat, and morale. Players set up their best available deployments to execute their strategies and win the game (if the gods of fortune smile!). Your leaders allow activations and assist in combat. Some troops may make choices other than what the commanders might have wished (and that can work out well or otherwise). It&rsquo;s all part of presenting this chaotic game in a timely and playable fashion.&#10;&#10;A full battle will last 60 to 120 minutes. And then you can swap sides and try it again! Ch&acirc;lons comes with full-sized, coated playing cards, a sheet of information counters, playing field diagram, dice, and all the rules you need.&#10;&#10;Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series. That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It might be the most written about battle of all time&hellip; but tactically, it was one of Napoleon&rsquo;s worst efforts.&#10;&#10;After Napoleon&rsquo;s return from Elba, he watched his peace efforts spurned and knew that four large armies would eventually invade France.  In a precarious position at home as well, he elected to move quickly, hoping for a powerful spoiling attack against the two closest armies that would rally some of his former allies and, even better, encourage the &ldquo;Seventh Coalition&rdquo; to negotiate.&#10;&#10;His movements with the Arm&eacute;e du Nord shocked both Wellington and Blucher and hinted at the old brilliance of mind.  But when it came to the battles&hellip; it seemed the imagination was no longer there. Ligny was a bludgeoning match, Quatre Bras a lost opportunity and bad staff work and communications caused failure at both.  Dispensing a third of his army to &ldquo;chase Bl&uuml;cher&rdquo; (without Grouchy managing to find him), he took the rest to deal with &ldquo;the Sepoy General&rdquo; that he at least pretended to disdain.  Wellington expected a flanking attack (and 25% of his troops missed the actual battle in preparation for it). What he got was &ldquo;a pounding match.&rdquo;  Though he had claimed his troops made up &ldquo;an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff,&rdquo; they bore the brunt of the best Napoleon could throw at them for 8 hours and turned the tide.&#10;&#10;And yet, it served as the completely final end to over 20 years of near-constant warfare, in one of the few periods in Western history defined by a single person&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;The Napoleonic Era.&rdquo;  And may be the most written-about battle in history.&#10;&#10;Designer Ed Wimble has focused solely on the 24 hours of June 18th, 1815. Leadership and morale are key, while tactical ability and artillery bombardment are both highlighted. It is, after all, a pounding match. The game includes both basic and optional rules, with the opportunity to test some variables regarding smarter troop dispositions or operational planning, as well as giving the French the opportunity to begin the battle sooner (and deal with more severe mud).&#10;&#10;The game offers a historical set-up scenario plus variants for both set up and reinforcements.  With the variants, it&rsquo;s possible that Grouchy may fully live up to Napoleon's order to pursue the Prussians and fatally delay their appearance on the battlefield!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each region of the battlefield is resolved in turn, so you must fight in them one at a time by placing domino tiles that represent your army's strength.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player shuffles their colored domino army tiles face down, then draws a hand of five tiles, keeping them behind their screen. On a turn, each player reveals one domino, with the strength of a domino equalling the summed numbers on it. Whoever played the weakest domino places it into the region first, then the player of the next weakest domino places that, etc. In the case of a tie, the tied dominos are placed after all other dominoes that turn.&#10;&#10;The region under question is a 5x5 space on the playing area, with the central square being occupied by a castle. No domino can be placed over the castle. The first domino placed in a region must be placed adjacent to a castle, and each subsequent domino placed can be placed adjacent to the castle or next to any other domino as long as they have the same number in at least one adjacent edge. For example, a 2|5 tile could be placed next to a 4|5 tile, or the tiles could be placed perpendicular to one another as long as the 5s are adjacent.&#10;&#10;Once all the dominoes are placed, the next turn begins with players refilling their hands, then playing another domino. A player cannot play outside the 5x5 area unless it's impossible to play all of the domino inside it.&#10;&#10;Once the region is filled, you consider the total strength of each player in each row and column in the region, using colored markers to indicate who has the highest total. If two colors are tied for highest, then they're ignored and the next highest color wins the row or column. If the totals are completely tied, then no one wins that row or column. Whoever wins the most rows and columns wins the region, placing a marker of their color on the castle. Again, in the case of a tie, they're ignored and the next highest color wins the region!&#10;&#10;Whoever first wins two regions wins the game. If in a four-player game each player wins one region, then the tie is broken by whoever won the most rows and columns.&#10;&#10;",

The deck also contains six multicolored cards from 1-6.&#10;&#10;After the cards are dealt out, the first player in the game lays down one or more cards; if they play more than one card, then the cards must be all the same color and they must either match in number or be in sequential order. The next player can play something higher than what was played initially with higher numbers outranking lower ones, and red outranking yellow, which outranks blue. A multicolor card played first on its own is worse than blue; played after a single card, it's considered to be the same color as what it's following.&#10;&#10;The 1s can be played on 6s without needing to play more cards to outrank the current hand, so a blue 1 beats a red 6.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either plays or passes. Once everyone passes, the last player to have played leads something new, and play continues until someone empties their hand of cards, thereby scoring points equal to what other players still have in hand. These rounds are repeated until someone scores at least 50 points.&#10;&#10;",

Dirt Track Saturday Night is the game of Sprint Car, Supermodified and Stock Racing on dirt ovals which take place all over America. You set up your car to be tuned for the track conditions. Tracks can be wet and mushy all the way to dry and abrasive with other conditions in between. Choose your gear ratios, suspension setting and tire selection and your wing angle if the car has one; then go like hell. The playing surface is a three foot by four foot rectangle. You can buy and print pre-made tracks or make your own living diorama with the information provided in the rules. Included in the rules are all the charts you'll need to run a single race or, one night of racing where you have to do well in order to make it into the feature event, or run a full season of events to determine the winner of the season championship. &#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;On their turn, players roll two d6, which determines how far they can move. They can move one more space beyond what they are entitled to move, but doing so carries a chance of spinning out and/or crashing. Maneuvers can be performed to pass other racers, but the more fancy the maneuver, the more likely the car will not successfully execute it. Players must fight to gain and maintain the lead for 6 laps, after which the winner is determined. &#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Prelude to War: Europe 1936-1939 is a detailed historical simulation game, for three players, that recreates the political, diplomatic and military maneuvering that preceded the outbreak of the Second World War.&#10;&#10;The players take on the roles of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Western democracies of France and the United Kingdom.&#10;They advance their goals through diplomacy, intimidation, agitation, appeasement, pacts, economic warfare, rearmament, minor country dispute arbitration, multilateral conferences, political consolidation... The German and Soviet factions may also conduct territorial annexations, partitions, or military invasions.&#10;&#10;The game is card-assisted but not card-driven. The design postulate is one of rigorous historical accuracy, and explores in great detail the chain of events that lead to the pivotal international crises, the inner workings behind their resolution and the various aspects of their consequences, as well as the prominent domestic issues faced by each faction.&#10;&#10;The diplomatic wrangling and muscle-flexing between the major powers is translated into a &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; mechanism where players stake national pride and international credibility until one side caves in, or the escalation culminates in a final &ldquo;test of nerves&rdquo; that determines the victor. The resolution of these challenges does not involve any dice rolling and is essentially a mind game based on bluff and risk-management: the higher the escalation, the greater the cost for the loser (in terms of international prestige, national self-confidence, and support at home for the regime). Cards and hidden chits provide a realistic degree of uncertainty and limited intelligence.&#10;&#10;Turns are seasonal, counter density is very low, the action is fast-paced and very interactive.&#10;&#10;A detailed, historically contextualized After Action Report can be found on the game's page on the Legion Wargames website.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As soon as the 6 cards per player are distributed, you may add the monster cards of your choice to the game deck. The more monsters you include, the more the game will be tense and difficult.&#10;&#10;As you are playing, if a monster shows up in a permanent challenge, no other monster can be played until the first one is defeated.&#10;&#10;How to fight a monster?&#10;&#10;In the card, on the upper right side, you will have an indication of the number of Monster tokens associated with the Brawl Card.&#10;&#10;Place the corresponding number of tokens next to the Monster Card. As soon as a player engages in battle with a monster, he will roll the dice needed to overcome the challenge indicated. If he is successful, the player will take a token and place it next to him. If he is more successful than necessary - by means of having other players participate in the fight - he will take a Monster token for every successful roll of the dice. In union, there is strength! Keeping in mind that there is a very handy Cheap Shot Card you can use to &ldquo;invite&rdquo; the other players into your fight!&#10;&#10;If even after a successful attempt the Monster is not dead, his card is placed in the permanent challenge along with all his remaining tokens. If there was already another permanent challenge card in place, the Monster Brawl Card is placed on top of it. The other permanent challenge can only be played if the Monster is defeated for good! In case of defeat, the player takes the effects of the defeat and places the Monster Card in the permanent challenge pile.&#10;&#10;If a monster is placed in permanent challenge, he will calmly stay there until we engage him, even if he was previously injured.&#10;The player with the most Monster tokens will win the Monster Card once the creature is defeated.

There are easy and intermediate questions, so every member will be able to participate and learn something new. Players can even get rich by building up their own game farm while learning about the bush. Animal Kingdom was developed to get families and friends to interact and to show everyone how wonderful African wildlife is and how important it is for us to preserve and nurture what we have.&#10;&#10;Players move along several intersecting tracks on a map of Africa, taking actions depending on which type of location they land on. Various actions spots allow player to answer trivia questions about African wildlife, gain or lose money (themed as various types of wildlife for their own game farm), or encounter unexpected events.

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Do you think of yourself as an empathetic person? Are you good at reading other people&rsquo;s feelings and emotions? Then Empatia is right for you! In Empatia you&rsquo;ll try to guess what other players like, and what is not their cup of tea. Empatia is a game filled with marvelous eerie illustrations &ndash; and your task is to find among them the ones that other players like the best. You have to empathize with them to choose correctly; you have to discover why they like a given picture more than the others &ndash; Is it the colors? Shapes? The person in the middle? A cute animal? Empatia is not a game for the cold-hearted, that&rsquo;s for sure!&#10;&#10;- What&rsquo;s in the box? 68 large-sized cards with illustrations; 12 cards with numbers; 6 plastic diamonds; 1 cardboard scoring sheet; 6 wooden player tokens; 36 cardboard tokens; rulebook&#10;- Beautiful and magical artwork&#10;- Easy-to-learn rules&#10;- 2 game modes &ndash; competitive and cooperative&#10;&#10;Gameplay (basic version):&#10;&#10;Each player has 6 cards in their hands. One player will be the judge of the round and gets rid of one card of which he thinks he will not need during the next rounds. His fellow players all choose one card (or two if there are only two or three players) they think the judge will like most. The judge shuffles the cards. All pictures are then shown face up. The fellow players try and guess which two cards the judge likes most (and which of these two is the absolute top) and get points according to the accuracy of their guesses. The first player to get 30 points wins.&#10;&#10;Gameplay (cooperative play)&#10;&#10;Twelve cards are laid face up on the table. The first player must find a key of exactly two words (prepositions and conjunctions don't count) that matches 3 of the cards on the table. The fellow players must then try and find not only those 3 cards, but also in which order the player would line them up (from the one that matches best the key to the one that matches it only better than the 9 remaining cards). The team then gets points according to their answers.&#10;&#10;The purpose is to get most point as a team. According to the number of points reached, you will know how well you know each other.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This WWI German game (the title translates as &quot;Our newest U-boats&quot;) is remarkable not only for its great cover and board art, but also for having game pieces that represent six specific German U-boats.&#10; Players roll and move alone a 100-space track from Helgoland around the UK and Ireland and back home. 20 English flag stickers wrapped around pins are placed in the 18 black spaces(three in number 6); each of these represents a historical sinking of a British ship. The first player to land on each black space collects its flag(s). Another 18 red-colored spaces represent events that force players to move forward or back along the track. The winner is the player who returns home with the most flags (first player home wins a tie).&#10;&#10;The six metal U-boat pieces are numbered U-8, U-9, U-21, U-28, U-29 and U-45. According to Wikipedia, each has a notable history:&#10;&#10;U-8: Sank 5 British ships on Feb. 23-24, 1915, then was trapped in nets and sunk by gunfire on March 4.&#10;&#10;U-9: Sank the &ldquo;Live Bait Squadron&rdquo;, three Cressy-class armoured cruisers (HMS Cressy, Aboukir, Hogue), on Sept. 22, 1914 (space number 6 on the track), protected cruiser HMS Hawke on Oct. 15, 13 British merchant ships and one Russian naval vessel by Nov. 1915. Withdrawn for training use in April 1916. It was the only U-boat to be awarded an Iron Cross by Kaiser Wilhelm II.&#10;&#10;U-21: One of the first U-boats to be equipped with diesel engines (U19 class). First submarine to sink a ship with a self-propelled torpedo on Sept. 5, 1914, destroying the cruiser HMS Pathfinder off the Firth of Forth. Transferred to the Mediterranean to support the Turks in early 1915, sinking British battleships HMS Triumph and HMS Majestic off Gallipoli, as well as French navy vessel Amiral Charner in Feb. 1916. Transferred to the Austrian navy for a time to attack Italian shipping, then back to Germany for unrestricted commerce war in March 1917. Retired for training in 1918. Merchant victims included 13 British, 7 Italian, 6 Dutch, 4 Norwegian, 2 French, 2 Russian, 2 Portuguese and 1 Swedish ships (2 damaged, rest sunk).&#10;&#10;U-28: Sank 40 ships during five patrols, starting with British steamer Iberian on July 30, 1915. Was sunk on its final patrol after torpedoing British steamer Olive Branch, which exploded and fatally damaged U-28 in turn. No survivors.&#10;&#10;U-29: Sank 4 and damaged 2 merchant ships during March 1915. Rammed and sunk by HMS Dreadnought in Pentland Firth on Mar. 18, the only submarine to be sunk by a battleship.&#10;&#10;U-45: Sank 27 and damaged 1 ship between 27 April 1916 and 24 July 1917. Sunk by Royal Navy submarine D7 on 12 Sept. 1917.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Iraqi units are not included, as the challenges the Allies faced advancing into Iraq and Kuwait are represented by a &quot;C3I&quot; die-roll to move mechanism of increasing difficulty as Allied units advance, reach key phase lines, and attempt to occupy up to 10 objectives on the map within four one-day turns (a fifth turn may be enabled by die-roll). Primarilly designed for solo play, up to three players can seperately maneuver the three main Allied higher commands: XVIII Corps, VII Corps, and the Allied and Marine joint task forces.&#10;&#10;Reaching historical objectives will result in an Allied operational victory (taking about 6 objectives).  Players may explore, at the risk of adverse &quot;pol-mil effects&quot; rolls, reaching additional objectives that offer prospects for a strategic victory.  As a quick set-up, quick-playing game, the player can readily replay history to explore chances for a different, historical, better (or worse) outcome to the last great ground offensive of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;",

Options exist to also play as a pair of racers racing against other pairs, demolition derby and a fun version affectionately called Puzzle Racer Turbo.&#10;&#10;In Championship Mode however, the player takes the role of a fresh faced racer from one of the factions and as the campaign progresses, the pilot gains Championship Points to spend on upgrading their pilot, ship or garage.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players activate their racer and make a simple race action followed by up to 3 manoeuvres and then a trick. A typical player turn takes minutes and every action is a balance of risk vs. reward. This creates a straight forward but fast paced balanced game that suits gamers that like a game that can be played quickly as a fun 30 minute blast or by players that want a more tactical game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes turns rolling their polyhedral dice to see if they make the combination and open the locks. If unsuccessful at opening a lock, they arm a trap. They get one more chance to pick the lock, and failure means taking damage!&#10;&#10;Players take turns trying to open their treasure chest, they are not only trying to get treasure, but must also live to the end! Hit points are exchanged for gold at the end of the game. Whoever winds up with the most gold wins! There are also special skills that can be earned to help your rogue achieve success.&#10;&#10;From the designer's webpage&#10;&#10;",
