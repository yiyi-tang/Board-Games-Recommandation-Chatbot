In the shadow of an old palm tree four bold nomad sons are planning a dare-devil adventure. What is their plan? Will they really try to cross the desert by the infamous west route? Don't they know the treacherous quicksand and all those other dangers which lie in wait for them? Have no fear! With cautiousness, good companionship and some luck this route is passable. Each caravan still has one place open - dare this adventure and join them!&#10;&#10;The rules:&#10;Each player has three pawns with which to reach the large oasis in the middle of the board. Pawns are moved by throwing the die. A pawn can get stuck in quicksand, and then has to be rescued by another pawn of the same player. (Optional: or by rolling a six.) A rescued pawn is carried on the back of the other to the next oasis, where the pawn which was stuck has to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the player.&#10;&#10;When a pawn ends its move on a field where another pawn already is, it can climb on the others back, and be carried/ported by it. This is possible with both your own or other players pawns. (Multiply carrying is allowed.) However: a carried pawn should hop off  before reaching the next oasis, as once the porter reaches it, it will drop off all carried pawns in the oasis! And likewise with resting pawns from being stuck in the quicksand: formerly carried pawns will have to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the corresponding player.&#10;&#10;When a pawn ends it turn on a place from which a short track continues (shown by a road sign), this may be taken on the next turn. Any carried pawns are carried along.&#10;To reach the end oasis, a pawn has to reach it, either by throwing the required number exactly or higher.&#10;&#10;Winner of this adventurous journey is the player who has crossed the desert with his or her three pawns first.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Roue Breizh / The Lords of Broc&eacute;liande&quot; is strategy game set during the Dark Ages in the Celtic land of Brittany (the north-west corner of France). In the Breton language &quot;Roue Breizh&quot; means &quot;King of Brittany&quot; (Roue is pronounced &quot;Rou&eacute;&quot;, the old pronunciation of the French word Roi or King). The game comes with an educational booklet setting out the history of what was, to the medieval mind, a mystical land associated with the knights of the Round Table and the legendary forest of Broc&eacute;liande.&#10;&#10;In this game, players play the feudal lords of Brittany who have survived the fall of Rome (or have fled from their original homeland: Britain) and now face barbarian invasions from the sea and the encroachments of the Frankish kingdom from the east. The Breton lords gradually settle and connect up their different domains, establishing towns and defending themselves against the terrible Vikings and Northmen. The aim of the game is to found ever larger baronies, counties and duchies, whether on one's own, or in combination with the domains of an ally. At the end of the game, one of these lords will be crowned King of Brittany: the &quot;Roue Breizh&quot;!&#10;&#10;Mechanisms: Kingdoms are made and unmade, alliances are formed at will. There's no elimination of players. Instead, players are given the chance to form alliances, and may freely give and receive lands as they make or break alliances at the end of each turn. During a turn, members of the same alliance are not allowed to attack each other. Being a member of a strong alliance will allow each player in the alliance to have a better dice-roll in times of conflict. Some players are also members of the Council of Broc&eacute;liande, which gives its members more power, but also - inevitably - the obligation to redistribute resources and to promote the development of other players instead! Gaming enthusiasts will certainly enjoy the fact that &quot;Roue Breizh&quot; gives a decisive advantage to team-play, through the principle of rotating &quot;coalitions&quot;. Between each round of play, the formation and re-formation of teams gives rise to complex interactions between the players as they negotiate the terms of their alliance.&#10;&#10;(This is an amended version of the summary published on the Tric Trac website, in French).&#10;&#10;",

Players will now shudder at the insidious kindness of the Empath, blink in confusion at the antics of the Lunatic, and howl in outrage as their planets are stolen away by the Claw!&#10;&#10;Cosmic Conflict also makes the Cosmos even bigger, adding another player (and attractive black components) to the game. Cosmic Quakes will shake things up, ensuring that no player&rsquo;s hand is truly safe. And as if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, Cosmic Conflict introduces a new variant to the game &ndash; the hazard deck, which confronts the players with dangerous and amusing events that can crop up at any time.&#10;&#10;Hazards are special game-altering conditions that bring exciting effects to your Cosmic Encounter experience. Special destiny cards, drawn during the destiny phase, display a &ldquo;hazard warning&rdquo; in the upper left corner; this indicates that a hazard card should be drawn.&#10;&#10;Consisting of two types (temporary and permanent), these cards have a variety of wild effects. The Energy Fields hazard card, for example, lets each main player draw two free cards... but they must show them to the group first. And the optional &ldquo;Extremely Hazardous Variant&rdquo; will take you on a wild ride; it brings a new hazard card into play every turn!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Krampus,the dark twin to that jolly elf Santa Claus, is tired of his diminished and secondary role in the Christmas holiday, and has booby-trapped Santa's sleigh.  The sleigh has flown off on it's own and now it is a race: Krampus is out to ruin everyone's night by stealing gifts and Santa is trying to retreive the sleigh and deliver the presents.&#10;The board consists of eighteen areas, the north and south poles which are the base points for the Santa and Krumpus players.  The sleigh is placed in the center of the board.  The game includes three dice, hand painted with both numbers and the following symbols:&#10;1,2 :footprints&#10;3,4  :sleigh&#10;5    :a spring&#10;6    :a hand&#10;and on one die, a three is an asterisk, representing a wild face.  The game may be played with normal dice, but one 3 face must be marked to represent the wild symbol.&#10;Setup continues by rolling the dice six times (3d6) and laying cubes that represent the gift targets on the resulting spaces, which are numbered from 3-18 (1 and 2 are the poles, and will never have gift targets placed on them.)&#10;The dice and the player's tokens are manipulated using the dice.  Each turn the player may roll 3 times, keeping a die or two each time.  If a die is kept, it must be used at the end of rolling, there is no deciding to reroll later.  Whatever is rolled on the third roll is kept and used.  &#10;Keep on footprint to move one space, two to move three spaces, and keep three footprints to move four spaces.  Movement is orthogonal only, never diagonal.&#10;Keep one sleigh to move the sleign one space orthogonally, two to move three, three to move hour.  In addition, if the player's token is in the same space as the sleigh, you must roll two sleighs to board the sleigh.  Once on the sleigh, the sleigh is moved with either footprints or sleighs (not a combination of both, though you may wait until the end of the third roll to decide which you will use to move the sleigh.)  Move the sleigh to bring it closer to you, or to keep the other player from intercepting it.  The sleigh may not be moved remotely if the other player is riding it.&#10;Roll and keep three springs to eject a player riding the sleigh back to his or her base.  (In variant play, any gifts on the sleigh at this point remain aboard)  While unlikely, it is possible to eject yourself from the sleigh if you roll all three dice three times and it pops up.  If so, too bad, back to base with yourself!&#10;If on the sleigh and in the same space as a package, roll and keep two hands to deliver the package as Santa or steal the package as the Krampus. In either case, place the package in your base as a point.  &#10;The wild symbol may substitute for any other in the above combinations.&#10;&#10;Winner is player to pick up the most gift tokens when the last one is picked up, ties going to Santa, because it's Christmas, after all.&#10;&#10;Variant Challenge 1: To 'win' a gift and get the point, you must return to your base with it (no roll required to drop it)&#10;&#10;Variant Challenge 2: Use Variant Challenge 1, but the other player may also steal gifts from your base, and the winner is the first to get ALL the gifts.&#10;&#10;",

The Spanish actually declared war first, but no one doubted that the United States was the aggressor; whether said aggression was designed to acquire control over Cuba or liberate the island depended on one&rsquo;s point of view. The small U.S. Regular Army would quickly be joined by tens of thousands of volunteers, who answered the war&rsquo;s signature battle cry &quot;Remember the Maine!&quot; with the less-well-remembered response:&#10;&#10;&quot;To Hell with Spain!&quot;&#10;&#10;To Hell With Spain is a supplement for the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series, based on the battles fought in Cuba and Puerto Rico between June and August 1898. It is not a complete game: ownership of any boxed game in the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series is necessary to provide the rules and markers, and maps are drawn from the following Series: Panzer Grenadier (Avalanche) games and supplements: Elsenborn Ridge, Road to Berlin, Battle of the Bulge, Kokoda Trail, Eastern Front and 1940: The Fall of France. There are 10 scenarios, each based on an actual battle or situation from the Spanish-American War.&#10;&#10;To Hell With Spain is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&rsquo;s components.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wargames Rules for Entire Battles. From Earliest History to 1400 AD.&#10;&#10;A miniatures game for ancient and medieval warfare. The rules use interesting game mechanics, such as random movement rates, to represent the variable nature of warfare in the era it addresses.&#10;&#10;Units are rated by a Unit Cohesion Value (UCV) that takes into account the armor, leadership, and training of the unit. For example, Roman legionaries would have a high UCV due to their better equipment, good leadership, and regular training while barbarian tribesmen would have a lower UCV.&#10;&#10;Combat is divided into shooting, impact, and melee. Unit's abilities are divided into strengths and weaknesses in these areas. For example, a barbarian unit may have a high impact value, meaning that they have a formidable first charge, but their value in an ensuing melee is less imposing.&#10;&#10;The figure scales used for the game is 1:50 (one model figure representing 50 actual men) and the time scale is one turn equals approximately 60 minutes. The game attempts to allow entire ancient battles to be fought out in miniature on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;At the time it was published, Milgamex' &quot;Ancient Warfare&quot; emerged as a potential rival to the popularity of WRG's &quot;Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles.&quot; However, they could not push WRG's rules out of the place they had gained in international competition play. The rules went through two printings, but by 1980, they were difficult to find in stores.&#10;&#10;",

This is not even the real world, as you&rsquo;ve known it until now, at least...This is more&quot;.&#10;&#10;For fifteen years players had to customize their own deck: now, at last, they can customize their cards too!&#10;&#10;Prodigy Game Cards is a card game, you don't collect it, proper for experienced players; every player drives a group of people &quot;special&quot; in it: these people are called WIPper, in specific places around the world, that in order to prevail on the adversaries fight for many purposes.&#10;&#10;These characters, at first sight, seem just common people, but possess increased ability that we called &quot;prodigies.&quot; It is a WIPper who succeeds in these &quot;prodigies&quot;. Who is not able to do it, is without bond. Four types of bond exist and each is represented, in the game, by a different color:&#10;&#10;Molecular - yellow: those people that can modify their phisical structure and their molecular density in different ways.&#10;Elementary - green: they possess the ability to channel, to send forth and to check different types of energy using the body as catalyst.&#10;Feral - red: they possess a combination of Dna human and animal, that allow them to possess animal physical powers.&#10;Psionic - blue: they are the WIPpers that possess some superior mental abilities.&#10;&#10;To play a game of Prodigy Game Cards it needs at least two players. Every player must possess WIPper (the protagonists of our history), Places (where they fight) and a deck of Prodigies (the special actions that are able to do).&#10;&#10;With Prodigy Game Cards you can directly reach a new level of personalization: the Prodigies have  the technology Scracth&amp;Play, developed in collaboration with Cartamundi, that allows the players to personalize, in phase of construction of the deck, every single paper.&#10;&#10;Every Prodigy possesses three levels of power: low, middle and high. &#10;According to the strategy and experience, and according to the objective that the player want to get during the game, he decides what value &quot;to release.&quot; To increase a low value, is necessary to remove the patina that covers the left yellow panel of the paper; to increase the value, without going to far, it is recommended the panel (orange) found to the center; if you need  values of maximum power, it needs to set the right the panel (red) free.&#10;&#10;",

The player takes the side of the U.S./West and must choose one of the offered strategies. Operations include military, diplomatic, and intelligence. Economics have been added and interleaved as an important factor.&#10;&#10;Initial strategy in the Historic game is set and one must follow through with it until allowed to change strategy. This presents both opportunity and difficulty. Terror operations are governed by Random Event and various rules. While the terror side may not seem too active, it's very existence constitutes a tremendous threat to the U.S./Western position in the world. Players will feel the pressure and frustration of achieving the right balance of strategy to means. A half dozen or so different strategies are available to play with.&#10;&#10;The game spans 20 one-year turns, from 2001 to 2021. By the end of this time the U.S. side must either bring off a victory, or lose.&#10;&#10;This is a tough, strange war and the game reflects that reality.&#10;&#10;Download rules, map, counters, etc at http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@153.EuETbiw6OXw.45@.1dd43f4f/0&#10;&#10;",

They were Captain Blackbeard and the Red Corsair. &#10;They salvaged treasures, attacked merchant ships and embarked on many an adventure. Over the years, the par assembled loyal crews and had magic pirate spells which they used to spread terror and fear throughout the civilised world. They were as thick as thieves. As for who was the strongest of the two, no one knew. To decide those once and for all, each pirate kidnapped the beloved lady of the other.&#10;In this exciting duel between two legendary figures, the players take on the roles of Captain Blackbeard and the Red Corsair and each attempt to free their ladies from the clutches of their brother.&#10;The table where the cards are laid represents the sea and its islands. The hand of each player represents their pirate ship, while the cards symbolise the crew or the pirate spells. Which pirate brother will be the first to free his lady from the grasp of his brother?&#10;&#10;Object of the game:&#10;The object of the game is to free your pirate lady from the clutches of your opponent pirate.&#10;The first player whose lady (Lady in Red for the Red Corsair, Lady in Black for Captain Blackbeard) appears on the opponent's discard pile is the winner.&#10;Cards land on the discard pile either by defeating them while fighting on an isle or due to a penalty when the opponent pirates controle one or more of the 4 islands. Care has to be taken on which island your followers should be send as even the strongest pirate has its weaknesses. Furthermore, every island has its own penalties (e.g. discard cards from your hand / discard pile or pirates already on islands) which should be considered.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Several versions of the battle have been produced. Each has been contrived to show a historic resolution, fun for the English player, depressing for the French. Azincourt (French spelling) is a unique approach. The French might have had more coordinated leadership. They might not have been so intent on an easy victory, and as a result been so careless. They might have taken advantage of the vulnerable English advance. They might have waited for the English to wear themselves out crossing the muddy field and allowed Henry to make the first attack. They might have employed their crossbows to better effect. Had they better control of their troops, crowded conditions would not have reduced combat effectiveness. Finally, had they considered avenues for retreating units, disruption of fresh units would not been such a problem.&#10;&#10;In Azincourt I address a number of these what-ifs but, moreover, I offer players the unique mechanic of commanding one flank of each opposing army. In effect players play BOTH the French AND the British. It works out much better than you would expect. Since the English line is necessarily pretty static, there is little problem in coordinating an English defense while splitting command of the French in the face of the enemy mirrors the historically poor French command.&#10;&#10;Azincourt is a card assisted, counter and hex game utilizing large colorful counters and a variety of aids that allows for a key battle component which other versions neglect to emphasize - the capture of nobles for ransom. Integral to Azincourt play is the capture of these nobles, English and French (including King Henry), of varying value. Ah and then there are the complications that such nobles bring. Wounded nobles become easy targets. Captured nobles make targets of their captors. Then there are Henry's terrible archers ... who WILL run out of arrows, and then what? To add to the game's variety is a random set-up and reinforcemnt schedule that toys with a number of possible historical possibilities.&#10;&#10;Playtesting has been a blast so far but continues so no publisher has yet committed. Still, all in good time...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A climbing game played with a standard 52 card deck primarily meant for three players, (though there is a four player variant).  It is similar to &quot;Fight the Landlord&quot; (Dou Di Zhu) but with some noticeable differences - the biggest being that the 3 (not the 2) is the high card, but also in the number of cards in the pot and allowable plays.  Because the runs are relatively limited (4 through K only) and because there are no &quot;bombs&quot; it is a bit more predictable in its gameplay than Dou Di Zhu.&#10;&#10;Each round starts with dealing the cards (except for four of them) and an auction for the remaining cards.  The winner of the auction then picks up the cards and plays against the other two opponents who are now in a temporary partnership.&#10;&#10;The goal for each round is to shed your cards.  The winning bidder needs to shed all his cards first before one of the opposing players sheds all of their cards.  Allowable plays are singles, pairs, triplets, quads and runs of three+ cards and staircases of three+ sets (note that runs/staircases may only involve 4's through K's).  There are no &quot;bombs&quot;.&#10;&#10;If the high bidder wins, then the other players pay him the amount of points bid, and if the high bidder loses, then the each of the other players are paid the amount of points bid.  Online implementations of the game generally play for a predetermined number of rounds and the individual player with the most points at the end of the last round is considered the winner.&#10;&#10;",

A deal is 16 cards each player.&#10;&#10;Allowable plays are singles, pairs, triplets, runs singles (5+ cards), consecutive pairs or triplets (2+ sets), full house (triplet+pair), and bombs (four of a kind plus an additional card, except for aces, where its a triplet plus an additional card).&#10;&#10;The game is played for points - you get as many points as there are cards remaining in your opponent's hand, unless he is holding 16, 15, or 14 cards, in which case you would just get 50, 40, or 30 points (respectively).  A typical threshold for winning the game is 60 points.&#10;&#10;",

Each property costs $5,000, and the rent for each property is $1,000 times the number of properties next to it owned by the same player (so as more properties are owned in a row the rent goes up). Once all of the properties have been purchased from the bank, players can buy property chains from one another. The other major change is the concept of &quot;marriage&quot;. When two players become land on the same square, they become married. Later, if you are married and land on your spouse's square, you sue for divorce and talk half of their property. If you are married and land on the single players square, the marriage gets annuled and the player gets sent to &quot;Morrow Rock&quot; (the game's equivalent to jail).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Topologic is a game of logic and deduction, but also uses piece movement.&#10;&#10;Every game is played over two rounds. In the first round one player plays the role of the referee (who hides a secret), the other the role of the seekers. In the second round the roles reverse.&#10;&#10;The 5 seekers are moved across the playing field (an assembled area of connected Nestortiles). Then the referee counts the score of the currently occupied locations (1 point for a color and/or number match) and announces the sum of the scored points. As they get more information, the seekers can deduce where the secret is hidden.&#10;&#10;Topologic is abstract, but players are encouraged to come up with a thematic background they like. This even includes renaming the game for each session.&#10;&#10;",

Your herd was once over twenty strong but disease and predators have brought you down to your last four rabbits. To make matters worse, humans and their machines have been approaching and your warren may be in grave danger.&#10;  To win the game, you must have 12 or more Rabbits in play at the end of the last turn. Each game consists of 37 turns representing the weeks between Spring and Winter. You will need to make efficient use of your rabbits' abilities to Collect Food, Produce New Rabbits, and Explore New Areas if your herd is to survive.&#10;  The challenge in Rabbit comes not from competition with other players but from the game itself. Rabbit can be enjoyed as a 1 player game or as a cooperative 2 player game. ( in a 2 player game, 1 player controls the Thinker and the other player controls Scouts and Fighters )&#10;&#10;",

The game play is simple: the player throws the 6 special dice and put his pieces in the path. Captures are possible too, and the winner is the player that moves all 3 pieces to his island.&#10;&#10;A Sri Lankan race game for two players. It has elements of Ludo-type games, in as much that you both start with three men and you win by getting all three 'home'. The board is unusual, in that it is not a 'circle', rather it is a track of 31 spaces, with some spaces marked as castles and you are safe from being sent home on them.&#10;&#10;",

The two-year final push to Terra was the bloodiest fighting seen in centuries. In the end, Terra had been freed with the Word of Blake scattered to the darkest corners of the universe. Stepping into that vacuum, Stone forged a new &quot;Terran Hegemony&quot; in The Republic of the Sphere. With the end of the Jihad, the survivors are rebuilding their shattered armies, introducing new machines to replace those whose factories ceased to exist in the fires of the Jihad.&#10;&#10;BattleTech Technical Readout: 3085 gives a detailed look at the machines introduced during the waning days of the Jihad and into the founding days of Devlin Stone&rsquo;s Republic of the Sphere. This book includes the latest &rsquo;Mechs, battle armor, aerospace and vehicles as well as new late-Jihad support vehicles. In addition, this sourcebook heralds the long-awaited update of Technical Readout: Project Phoenix, featuring brand-new art and additional variants. Conventional infantry make their Technical Readout debut with fifty-six individual infantry formations from classic foot infantry to xeno-planetary soldiers. And finally, after more than twenty years of silence, Land-Air BattleMechs explode back into a Technical Readout with a look at the original four LAMs and their Star League history.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Wired.Com review of The Goonies 25th Anniversary Edition DVD Set:&#10;&#10;&quot;.... the set&rsquo;s true treasure - a special Goonies-themed board game.&#10;&#10;The bulk of the box set&rsquo;s real estate is devoted to this game, and immediately upon cracking open the shrink wrap you are taken by its diminutive size. Still, if The Goonies taught us anything it&rsquo;s that size doesn&rsquo;t always matter, and I&rsquo;m happy to report that this is the case here. Though the board itself is only about half the size of your average game, it&rsquo;s actually a brilliantly colored fold-up printed on super sturdy laminated stock that appears perfectly capable of standing up to multiple years&rsquo; worth of play sessions. The same can be said for the game&rsquo;s Move Cards which, while not quite as brawny as most CCG cards, are thick enough to get the job done.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is fairly simple and properly reflects the spirit of the source materials - players take the role of one of five Goonies (Mikey, Data, Mouth, Chunk or Andy) and use a three-card hand in an attempt to escape One-Eyed Willy&rsquo;s cave. Players disarm traps to collect Gold Doubloons, and the first to reach the &quot;Escape&quot; square with three such Doubloons wins the game. The process is complicated by a trio of tricky Skull Spaces (only one of which contains the necessary key) that must be passed to reach the exit. This is balanced out by a fun selection of Special Move Cards that allow players to switch places with or steal gold from opponents. While certainly not the most engaging board game experience in movie fandom, it does manage to channel the proper amount of nostalgia and charm in a small but effective package.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sea Ranger is a new type of game, where learning is entertaining and family fun.  The world's oceans our are largest single resource.  If they are abused, mis-managed or ignored; we on land will be worse off for our neglect of this wonderful planet.&#10;&#10;Sea Ranger can teach or remind us all of our place in this world; how we use the oceans and waterways; the balance of life and our needs; raise our awareness of how mankind neglects or abuses these incredible places.&#10;&#10;Within, on and around our oceans and rivers, hide a multitude of life, living in a state of balance, growing and evolving.  Mankind is upsetting this balance to dangerous levels.&#10;&#10;Learn, have fun with friends and family, share this knowledge and make a difference in this world.&#10;&#10;What is Sea Ranger?&#10;&#10;Sea Ranger is a board game designed to educate and entertain 2-6 players about the amazing and diverse wildlife that inhabits the oceans and waterways creating a giant circle of life.  We can also learn how mankind uses and abuses this incredible resource we all share.&#10;&#10;Sea Ranger is a multi-facetted game.  Not only are the players learning about the aquatic environment, they are also learning about themselves.  Players learn many qualities of character that are required to either win or prevent collective loss among the players.  They share the responsibilities, successes and benefits.&#10;&#10;Players learn:;&#10;&#10;To share and care for resources.&#10;&#10;Collective and individual responsibility.&#10;&#10;Manage resources.&#10;&#10;To maintain a balance of life and needs.&#10;&#10;Value life in all forms as part of the wealth of this world.&#10;&#10;Respect each players participation and support.&#10;&#10;The best part is that it is fun doing this.&#10;&#10;Who Can Play?&#10;&#10;The game is aimed at children from 8 years and over and adults.  Children will require guidance to assemble.&#10;&#10;Children quickly master the rules.&#10;&#10;So how does it all work?&#10;&#10;The game gives players knowledge and choices.  Players can easily discern what feels right or is the right thing to do.  We all know within our hearts what is right and good, even if we don't know the answer.&#10;&#10;The game uses a special board and tokens.  You print out the board and pieces on your colour printer, then cut and assemble the components.  To make them last longer or be more durable you may mount them on card or laminate the pieces.  Teach the children skills as they read instructions and learn to cut out the pieces.&#10;&#10;The game is directed by a special card deck which will present players with a series of events and choices.  The players must decide how they will resolve these, sometimes this may require teamwork and sharing.  There are many different strategies you can use to win, some can be very quick, others slower.&#10;&#10;Part of the game revolves around maintaining the circle of life, ensuring a balance of species to enable life to continue.  Each creature is part of that circle and has a unique role to play.&#10;&#10;Players must then try and balance mankind's intervention and damage to the seas and waterways.  It is a careful juggling act; players individually cannot hope to keep the balance so you need to play cooperatively.&#10;&#10;What Do I Get?&#10;&#10;Sea Ranger is 26-page colour PDF plus a small rules booklet.   The game requires you to print 16-pages to create the board, cards &amp; tokens.  Included is the deluxe card set giving you the choice of finish.  Where possible we have tried to minimise the graphical content to save ink.  Ideally the major components are printed on card.  Some simple assembly is required.&#10;&#10;(Edutainment Games, www.edutainment-games.com)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tribal Dice is a unique new solitaire and interactive multiplayer game where players use eight dice with eight sides (8d8) in various colors.  The dice represent tribal spirits that must be restored in an ancient ritual to save the tribe and determine the new chieftain.  A spirit is fully restored when it shows the highest number, and when it shows that number, each one grants the player a different special power that can be invoked one time to influence the other dice in the game.  Players can also re-roll matching dice.&#10;&#10;Victory is predicated on strategic planning for which dice to re-roll, when and what order to invoke special powers, and some luck.  The solitaire game provides a score, whether won or lost, that a player can attempt to improve over successive games.  The multiplayer game has an adjustible game length and a high level of interaction.&#10;&#10;Although current electronic implementations of the game allow only solitaire and three player multiplayer, it is possible to play with any number of players, and a special &quot;chaos rule&quot; allows for large groups to play the game without any downtime, as they can invoke their special powers out of turn order.&#10;&#10;",
