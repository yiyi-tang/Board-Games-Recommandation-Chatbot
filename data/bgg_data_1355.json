It is, if not the first, at least one of the few board games that refer to a real historical event. It reproduced the conditions of the real battle on a board while the strategy was settled with dice and fifty-two plastic pieces.&#10;&#10;&mdash; from the Dictionary of Argentine Toys, by Daniela Pellegrino&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Have at You! is a quick-playing card game about hand-to-hand combat during the 16th to 18th Centuries, as inspired by films such as the Errol Flynn classics of the 1940s as well as the more recent Pirates of the Carribean series. Each player takes the role of fighters who can get their hands on any weapons available to defeat the enemy. Each fighter has a fixed number of physical damage points that, once expended, result in his or her death.&#10;&#10;In the base set, combat takes place aboard a ship, with the kind of weaponry available that one might expect: Daggers, Cutlasses, Belaying Pins, Pikes, Pistols, Grappling Hooks, and the occasional Bottle of Rum. Future expansions will explore other locations, such as Taverns and Encampments.&#10;&#10;Play follows a basic rock-paper-scissors mechanic of taking actions when available and trying to avoid their cancellation through the opponent's play of reaction cards. But be careful! Every action causes fatigue, with nastier weapons causing more of it. As fighters get tired, fatigue turns to physical damage, so a player must balance the health of their own fighter while trying to take down the enemy.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to play the game. At the most basic is a &quot;duel&quot; where a player wins once his or her opponent goes down. &quot;Brawls&quot; can also be played, where the death of an opponent &quot;spawns&quot; a new enemy, so victory is dependent upon the number of fighters eliminated on both sides. This base set also supports up to four players, so teams can fight against each other, while assisting teammates.&#10;&#10;The base set includes over 140 &quot;mini-cards&quot; that can be self-printed along with the other tracks necessary to play. There is also an option to have the mini-cards professionally published at a reasonable cost. All of the components were designed to fit within a &quot;video tape box.&quot;&#10;&#10;NOTE: The &quot;Card(s)&quot; option does not include the rules and charts needed for play. If you want the cards and the rest of the game, make sure to select the PDF+Card(s) option.&#10;&#10;Come test your mettle on the high seas with Have at You!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The time: late evening&#10;The date: 17 February 1864&#10;The Place: Breach Inlet, South Carolina&#10;&#10;Standing in the submarine&rsquo;s forward hatch, Lieutenant George E. Dixon pulled his cap down and tightened up his oilskin watch coat. The February sea cut through to his bones. This was the third night he ventured from behind Battery Marshall on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island, and his seven-man crew was grumpy from having had no luck spotting, let alone attacking even one of the Yankee warships blockading Charleston harbor.&#10;&#10;Dixon fingered the dented $20 gold piece in his trouser pocket. It was a gift from Queenie, his sweetheart, a keepsake that already earned its place aboard ship. A few months earlier at a wooded tangle of a place called Shiloh, the coin stopped a minie ball from shattering his leg. The dent reminded him how fickle fate and fortune are in this war, and it reminded him of home. He had that coin engraved &ldquo;Shiloh April 6th, 1862. My life Preserver&rdquo; and added his initials &ldquo;G.E.D.&rdquo;, so sure was he of the coin&rsquo;s power.&#10;Well, tonight that power was napping. Frustrated and cold, Dixon took one last look to the southeast through his telescope. The weather wasn&rsquo;t likely to improve and he hoped that this would be the night he and the crew of the &ldquo;CSS Hunley&rdquo; would strike a blow against the Yankee blockade.&#10;&#10;Here now&hellip; was that a light?&#10;There!&#10;And once again, low and to the south-southeast. A light!&#10;&#10;He rapped the coin against the hull to startle the men. &ldquo;Look sharp,&rdquo; he muttered. Then, in a voice low and tense, he said &ldquo;Look sharp and prepare to crank!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Game Overview&#10;&#10;Infernal Machine: Dawn of Submarine Warfare is a solitaire board game that casts the player in the role of inventor/entrepreneur in mid-19th century America. The game is set during a historical moment when the business environment has gotten rather dynamic &ndash; it is the tumultuous landscape of the American Civil War. The player&rsquo;s task is to design, build, and put to use a submarine during that war.&#10;&#10;Infernal Machine can be played either in scenario form or campaign. In a campaign, you can choose the city or port where the project&rsquo;s machine shop will be located. Since construction materials and labor costs money, your role as entrepreneur comes into play as you seek out Investors to join your team; their cash will provide the funds that help your Fishboat take shape. As Inventor, your design gives form and substance to the size and shape of your submarine, and to its capabilities. Will it carry a snorkel? Will its prow be an armored ram? Will it have dive planes? Will it push a spar torpedo? Will it be powered by the muscle strength of a crew cranking the propeller or will you install a boiler engine?&#10;&#10;To bring blueprints to life, you will need to hire Mechanics, whose engineering expertise keeps the machine&rsquo;s construction on schedule. Once assembly is complete, your Mechanics can join the crew, using their repair capability to keep the machinery and the vessel running smoothly. Journeymen can also lend a hand on the shop floor and inside the Fishboat, while Sailors bring nautical know-how as well as sheer brawn.&#10;&#10;While that machine shop is busy with the submarine&rsquo;s construction, the game reminds you that the war drags on and it is an unstable business environment. Prices for materials and labor fluctuate. Current events can affect your construction schedule and your machine shop&rsquo;s performance. Public, and even personal circumstances may force your hand. You may decide to push your Fishboat into the water before you feel it is optimal, or push your crew into battle with little training.&#10;&#10;In this game you assign crew, taking their characteristics into consideration, such as morale, strength, engineering expertise. Your first mission will most likely be a simple affair, propelling the infernal machine forward, submerging, turning about, and returning to the surface. It will garner valuable experience that improves your crew&rsquo;s Training Level. But even that simple affair could prove treacherous. Will the Fishboat drift? Will it sink and become irretrievable? Will your crew panic in the dark as they breathe in the exhalation of their comrades in that cramped machine? Will you be forced to evacuate the crew and salvage the Fishboat later? Will the crew survive the ordeal?&#10;&#10;Later missions will be directed at the enemy. In this game, you may play either side, Union or Confederate. There are a variety of missions and targets. Will your Fishboat be aimed at the Federal blockade? Will it pull a mine at the end of a rope, or push a torpedo at the end of a spar? Will the crew survive contact with the enemy? Will they survive their own weapon&rsquo;s detonation? Perhaps the nature of the mission will be quite different. Will you carry a spy into enemy territory? Will your Fishboat unload a raiding party?&#10;&#10;Secrecy is vital. Will you send your machine out under a moonless sky? That will help conceal crew and machine but it will make navigation difficult. Will you limit the number of machinists and investors, thereby reducing the chance of rumor or gossip leaking out? Too few and you compromise your machine&rsquo;s capabilities. Your Fishboat&rsquo;s chances are much better if that machine is kept a secret, but it is a cantankerous machine that will punish mistakes.&#10;&#10;A successful mission means your coffers will be filled with prize money. This is a capitalist&rsquo;s war, and the War Department is offering juicy bounties. In contrast, there are many ways to fail. Coming back without making contact with the enemy is one way, but it could be far worse. Will you add the names of your crew to the Rolls of the Missing?&#10;&#10;Scenarios and Campaign&#10;&#10;Historical scenarios use only part of the rules to present such events as the CSS Hunley&rsquo;s successful attack outside Charleston Harbor in 1864. It was the first time a submarine sank its target, a landmark event in military history. The heart of the game is the campaign, which allows you to design and build your Infernal Machine, select a crew, train that crew, and perform missions against the enemy. You manage funds and personnel, and navigate the fortunes of war as well as the waterways in enemy territory. A scenario will take approximately two hours to play while a campaign can last several gaming sessions as it spans the calendar from 1861 to the end of the war in 1865.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play&#10;&#10;Each monthly turn gives you an opportunity to recruit personnel (Investors, Mechanics, Journeymen, or Sailors), each represented by a deck of cards. Each recruit comes with one or more benefits as well as costs or drawbacks. An Investor, for example, may be a generous provider of funds, but he may insist on being the captain of the ship. Does he know what he&rsquo;s doing?! A Sailor may prove to be strong and cool under pressure, but he may be clumsy. Will that clumsiness jeopardize his crewmates?&#10;&#10;Each turn also provides you an opportunity to work on your Fishboat. You purchase Bulkheads and other major sections of the submarine, each represented by tiles. They cost funds and require engineering expertise to incorporate into a seaworthy vessel. You also purchase a variety of mechanisms as you make decisions about the capability of your Fishboat.&#10;&#10;Recruitment and Building is followed by the passage of time when the Month marker is moved forward on the calendar. Debts must be paid, if you have any, and you must check the Fortunes of War table to see if something unexpected happens that month. Will prices rise? Will one of your Journeymen get engaged and leave your shop? Will the enemy shell the wharf where your Fishboat is waiting to go into action? Will you get an offer to use your machine shop to make parts for the War Department, giving you a contract and additional funds? Will the enemy capture the town, forcing you to move to another location? Each month has its own table of random events, and there is one set used when playing Union and another when playing Confederate. This adds to the feel of the historical experience while also increasing replayability. The Confederate experience is quite different from playing the Union. The latter is an industrial business environment while the Confederacy&rsquo;s economy gradually spirals into oblivion.&#10;&#10;Each month you have the option to finish the turn by taking your seaworthy Fishboat into action. There are four Action Boards in the box, each providing its own unique historical and nautical conditions (Charleston, Mobile, New Orleans, and the James River from City Point to Richmond).&#10;&#10;You setup a mission by establishing meteorological conditions on the Action Board (drift direction, drift intensity, visibility, and weather), and assign each crewman a position inside your Fishboat. Will you call off the mission because the current is too strong? Will you wait for a better opportunity, or will you push ahead despite the risk?&#10;&#10;Your submarine will move from one space to the next as it executes its mission. During a mission you assign jobs to each crewman (crank, repair, rally, or operating a mechanism). This is new technology and the submarine is an untried machine, so malfunctions are likely and you will assign crew to manage and hopefully repair them. In many cases, just getting out there and locating a target is a victory of sorts, and getting the crew back home can feel like a triumph. Of course, your mandate is to do more than make contact with the enemy and survive. To gain prize money, you will have to prove your machine&rsquo;s efficacy against the enemy. It&rsquo;s an old story: higher the risk, greater the reward.&#10;&#10;If you manage to navigate your machine and crew to make contact with its target, action shifts to the Tactical Board. There, the Fishboat closes in and you hope conditions are right so that it remains concealed. Decisions you made leading up to this tense moment have put your crew in a good position, or maybe in a bad one. In either case, history is watching.&#10;&#10;Game Components&#10;4 Actions Boards (12&rdquo; x 18&rdquo;),&#10;1 Mechanics Board (8&rdquo; x 18&rdquo;),&#10;1 Tactical Board (8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;),&#10;3 Countersheets (including boat tiles),&#10;3 Card Decks (Recruits, Navigation, Discovery),&#10;2 d10 dice&#10;Booklets and Player Aids&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lasalle is a tactical Napoleonics game suitable for beginners or veterans in which any army can fight any other or you can play historical scenarios. Players are a division or corps commander leading battalions of infantry, batteries of artillery and regiments of cavalry. A game is an affair for about three hours&rsquo; play on a modest table with about a dozen units on each side with no paperwork other than marking disruption against a unit's track.&#10;&#10;The second edition has a new sequence of play, driven by momentum and interrupts, allows players to do virtually anything in any order, differently every turn. Completely new rules for the use of the general figure (i.e. &ldquo;you&rdquo;) permit you to choose the personality and effect of your intervention in the sequence. Skirmishing has been reinvented from the top-down. The two sides contribute skirmishers to their opposing &ldquo;screens&rdquo; and each turn they determine which side&rsquo;s screen has the advantage. That, in turn, affects the momentum and sequence, not to mention possibly preventing worn units from rallying, obscuring targets from shooters, or even sniping at infantry units as they try to change formations. Movement has been radically simplified. Rather than worrying about evolutions of individual units, movement gets you from point A to B with a certain number of &ldquo;complications&rdquo; that accrue as you try to do difficult things like changing formation near the enemy, moving through difficult terrain, interpenetrating, or attacking. Combat has been redesigned so that it is a more decisive either/or experience. Troops either press an attack home, or they are discouraged and fall back with few casualties to either side.&#10;&#10;Second Edition Lasalle is a much more holistic game where you are playing not just individual units but rather an entire military effort, and everything affects everything else. You control the sequence and pace of events while your opponent tries to wrest that control from you. What your soldiers can accomplish is not just the result of moving them and rolling dice, but part of the overall situation into which you&rsquo;ve led your army.&#10;&#10;",

How will the Combined Fleet challenge the Beiyang Fleet, which has the battleships Dingyuan and Zhenyuan, which were called the strongest ships in the Orient? And how will the Japanese Army capture the fortress of Lushun and Weihaiwei?&#10;&#10;The game system of this game is called card-driven, and makes full use of cards that represent war resources and historical events and tactics.

The original score also has the goat defeating the German army and the Kaiser&#10;&#10;A simple roll and move game where players use a small wooden marble to move along a path by the roll of he dice. The playing board is slightly elevated at one end to create a slope. The path mostly contains a series small holes for the marble to sit, but every so often on the path is a much larger hole where if a player lands directly on the large hole by the dice roll then the wooden marble falls through and rolls down the slope to the start and the player must begin again.&#10;&#10;A player may &quot;Butt&quot; an opponent forward if he directly lands on that player. First player to reach Paddy McGinty's Goat's right eye is deemed the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The player who plays the highest number card in the seventh trick wins the round and gets a Heart token. Whoever collects two Heart tokens first wins the game.&#10;&#10;Based on the orthodox trick-taking rules, in which you must follow suit, this game is characterized by the changes made to the ranks in the seventh trick. So how would you prepare for it over the six tricks up to that point?&#10;&#10;Feel the sensation of outwitting the opponent as well as that of being outwitted. You can experience various emotions in a short gameplay.&#10;&#10;&quot;&quot;5&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&quot;&quot;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#189;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#151;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#151;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#151;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#189;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#190;&#180;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#239;&#188;&#151;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#149;&#230;&#142;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#150;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#233;&#174;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#230;&#186;&#150;&#229;&#130;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#230;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#191;&#171;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#22

In order to reinvigorate London's transportation system, all stations are unlocked; pick up any passenger even on your first turn!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players start with extra passengers to activate more areas on their player board.&#10;     London is divided into districts, and you'll need access to build track to various parts of the city.&#10;     The new Unlock Districts extension modifies your player board so instead of unlocking passenger colors, players unlock districts.&#10;&#10;&#10;And then there's Paris, well known for its mass transit strikes and your new Maglev Metro enterprise there is no exception. There are strikes scheduled constantly throughout the city at various stations!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Union bosses strike at a different station every few turns, shutting down all business at affected stations: trains zip right on past the stations and passengers cannot be picked up or dropped off until they reopen.&#10;     They're so brazen they've published a strike schedule! At least this helps you plan ahead of time.&#10;     Defy the picket lines as a strike breaker, which costs you VPs in order to save you time.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game starts with players designing the Town by choosing from the 12 available districts, ranging from forest to the central business district. Changing the set up of the Town means that the game has more variability over time as districts advantage different candidates. Players are also assigned purple 'values' cards, which they share with the players next to them. This means you have things in common but, in a 4 player game, have nothing in common with the person sitting across from you! Values are important: your candidates perform better if they have the same values and your projects give you more legacy points if they also align with your values.&#10;&#10;Once the Town is established and the districts chosen, players select cards (their candidates and inventory) and begin building up their arsenal for the upcoming elections. Be sure to select good candidates! They come with one or more Persuasive (P), Strategic (S) or Ruthless (R) skills which determines the number and type of actions they can make as candidates and later on as councillors.&#10;&#10;Each district is up for election and players spend resources trying to ensure their candidate comes out as the winner. Players adopt the persona of their candidate and give a short 'campaign speech' to the table, outlining why they deserve your vote. The player with the &quot;best speech&quot; wins additional support which increases their odds of being elected. Support is also increased by the candidate's popularity in that district and any other cards you burn to give you a competitive edge. Be careful: the more you burn now, the less you can do once you're in Town Hall! Each candidate elected is worth legacy points, which decide the game.&#10;&#10;Winning candidates become councillors who can complete project in their term of office if they have the necessary skills (P, S or R). Complete a project and get more legacy points. Diversity is key: players are rewarded bonus points for a complete PSR set of 3. At the end of 3 rounds the player with the highest number of legacy points is the winner! For experienced players, there is the option to include an add-on mode where the Mayor of the day tries to persuade players to support their proposal.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Waking up one day, you are filled with the overflowing passion to be as the travelers of ancient biblical times, and decide to travel to the holy land of Spain, the city of Santiago de Compostela. You thus begin your travels from your hometown of Paris to Santiago and finally return home the way whence you came.&#10;&#10;The game is begun by shuffling the number cards (the companion cards) and laying them out between Paris and Santiago. When your turn comes, advance your pilgrim card as much as you like and earn a travel companion card. There is no restriction on the distance you can travel towards the card you desire, but there is no turning back once you advance your pilgrim.&#10;&#10;How do you turn your journey into the best pilgrimage? By collecting travel companions (number cards)! You must choose number cards very carefully. In order to score the most by the cards you collect, you must collect as many of the same cards as possible, or collect various kind of cards. For example, the number 1 card allows you to score with just one card, but you must collect a large amount of number 9 cards (and/or a variety of cards) in order to score with them!  In this game, you win by scoring more points than other pilgrims in a total of two rounds: a journey from Paris to Santiago and another one from Santiago to Paris.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Maybe the real treasure was the friends we made along the way&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;",
