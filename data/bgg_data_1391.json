    "Description": "The heretic pharaoh Akhenaten has abandoned you and the other old gods. He worships only his new Sun God, Aten. The people follow their leader blindly, leaving you weak and crumbling.&#10;&#10;By influencing the six Domains of Egypt, you and your rivals will slowly take back some of your powers. Through common spells and mighty enchantments, you will eventually have power enough to bring forth an eclipse powerful enough to stop the Sun God and his favored pharaoh. All while struggling to be the most powerful god by the end.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Deities of the Old Kingdom is a puzzle game about manipulating a dice grid to gain the resources you need.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you'll roll three dice and push some of them into the 5x5 dice grid. Connect as many symbols as possible to gain the resources you need. Spend your resources to unlock enchantments and - by the very end - your own unique Eclipse spell.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A clever captain can indirectly kill a greedy opponent, saddle them with a dodgy crew or build a Longship that can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.&#10;&#10;After the fourth round is over, players tally their banked loot and subtract any fallen Captains from their final score to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "RosenKreuz is an new abstract strategy game for two players. It uses a checkerboard of 8 x 8 squares, like chess and checkers, but with very different mechanics from both.&#10;&#10;The players' pieces are distinguished by symbols, and both have equal numbers of black and white pieces. The object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces of either color.&#10;&#10;The game is characterized by three different capture methods. By major capture, you can capture your opponent's pieces by forming a group of the same color with your opponent's pieces and your own pieces. By minor capture, you can capture an enemy piece on a square of a different color than it by replacing. By attainment capture, you can capture any opponent piece by reaching the far end of the board.&#10;&#10;Your piece can be moved by jumping over friendly pieces, so the game develops quickly. You need to read the board and make good use of the three capture methods to advance the game to your advantage.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, a dark power still exists in the realm, and lies within an ancient temple of great evil known as the Temple of Despair. If it is not destroyed, Bram will return, and he will be so powerful that none will be able to stop him.&#10;&#10;There are four ancient temples in the Wildlands, but you don't know which temple you must destroy. You must&#10;visit the many ancient ruins strewn across the Wildlands, searching for clues to the location of the Temple of Despair. Fortunately, some of these ruins contain powerful&#10;Relics that will help you in your quest. But beware, the dark, oppressive power of the Temple of Despair is far-reaching and will pursue you relentlessly, so that you can never retrace your steps!&#10;&#10;Temple of Despair is the second Fantasy Adventure Module in the Roll-With-It system, a modular, solitaire roll-and-write adventure game system with endless possibilities for adventure through an accomplish-the-task-and-escape-the-maze-style gameplay.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is centered around a maze or map, through which the player must navigate, accomplish some objective(s), and escape the map under pressure from the enemy's attacks via the Doom die. The simple, puzzley, maze-style gameplay is approached differently in each adventure, building on the basic rules with new rules, concepts, and components that make each adventure feel fresh and unique.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unlike in our timeline, the fighting continues as German resistance fighters engage in a prolonged guerrilla war. With the Manhattan Project still incomplete, Japan fighting on and the Allied invasion of Europe losing millions of men, the Allies are war-weary and there is pressure to bring the troops home. While the Wehrmacht was defeated, the Nazi leadership has spent 1943 onwards building up a huge secret guerrilla force &ndash; Werwolf - to turn the occupation of Germany into a costly quagmire. Other groups, calling themselves the Edelweiss Movement, are opposed to the Nazis but also to the invaders and will fight to restore an independent and patriotic Germany. The Fuhrer himself has gone missing, and many Nazi officials are in hiding, perhaps awaiting their chance to return to power.&#10;Four factions are now competing for control and the loyalty of the German population: the Allied Occupation Forces (Western Allied Troops and German police, referred to as Allies in the rules) the Soviet Union (the Red Army and NKVD, referred to as Soviets in the rules), the Edelweiss Movement (patriotic but anti-Nazi German resistance, referred to as Edelweiss in the rules) and the Werwolf organisation (former SS and other Nazi fanatics trained in guerrilla warfare, referred to as Werwolf in the rules). The struggle will be not only for military control and the hearts and minds of the German people but also over the remnants of the Nazi war machine and research programs. The Soviets and Allies may reluctantly co-operate to crush German guerrillas but will compete to secure top German scientists and prototypes for their own arms race. As the Allies try to de-Nazify the populace and entice them with American pop culture, the Soviets will use everything from indoctrination to mass deportation to keep Germany under control. Loyalties will be split between democracy, communism and resurgent fascism or nationalism. This will not be an easy occupation&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Instead of playing with clans of mercenaries against marauding monsters, you now swap roles, taking on the role of hordes of fearsome monsters who fight off attacking humans. YOU are the monster player! Instead of looking for the favor of the Queen, you now work towards becoming the most infamous horde, competing to win the approval of the Great Entity of the Beast realm and be named Megalomonster.&#10;&#10;Your hordes are made up of different types of monsters, the most powerful of which are your champions. Each champion (represented in the game as card) has an ability and brings along further monsters (represented as dice or tokens) to be used in battles and other assignments. Send your champions to perform different tasks in your territory, have them lead battle against the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; humans, or fight it out with your fellow monster hordes for rewards in the champions&rsquo; arena. You can acquire mutations, armor, reinforcements, health berries, chillies, and more, all with a dice placement mechanic that not only requires planning of the right timing, but also of the right dice/tokens to be used in each job. Lots of new and different places await you, making Monster Lands 2 a very rewarding experience for Monster Lands 1 players, while at the same time working perfectly stand-alone (you don&rsquo;t need Monster Lands 1 to play Monster Lands 2).&#10;&#10;Wait, did we tell you that your monsters include mulfins? The mulfins, those little buggers, tend to explode, so be warned when handling them. But then again, your monsters still feed on their remains if they do explode ... after all, a monster has to eat.&#10;&#10;Who is going to be the most infamous monster horde?&#10;&#10;",

The Enforcers Expansion Pack is composed of three characters, ALINA IVANKOVA, TOM LEE and &ldquo;RAVEN&rdquo; KWIATKOWSKI, with their three miniatures and their corresponding cards.&#10;&#10;The Enforcers in multiplayer game&#10;&#10;The Enforcers are three special characters that players can recruit throughout the game, like we usually do with the Jobs cards. The peculiarity is that they are part of a common market and that there are only three, so, as you can imagine, they are characters with outstanding skills, who have a notable impact in each game. The Enforcers, as we said, will also have their own miniature and move around the board like the thugs. Their power on the board, that is, their strength on the streets of Chicago, lies in the fact that they all have a passive skill that can be activated at specific moments in the game. In addition, and as with vehicles, they cannot be eliminated from the game: they have come to the city to stay.&#10;&#10;Each of the Enforcers comes with two additional cards: their Enforcer card, like that of the rest of the Right Hands, where their muscle and influence points are printed, as well as their skill and the effect it has on the crime rate; and a second card, where on one side we find how the mini works on the board in multiplayer games, and on the other,the specific rules of that Enforcer in solo games.&#10;&#10;The Enforcers in solo mode&#10;&#10;The second important new feature of this Expansion Pack has to do with the solo mode of Scarface 1920. The solo mode is based on a two-player game in which the other player is controlled by an AI (artificial intelligence) that builds a deck of cards with their own deck building system. This artificial intelligence will carry out its activity in Chicago like a player, but it will demonstrate a resource and organizational capacity superior to ours, forcing us to optimize our gang to the maximum to be able to overcome it. With this Expansion Pack, the rival gang in solo mode will have the invaluable help of an Enforcer, whose miniature will be used to determine where the power of the rival gang is in the map. In this mode, as we have said before, the Enforcers have a card where their skills are explained, which have a different impact on the game: in solo mode, Alina Ivankova, for example, is capable of extorting the rival in the reorganization phase depending on the number of jobs he has.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A turn-based Strategy game set in space. Conquer planets and overwhelm your opponents by controlling resources. Manage your resource points to build an army capable of controlling the galaxy.&#10;&#10;From the start of your turn you'll gather your resource points for the round. You can spend them on placing new troops, buying new ships, or upgrading your research and development. Then use these troops to fight or take over new territories.&#10;&#10;You can move as many troops into an area with opponents on it. After the movement phase begins the attack. Each player will roll dice for attacks. The dice roll required depends on the type of unit attacking. Most units require a 5 or a 6 on the dice for a successful hit. Each player will learn from these experiences to deploy a more effective strategy as the game moves on.&#10;&#10;Over time the territories you take away from your enemies will lessen the amount of Resource Points they get per turn, diminishing their ability to fight back. You can win by getting the opponent to surrender (ends a game faster) or you can play it out, and chase them through the map to destroy the troops they have left and end the game. Moving a fleet ship costs 10 RP, so the opponent will eventually run out. You win when the other player is unable to make any moves.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Backscore is a perfect-information game played on a 7x11 grid, in which each player controls a five-piece team and coach in a heavily abstracted sport scenario.  Points are scored by moving a neutral 'ball' piece back into a section of one's own back row, having pieces kick it about.&#10;&#10;Play is progressive - that is, the first player moves one piece, the second moves two, and thereafter each turn involves moving three pieces.  Moves are 'slides', much like a queen in chess, but each piece must move as far as possible - meaning that the challenges of the game are less about speed (action is quick and can range rapidly around the board), and more about strategizing to keep good control over one's pieces and setting up good positionings.&#10;&#10;Backscore is a more-complex descendant (different enough that it escapes being a plain variant, but close enough credit is important to give) of Neutron by Robert Krauss.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
