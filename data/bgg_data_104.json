    "Description": "Napoleon's Quagmire - The Campaign in Extremadura, March-November, 1809 (battles of Medellin, Talavera, Almonacid, and Oca&ntilde;a) is the VII volume of the games from OSG's THE LIBRARY OF NAPOLEONIC BATTLES series.&#10;&#10;The Year 1809 began with Napoleon&rsquo;s departure from the Iberian Peninsula, to face the Austrian threat on the Danube. He left his brother, Joseph, in nominal command of his armies in Spain, as puppet king in Madrid. Fighting flared on several fronts simultaneously, and the French occupation had some successes, notably at the siege of Saragossa, concluded by Marshal Lannes just before his departure to join the Emperor.&#10;&#10;In 1809 the French under Joseph nearly mastered the plains of Old and New Castile. However, the Napoleonic magic could not work at such distances (a dispatch sent from Vienna to Madrid, would travel 2,400 km in 12 to 14 days); when dispatches arrived they were often days or weeks out of date. A series of battles were fought during the course of the year along the approaches to Madrid from Portugal, where the future Duke of Wellington had just arrived with a small British Army to second the Spanish Army of Extremadura.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;     Two full-size color maps (22&quot;x34&quot; each)and two half-size maps (17&quot;x22&quot;)&#10;     Rulebook (28 pages)&#10;     Scenario Folder (24 pages)&#10;     Two counter sheets (560 units)&#10;     Two decks of cards (50 cards each, 100 total)&#10;     15 player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Series scale&#10;Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: &#10;&#10;     480 meters per hex, &#10;     1 hour per turn, &#10;     400-800 men per strength point. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;A Fantasy themed miniatures wargame without the miniatures.  Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.&#10;&#10;Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.&#10;&#10;Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.&#10;&#10;The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.  The  victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Pocket at Falaise is a game on the final phase of the Allied campaign in Normandy. After the failure of Hitler&rsquo;s counterattack in early August to halt the Allied breakout from Normandy, the German 7th and 5th Panzer Armies found themselves on the verge of being pocketed by converging American and British pincers. On the evening of August 16th the Germans began to pull back behind the Orne and Dives rivers, hoping to regroup for a defense of the Seine, even as the Allies attempted to close the trap on some twentyfive German divisions. Ultimately, about half the German forces in the pocket escaped, leaving almost all their heavy equipment behind. It was a major Allied victory, but not a war-winning one.&#10;&#10;At the end of the Gulf War in '91, cable TV news was full of horrific photos from the &quot;Highway of Death,&quot; the route back to Iraq from Kuwait that seemed, almost literally, to be &quot;paved&quot; with burnt-out vehicles. Those who study WWII remember similar destruction... on the road out of the Falaise Pocket... where 25 German divisions raced for survival, while the Allied armies aimed to turn Hitler's delayed counterattack on Normandy from failure to war-ending disaster. In one sense, neither side succeeded. But the devastation was something unprecedented.&#10;&#10;Now, you have a chance to do better. The Pocket at Falaise puts each player in the difficult position of trying to overcome the obstacles, both human and mechanical, tactical and operational, that interfered with success in 1944. Award-winning designer Ted Racier explains:&#10;&#10;The story of the Falaise battle is that of two German armies trying to escape a trap set for them by their own high command, and of the Allied armies trying to close the trap, despite the hesitations and divisions of their own higher commanders.&#10;&#10;While we may think of the Allies as having overwhelming forces, at the actual point of contact, there were relatively weak units trying to &quot;plug the leak&quot; against overwhelming numbers of intensely motivated Germans. The situation means that the &quot;retreating&quot; Germans are actually forced to do a lot of attacking, while the &quot;advancing&quot; allies found themselves in a desperate defense. The Pocket at Falaise uses a chit-pull activation system to capture some of the chaotic and uncoordinated efforts. Players are forced to juggle to make the best out of an increasingly difficult situation, and a combat scale that straddles &quot;tactical&quot; and &quot;operational,&quot; aiming to capture the best of both without adding a lot of fiddly rules. A complete set of solitaire rules for the game completes the package.&#10;&#10;Eisenhower called it, &quot;The Great Killing Ground.&quot; What the Germans called it cannot be printed. What you will call it depends on how well you do...

Each time a player's shield is broken, the player puts the shield into his hand. You win the game if on of your creatures attacks your opponent when he has no shields left (as long as your creature isn't blocked).&#10;&#10;Duel Masters is played in a very similar fashion to Magic: The Gathering, which is also made by Wizards of the Coast. Much of the terminology used in Duel Masters is the same as in Magic as well, such as &quot;tapped&quot;, &quot;summoning sickness&quot;, etc.&#10;&#10;Re-released as: Kaijudo&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A long time ago in a land far, far away, there was a thriving valley with various inhabitants. They wandered aimlessly in need of a true leader to guide them. Are you the king who will lead them the way? Do you have a strategy to acquire their trust, and are you cunning enough to challenge other would-be kings? They cannot be trusted as they will do anything to claim the crown you deserve. No sacrifice is too big or small for them. They may think being king is as easy as summoning subjects to their side, squeezing the gold from their pockets through taxes, and arranging some marriages, but only a true king will be able to keep up the morale and lead the inhabitants through the ever-changing circumstances in the valley and the hills.&#10;&#10;In King of the Valley, you must obtain the highest reputation of all the kingly contenders, with reputation being determined by influence, bonuses, and gold. To set up, lay out 25 of the character tiles from age I in a 5x5 grid, with each king starting on a different tile and with 2 gold in their reserve.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can first choose to acquire a tile from the &quot;hill&quot; for the listed gold price; the hill has two columns of six characters, with the characters costing 2-10 gold based on their height on the hill. When you acquire a tile, add it to your personal castle board. Characters have 0-5 influence, with the 1-5 influence characters being sorted by type and with the 0-value jester standing in for a character of your choice (but still being worth 0 influence). You then move your king orthogonally or diagonally, stopping on the character tile you want to claim; alternatively, you can move across 2-3 identical characters in a line, stopping on the space after them in order to collect them all! Add these character tile(s) to your castle board, and if you now have face-up characters with influence from 1-5, you can turn them face down to claim a kingdom bonus of points and coins.&#10;&#10;To end your turn, refill empty spaces in the grid by choosing one column of the hill, then drawing characters from it as needed to fill empty spaces. Finally, draw character tiles from the stack to refill the hill, thereby giving everyone a glimpse at what can come on the playing area in the future, not to mention what can be acquired if you have enough coins in hand.&#10;&#10;Specialist characters show up on the board &mdash; the priest, the wizard, and the tax collector &mdash; with you receiving immediate bonus actions should you collect them.&#10;&#10;When the hill can't be fill completely, the game ends. All characters in your collection add their influence points to your score. Collecting 3-5 knights in the same order grants you bonus points, as does each pairing of a farmer with a farmer's wife. Add any kingdom bonuses to your sum, then whoever has the highest reputation wins.&#10;&#10;",

The battle occurred around Chickamauga Creek, a tributary of the Tennessee River, in Norhern Georgia.&quot; (from the Chickamauga rules folder.)&#10;&#10;Chickamauga is one of four games included in the Blue &amp; Gray Quadrigame set.  The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder. A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.&#10;&#10;Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn. Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control. Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.&#10;&#10;A new concept, &quot;Attack Effectiveness&quot; is introduced in this set of games. Essentially, attacking units that receive an &quot;Attacker Retreat&quot; result in combat are rendered &quot;ineffective&quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day. This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs. This makes &quot;what the heck&quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &quot;ineffective&quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Guadalajara, portrays the operations launched by the Italian CTV (Corpo Truppe Volontarie&mdash;Corps of Volunteer Troops) towards Guadalajara with the ultimate objective of taking Madrid and putting a rapid end to the Spanish Civil War. The unexpected and dogged resistance of the Republican Army, which was fully involved in a deep reorganization, caused the failure of this offensive, forcing the Nationalists to give up trying to storm the capital and making them take the long road by capturing the whole country before being able to declare themselves victorious.&#10;&#10;After the failure of Franco's Nationalist troops to surround and conquer Madrid during the first months of the Spanish Civil War, Spain looked doomed to a long war of attrition.  During this gloomy period, a new force made its appearance -- the motorized Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV).  Lavishly equipped and overconfident after its first successful performance in the fall of Malaga, the Italians thought they could quickly and easily end the war.  Spain was not Abyssinia, however, and Madrid was not Malaga.  The new People's Republican Army was no longer the rag-tag mix of militia units that had fought the Nationalists only a few months before.  The Italians were repulsed after a fierce campaign fought under very tough conditions.  Madrid was once again saved for the Republicans, and two more years of war would ensue.&#10;&#10;Special rules regarding tanks, anti-tank defenses, flamethrowers, truck transports, traffic jams, morale, and panic will allow you to recreate the Italian offensive.  Will you succeed where your historical counterparts failed?  Will you break the Republican lines?  Will your volunteers panic as they did in 1937?

    "Description": "(from Compass Games website):&#10;&#10;Red Storm Over the Reich is a Ted Raicer game covering the epic final campaigns of WWII on the Eastern Front, as the forces of the Soviet Union smashed the German armies defending Poland, East Prussia, and Pomerania, and advanced across the Oder to Berlin. Included in the game are three scenarios.&#10;&#10;The first scenario is historical, which finds the German forces out of position. Their armies will likely be shattered on the first turn, but the victory conditions are tough on the Soviets&ndash; they must do at least as well as historically.&#10;&#10;Scenario two has the historic forces, but allows the Germans to implement Operation Sleigh-ride, a sane pull-back of the main defense line along the Vistula out of range of the opening Russian barrage (an operation historically nixed by Hitler) that at least allows for a more orderly flight.&#10;&#10;Scenario three combines Sleigh-ride with reinforcements from other fronts. It assumes that Hitler has had an incapacitating stroke in late November or early December, and the new Nazi leadership is sufficiently uncertain of its position that it defers in military matters to Guderian. The Ardennes Offensive is cancelled, as are the attempts to relieve Budapest, as well as substantial forces are evacuated from the Courland pocket. This increases German strength on the main eastern front by approximately 50% and doubles German tank strength, which, when combined with Sleigh-ride gives the Germans some serious fighting strength.&#10; Scenarios one and two can be completed in 8-12 hours and scenario three in 12-16 hours, depending on your individual playing style.&#10;&#10;Red Storm is the opposite of 1941 East Front Games: The Soviets have assembled a massive force and will rip gaping holes in the German lines through blitzkrieg-style attacks. The German player must somehow piece together a desperate defense only to have it repeatedly blown apart by the enemy. But time is the enemy of both players in this game. The Soviets need to accomplish their victory by the end of the last turn, satisfying the historical timeline, or they lose the game, and the Germans must delay the Soviet assault on Berlin long enough to prevent the Soviet win.&#10;&#10;The rules for Red Storm Over the Reich are moderate in complexity but feature enough chrome for both sides to recreate this desperate campaign. Special rules include: the creation of Kampfgruppe divisions (or not), naval evacuations, panzerfausts, Volksturm divisions, Leaders, Soviet Logistical Constraint, Hitler mandated attacks and more!&#10;&#10;Included with each game are two maps each 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo;, two sheets of counters (456 total), rules, set-up charts, tables, dice and game box.&#10;&#10;",

In Doodle Dungeon, each player works on their own dungeon blueprint. Drafted cards determine which elements &mdash; monsters, traps, and treasures &mdash; they have to add immediately. After fourteen cards have been drafted, the blueprint is passed to the next player, who then draws the route an anthropomorphic test hero will take because these days, even in the dungeon business, nothing works without quality inspection. The players receive their own blueprints back and try to keep the dummy hero from killing their monsters, stealing their treasures, and &mdash; obviously &mdash; making it out alive. They can use the drafted cards to fight off the hero or to support the heroes in their opponent's dungeons. In the end, only the creator of the most devious dungeon will triumph.&#10;&#10;Doodle Dungeon combines the rewarding elements of creating, then defending one's own dungeon, and mixes it with engaging draft-and-draw gameplay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Four complete scenarios are included -- ranging from the brief Aspern-Essling and Wagram battle scenarios to the lengthy Historical and Alternate campaigns.&#10;&#10;(BGG user's description)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Factory 42 is a Euro-style board game for 2-5 players. The game tells the story of the workweek of Marxistic dwarves in a steampunk industrial setting, placing the player in the role of factory Overseers. It combines worker placement and a cube tower to create a resource management puzzle. Factory 42 is a cutthroat competitive game with elements of co-operation and deals involving Economics, Fantasy, Industry and Negotiation with a pinch of satire, but not too much to make it a Humor game. It satisfyingly blends two-fold tensions: camaraderie forged in shared goals, and the opportunistic trampling of temporary competition. A tight game of glancing blows and communal glory creating a wicked blend of sharp elbows and shared ambition. Visually, Factory 42 takes its influence from 1920&rsquo;s Soviet Union propaganda, fantasy literature and elements of pre-WWI Prussian decor.&#10;&#10;The general process control at Factory 42 is as follows: &#10;&#10;         Receive work orders/requisitions from the government&#10;         Receive some of the requisitioned resources (as determined by the cube tower)&#10;         Load resources (and spike additional resources) onto railcars&#10;         Transfer the railcars to docks at individual manufacturing facilities&#10;         Burn leftover resources to generate steam&#10;         Trade resources on the open market&#10;         Use steam and resources to manufacture requested items.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Capricious Bureaucracy:* Resources made available to all players, making up a common pool, are delivered via the Bureaucracy Tower; a mechanic that can deliver or withhold resources in a random manner. This replicates the notion that &ldquo;the powers that be&rdquo; redirect funds/resources by tying them up in red tape, trapping resources that would otherwise normally be available for the general populace. What goes into the tower does not always come out, or may have been held up during some unknown bureaucratic process, to later materialize when least expected&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Requisition:* Tactical decisions start with the acquisition of resources vital to the production process. The order of worker meeples on the requisition line dictates the volume of resources acquired for the common pool (available to all) and the number that can be obtained and stored in a player&rsquo;s personal warehouse. Choices made here can benefit a player&rsquo;s future actions but may also unwittingly aid a rival, making each choice so very important.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Loading:* Players can tactically direct their workers to the loading bays where resources are loaded onto lines of rail transport. Order here can be extremely vital to one&rsquo;s success. Misjudging the order (or cunningly foreseeing the future) may lead a player to have to load a cart for a rival rather than for one&rsquo;s self. Alliances may be made during this process, just as enemies can be made of rivals, depending on choices made when loading&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Shipping and Storage:* Once loaded, each rail cart proceeds to the shipping location awaiting direction. Workers have the option of forwarding on the loaded carts to player&rsquo;s docks. Once more order of placement is paramount as carts are only shipped in order. A cart may not contain useful resources and so could be sent to a rival, taking up valuable storage space, or maybe it will benefit a rival in an attempt to build a verbally agreed alliance. Often a cart has been loaded with a wide variety of resources and only part of this precious load is of use. Limited storage space in player&rsquo;s personal docks and warehouses dictates the shipping decision-making process as much as a rival&rsquo;s needs&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Trade and Research:* Commodities may be traded on an ever changing market, often enabling an unnecessary resource to be exchanged at a price, for something of more use. Research is equally important, allowing players to expand storage facilities, improve  material handling in the manufacturing process or even learn how to use Invention cards to add special actions/abilities during play&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Manufacture and Accounting:* The government dictate what should...no, what must be manufactured during a game round. The government orders must be completed or many, sometimes all players suffer sanctions. A degree of cooperation is needed here for the greater good of Dwarven society, but on an individual level, completion of a government order leads to reward and ultimately progression on the path to victory&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Gather the best thieves and rob various locations in the city so as to go home with the most money at the end of the day.&#10;&#10;In Crooks you assume the role of a mafia boss and want to use your thieves tactically to increase your earnings or to thwart others.

By the end of the bloody struggle, both houses would be extinct and the crown grasped by the first of the Tudors.&#10;&#10;Sun of York is a card game depicting the tactical battles fought between the two royal houses.  Represented by the cards are all the day's major leaders, including King Henry VI (too weak a leader to maintain control of the kingdom), Margaret of Anjou (Henry's strong-willed and manipulative queen), King Edward IV (organizational genius and longest holder of the Crown), King Richard III (charismatic leader of questionable morals) and Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick (the &quot;King Maker&quot;).  Troop cards include Levies, Longbowmen, Knights, Cavalry, and mercenaries from the Continent, among others.  Terrain features and Special event cards are also included.&#10;&#10;Every major engagement (and a few minor ones) is included in Sun of York, for a total of eighteen scenarios in all!  Rules for randomly generated scenarios are included as is a campaign system allowing players to fight out the Wars to their bloody conclusion.&#10;&#10;Components include 200 cards, two player aid sheets, and one sheet of 234 status markers.  &#10;[This is a desktop published game.  Players are required to assemble all game components.]&#10;&#10;Now also available (August 2011) through GMT Games as a boxed set!&#10;&#10;",

Al&rsquo;s a bit eccentric; he doesn&rsquo;t trust the cops or banks, so all his loot is in his mansion, guarded by a diabolical security system of explosive traps. The good news is that he&rsquo;s out of town.&#10;&#10;It would be a shame if something happened to all that loot, but a Family (working together) that bested Al would make quite a name for itself. Of course, the most fame - and (dare we say) leadership of the Family - goes to the person who walks away from the job with the most loot.&#10;&#10;Your colleagues may not agree with you - but you all owe each other favors. Calling in the right favor at the right time is what leadership is all about in this business. The key is to work together to help yourself - and don't get blown up!&#10;&#10;In The Mansky Caper, players team up to ransack rooms of Al Mansky's mansion, opening safes to find the valuables inside.  Split loot with others in the room, and watch out for twists of fortune and dangerous traps that can ruin your plans with a bang!  The winner is the player who has accumulated the most loot in their private stash at the getaway car by the time Al&rsquo;s mansion is completely ransacked.&#10;&#10;",

The men who occupied the throne for the next 400 years were a particularly unpleasant bunch, whose main thought was of personal aggrandisement. Having deprived the English of the right of self-government, the more energetic of them set about trying to do a similar job on their neighbours. In Kings &amp; Castles the players take the part of these men as they pursue their ambitions at home and abroad. The treatment is broad-brush and fairly abstract: there is a map and the counters carry pictures of castles and soldiers, but you don't have to start worrying about dice and combat results; this is not a wargame.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to conquer as many regions as possible with their own and opponents forces - an intriguing mechanic - then decide whether to tax the hard working peasants or not. Plenty of decision making and room for tactics with a different player/king sequence every time you play.&#10;&#10;",

From June into July, Old Jube swept out of the Shenandoah Valley and across the Potomac River to advance on Washington DC. By threatening the Federal capital, Early and the Confederate command hoped to divert forces from Grant&rsquo;s Overland Campaign, relieving the pressure on Richmond.&#10;&#10;Historically, Early narrowly defeated Lew Wallace on the Monocacy River, outside of Frederick, MD. However, this &lsquo;victory&rsquo; cost him precious time and manpower. Though he went on to test the outer forts protecting Washington itself (mainly at Fort Stevens), Early was too weak and too late to take advantage of the once-denuded nature of the fortress garrisons.&#10;&#10;As Abraham Lincoln quipped, &ldquo;Mr. Early, you are late.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In To Take Washington, players first fight the Battle of Monocacy. Their relative success or failure there, as well as their raw efficiency, determines when the Confederates show up on the separate Fort Stevens map. An arrival mere hours earlier than their historical appearance makes an enormous difference in the strength of Union forces manning the defenses, since they had been stripped bare prior to Early&rsquo;s advance. Conversely, a mediocre showing at Monocacy will present the Confederate player with a very difficult problem at Fort Stevens. Jubal Early couldn&rsquo;t solve it &ndash; can you?&#10;&#10;To Take Washington covers these two related actions on two separate map areas. One (with two map sheets) covers the Monocacy battlefield while the other (with one map sheet) shows the area around Fort Stevens and a portion of Washington itself.&#10;&#10;The Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series premiered with None But Heroes, covering the Battle of Antietam, and went on to set a new standard of excellence with its presentation of Gettysburg in Last Chance for Victory: The Battle of Gettysburg. The LoB series rules are the pinnacle of over 30 years of development starting with the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series and its follow-on Series: Civil War Regimental Sub-Series (MMP). The LoB system and battle-specific rules incorporate fresh research while discarding the mistaken assumptions and false impressions that have crept into ACW games of the past forty years. Above all, Line of Battle is designed to capture the free-for-all nature of an American Civil War battle in a fun, fast, and very playable format.&#10;&#10;Scenarios: To Take Washington includes twelve scenarios, with one entry point for the full two-battle Campaign Game. Ten of the scenarios use only one map (either a portion of the Monocacy map set, or the single Fort Stevens map).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 15-30 minutes&#10;Hex: 110 yards / 100 meters&#10;Units: Batteries to Regiments&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheet (840 1/2&quot; counters - 267 playing pieces, rest markers)&#10;One 36-page Line of Battle Series v2.0 rulebook&#10;One 20-page To Take Washington rulebook&#10;Two 6-page dual-side printed LoB Charts &amp; Tables v2.0 booklet&#10;One single-side printed Terrain Key&#10;One Single-side printed Turn Record Track chart&#10;Two 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Museum Rush is a competitive thieving game in which players race against time to steal treasures from a museum while avoiding cameras, guards, and greedy rivals. Luckily these dastardly robbers have an array of items to help them get the better of the guards and their fellow thieves, such as sultry Llamas, mighty Underwear and the high-tech Cardboard Box.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a thief, moving up to three tiles a turn. Then if they are on a tile with loot they can take a stealing action to grab some loot from the tile. Certain tiles have special &quot;Rare Treasures&quot; that are worth a lot more than standard loot, but you have to crack the lock code by rolling the correct numbers before you can steal these!&#10;&#10;Each stealing action brings the nearest guard two spaces towards the thief's tile. Trying to crack a lock does the same. After stealing, the next card in the room is turned up, which might reveal more treasure. But turn up a security camera and the guard moves another 2 spaces closer! If the guard ends up on the same tile as your thief, you can slip away with a dice roll or play cards like &quot;Take Down&quot; or &quot;Lure&quot; to get rid of the guard. Otherwise the thief is thrown out of the Museum and loses all card but one. The player can break in again so there is no player elimination in the game.&#10;&#10;Each thief draws new cards at the beginning of their turns, these cards can be used to take out guards, disable security cameras and mess with the other thieves.&#10;&#10;When you draw a Clock card, time will advance and once you draw a certain number of clocks, depending on the number of players, the game ends.  At this point there is a rush to the nearest exit, rolling a dice to avoid dropping a card for every space you have to cover. The winner is determined by who has the highest value of loot at the game's end, once you are outside the Museum.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If more than one empty fist matches the Master Builder's choice, no-one builds.&#10;&#10;Play continues with the next player being the Master Builder and so on until somebody clears their hand. If you still hold pieces, Towers lose you 15pts, Gates 10pts and the Walls from 1-6 pts.

It is played on a hexhex board and a sufficient supply of stacked checkers.&#10;&#10;A stack can &quot;see&quot; a hex, when they are connected by a straight line, with no stacks in between. The players take turns placing stacks of their tokens on hexes that are seen by at least one friendly stack. The height of every newly-placed stack equals the number of your stacks that see the new stack. Replacing an existing stack with a new stack is possible, as long as the new stack is taller than the previous one. This works with opponent stacks (to capture), or your own stacks (to reinforce).&#10;&#10;Before the game, the host sets up the board and the guest decides which side he wants to play. Setup consists of one stack of two neutral tokens in the central hex, and a single starting token for each player in hexes of the host's choosing.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more moves can be made by either player, or after two successive passes. The player who occupies over half the board wins.&#10;&#10;Tumbleweed was voted Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2020 on BGG.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Repello, players try to score (1, 3 or 5) points by pushing (black, silver or gold) tokens off the board.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a stack of black tokens, and the game board is seeded with a variety of tokens. On a turn, a player moves his stack in any direction, with the distance traveled determined by the first number on which that player moves on his turn. The player leaves one token from his stack on the space that he vacated. If a player hits the edge of the playing space, his stack bounces off of it; if he hits another player's stack or a token on the board, that stack or token is pushed, ideally off the edge of the playing space, as opponents are penalized for being bumped.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Paris, XVIIth century. Cardinal Richelieu is centralizing power in the name of King Louis XIII and defends France against those he considers its enemies: the English, the protestants, the Habsburgs and French nobles scheming against him and the crown. Will you side with the cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the queen and foreign nations? Be warned that the cardinal will hinder too ambitious intrigants. Become an influent noble in the court by accumulating prestige and favors. The player most helpful to each faction is also rewarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Richelieu is a tactical game with a lot of bluff and interaction, with intrigue everywhere. Every instance of intrigue will pit Cardinal Richelieu against his enemies. The players are nobles taking sides in these intrigues by placing agents with secret values and thus influencing the intrigues. Will you choose to side with Richelieu or the conspirators &ndash; or perhaps even help both? You can keep your support secret or make it directly known to others when placing your agents at the intrigues. It costs money to place agents, but the winning faction gives higher rewards for the players that helped them the most.&#10;&#10;The Cardinal's mood is influenced by his success or failures, and he will become intolerant against too influential nobles (i.e. the players), who will have one fewer action to spend during a turn as a result.&#10;&#10;There are many possibilities and opportunities to score points for the player who foresees and thwarts the plans of other players. During the game, you will constantly have to choose your side: Will you side with the Cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the Queen and from foreign nations?&#10;&#10;Winner of Plateau d'or 2009!&#10;&#10;",

Win two rounds to become the new king or queen of the savannah.&#10;&#10;The card deck consists of 28 cards: 24 animal cards numbered 1-6 in four suits, and four eagle cards in a fifth suit.

The opponent must then play a card of the same suit, if possible. If they can't, they must play an eagle &mdash; and if they can't play an eagle, they can play anything. If the two cards played are of the same suit, the higher card wins. If the opponent played an eagle, they can make it flee (placing it in their own scoring pile and ceding the trick) or they can make it fight, winning the trick. If the opponent played off suit, the lead player wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads again. At the end of a trick, if you have a face-down card on top of a pile, reveal this card, making it available for play.&#10;&#10;The round ends when either a player collects their fourth hyena (losing the round immediately) or all cards have been played. In the latter case, count the crowns on collected cards to see who has the higher score. The first player to win two rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Damage is assessed by a die roll, and multiple hits are needed to bring down a plane unless a(n un)lucky shot strikes the cockpit or fuel tank. This is simple game that plays at jet speed!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Im Namen des Gesetzes &quot; contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

All effects are played to the React chain, which resolve only once both players pass on playing reactions, and resolve backwards: first in last out. Inspired heavily by the Yugioh Effect Chain and Magic Stack, Re;ACT aims to combine the crunchy competitive counter play of TCGs with the sleek approachability of modern board games.&#10;&#10;As you work to damage your opponent or control the board with your character and summons, you'll also be competing to finish your masterpiece before your opponent, a gorgeous 3 card spread of your character's greatest work. Doing so will grant you powers of your art form's truest expressions, and will be key to victory.&#10;&#10;",

Your score is based on the number of cards in all players' hands, with 0 being the best score possible. If you find the game difficult, you can include the tavern card that a few times each game allows a player to give limited information about their hand; if the game is too easy, you can remove some or all of the shrines to eliminate those &quot;extra&quot; bonuses.&#10;&#10;",

The blitzkrieg tactics first used in Poland, in 1939, had been put into action again&mdash;and perfected. For over six weeks the Allies, including the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), put up a staunch defense. Despite their defiance, they could not withstand the fierce onslaught of the German Wehrmacht, the fearless Fallschirmj&auml;gers and the notorious SS.&#10;&#10;Heroes in Defiance depicts the full range of the battles for France and the Low Countries, from the first Fallschirmj&auml;ger airborne assaults in Holland to the closing of the pocket of the BEF and the remnants of the French Army at the Channel ports. The module combines all the scenarios and components from Heroes of the Blitzkrieg and its expansion, In Defeat, Defiance, into a new and updated complete game in the Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series. Heroes in Defiance also adds five new scenarios (two previously unpublished) and eliminates the need for overlays with additional maps. It&rsquo;s the blitzkrieg of 1940 at its best!&#10;&#10;UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

    "Description": "Sail your fleet of galleons to the Murky Isles, hiding place for some of the greatest pirate treasures ever buried. Roll the Buccaneer Bones (landlubbers call them &quot;dice&quot;) to send ships out to sea. When you reach the island, you get a special bonus just for being there. But the best part is the treasure! Find the treasure and bring it back to port, then set sail again. The first pirate to bring back three treasures claims the title of &quot;Scourge of the Seven Seas&quot;! Arrrr!!!&#10;&#10;Each player in Buccaneer Bones starts with six ships on the six numbered ports of his player mat; each ship is in a sailing lane that consists of a port, a sea space, and an island. On a turn, the player rolls four dice, then rerolls as many as he wants; if he now has a pair, he advances the ship matching the number rolled one space (from port to sea or from sea to island) and if he has a three-of-a-kind, he advances the appropriate ship two spaces (from port to island). When a player has a ship on an island, he receives a bonus:&#10;&#10;&#10;    When on islands 1 or 6, he rolls one extra die; on islands 1 and 6, he rolls two extra dice.&#10;    When on islands 2 or 5, he can add or subtract one from a rolled die; on islands 2 and 5, he can do this twice.&#10;    When on islands 3 or 4, he can reroll any number of dice one extra time; on islands 3 and 4, he can reroll two extra times.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player has a ship on an island, if he has a three-of-a-kind matching that island number, the ship grabs one treasure, then returns to port.&#10;&#10;If a player can't advance a ship, he can place his first mate (1) as a scout on an island to grant himself that power on his next turn, (2) as a thief on a treasure owned by a player with more treasure than him, giving him a chance to steal it next turn if he rolls any three-of-a-kind, or (3) as a defender to remove a thief on one of his treasures.&#10;&#10;The game ends the round that a player collects his third treasure. If he's the only one with three treasures, he wins; if multiple players have three, then the tied player who has more ships farther from his ports wins.&#10;&#10;Buccaneer Bones includes a couple of play variants, including rules for a solo game.&#10;&#10;",
