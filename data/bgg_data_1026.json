    "Description": "Way of the Fighter - Fighter Packs are small packs of cards introducing two new fighters to the game, along with two new techniques for the existing styles.&#10;&#10;Aya is one of the last followers of the famous Hashashin, an assassin cult of ancient Persia. She is an extremely mobile fighter with the unique ability to move through her opponent and strike from behind, prior to them changing their facing. She is a perfect fit for aggressive and relentless players. Her mode card Shadow Veil further increases the damage actions she plays during a turn if she moves through the opponent&rsquo;s space that turn. Not all of her actions are reliant on her traversing through her opponent&rsquo;s space. Actions like Deadly Rhythm are mixed into her attacks just for such occasions when an opponent is too far away to get around them.&#10;&#10;Ranveer is a well-rounded master sikh warrior, his fighting form is methodical and strategical, thanks to his ability to see the action being played against him before committing dice. Unlike most fighters, Ranveer&rsquo;s actions primarily consist of very powerful modes. The power and effects of his modes are dependant on the number of power dice you roll to determine their priority scores. For example, Garuda&rsquo;s Swiftness can be discarded from play to increase the priority of an action before it is revealed. The increase is based on the amount of power dice that are on the mode when it is discarded. Nandi&rsquo;s Resilience can be discarded to prevent damage dealt to Ranveer.&#10;&#10;The Aya vs Ranveer fighter pack also comes with two sets of actions from the Counter technique and Acrobatic technique. The Counter technique for the Soft style makes heavy use of the Counter keyword which can prove very strong against a predictable opponent. The Acrobatic technique for the Fluid style supplements fighters who like to be in constant movement with an additional level of unpredictability and speed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For millennia armies have battled for control of the region known as the Flamescar Plateau, seeking to unearth its priceless treasures and hidden relics. Here lies a weapon of supreme destructive power, sought by armies from across the Mortal Realms. Whoever can harness its might will be gifted the power to utterly destroy their enemies. Yet claiming dominion over this war-torn land will be no simple task...&#10;&#10;In The Box&#10;&#10;This box contains everything you need to run a multiplayer campaign of Warhammer Age of Sigmar in the war-torn lands of the Flamescar Plateau. Whether you want to play Skirmish games, or massive, epic battles with thousands of points, this set makes it easy to organise, set up and play. It includes a large map of the Flamescar Plateau, divided into 23 regions for your campaign players to fight over &ndash; there are 256 map markers in the box, which are reusable stickers that can be peeled off and attached elsewhere as needed. Emphasis has been placed on speed when designing this box &ndash; we want your admin to be as minimal and fast as possible, so you can get on with actually playing through your campaign!&#10;&#10;In the included 64-page book, you&rsquo;ll find a brief history of the Realmgate Wars, along with descriptions of important Sigmarite cities and the Flamescar Plateau itself &ndash; the expansive region of the Realm of Fire, once ruled over by a magocracy known as the Agloraxi, over which your campaigns will be fought. It also features an extensive, easy to follow guide to actually running your campaigns &ndash; challenging opponents, picking a Battleplan, using Time of War Rules, how to use the included campaign cards, building garrisons and mustering your armies in the regions you control, and some special rules. These special rules add secret objectives allowing players to use some initiative and cunning, rules for trade and negotiation, and possible sudden death victories &ndash; these rules can drastically change the flow and outcome of a campaign. There are also 9 sets of Allegiance Abilities for use in the campaign &ndash; 6 of these represent the major Sigmarite cities found on the map, with one each for the forces of Death, Destruction and Chaos. These include battle traits, command traits and artefacts of power for your armies to use.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s also a set of 131 campaign cards &ndash; some of these, the Domain cards, are used to define the size of the armies that are fighting, and provide players with resources to call upon, such as points to spend on re-rolls and Stratagems; the others are used for special rules, and for keeping track of your Glory points &ndash; acquire these in order to win! The cards players are using are stored in one of the 4 provided card envelopes, coloured to match the 4 Grand Alliances.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is a simple way to introduce children to the world of route planning, helping them develop their logic and spatial intelligence skills, with 46 challenges.&#10;For each challenge, you need to work out the right route for getting your playing piece to its destination.&#10;Each scene has different coloured paths, interrupted by circular spaces.&#10;Look at the objectives on the game card, then take the number of bars indicated on the card to complete your route.&#10;Look at the different possible routes in the scene, then place the bars in the correct order on the white spaces on the game card.&#10;Move your piece in the same way you have placed the bars on the game card to see if you have plotted your route correctly.&#10;&#10;When you are more familiar with the game, you can challenge your friends to see who can complete the game card first. &#10;Playing side-by-side, each player takes 3 coloured bars. Take the CITY or PLANET scene of your choice, together with the appropriate playing piece and game cards. Place the scene and the playing piece in the centre of the table and put the game cards in a pile. Pick a game card from the pack, then place it in front of you. The players must try to solve the game card at the same time. To plot your course, place the bars closest to you directly onto the board (instead of on the card). When a player thinks they have found the right solution they must say &ldquo;STOP&rdquo;. If you have placed the bars on the board correctly you keep the card. If not, the other player gets to keep the card. Continue the game by choosing another game card. The winner is the first person to get 3 cards.&#10;&#10;",

Crimson Sands is set in an ancient fantasy world where giant lizards and large flightless birds are used to transport guards and goods between four cities separated by a hostile desert.  The birds are fast, but cannot carry much.   The lizards are slow, but can carry a great deal.&#10;&#10;The players must balance trade goods, guards, and water if their caravans are to reach the other side alive.  The game includes miniatures of the beasts that carry the tiles representing these guards, goods and the tiles representing raider opponents.&#10;&#10;Besides limited water, the principle danger in the desert is the raiders and their dread leader, the self-styled Raider Queen.   At the conclusion of their turn a player must draw an encounter card, view it secretly, and then decide where to place it on the game board.   Players can choose ever longer routes to avoid encounter cards or risk the hazard to take a direct route to their goal.&#10;&#10;If the raiders are encountered, battle will ensue.   The other players control the raiders in these fast-paced contests.   The defending player must decide how to best ward off attacks and get as many elements of the caravan to safety as possible.   The raiders have to decide whether to intercept and make off with individual beasts or try to eliminate all the guards and capture the entire caravan.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Featuring all original artwork inspired by Art Nouveau, Lygari! is a fun bluffing game for 3-6 players, where each player is one of the Einherjar in Valhalla boasting about their conquests!&#10;&#10;In Lygari!, there are 13 different monsters from Norse myth, and players take turns boasting about what creatures they have defeated in their previous life before coming to Valhalla. Cards are played face down, while players claim them to be one of the monsters in the game. It's up to other players to determine if each play is a bluff. Play continues until either one player has played all their cards, or the draw pile is exhausted.&#10;&#10;During their turn, players have a choice of making a boast, calling the previous player a Lygari, or just drinking mead. When making a boast, a player plays any number of cards from their hand, face down, and claims them to be one of the 13 monsters in the game. If the next player calls their bluff, the cards are revealed. If they matched the previous player's claim, the calling player must take all cards played so far into their hand, otherwise, the lying player takes all cards played into their hand. A player may instead opt to &quot;pass&quot; by drinking mead and drawing a card from the stock. When the mead runs out (all cards are drawn), whoever has the fewest cards left in their hand is the winner!&#10;&#10;Lygari! is the second in a series of games from Green Fairy Studios LLC in a shared setting of Mystique, where beings from ancient myth return to our modern day world. Lygari! highlights just some of the fantasical beings from Yggdrasil, the Nine Worlds of Norse myth!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If a player does meet an alligator, the player drops all their fish and is disqualified.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to mind out for the alligator while displaying your courage.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#189;&#143;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#183;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#165;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#173;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#229;&#184;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#165;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#233;&#173;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#164;&#177;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#186;&#166;&#232;&#131;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#164;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Fortune &amp; Folly, each player manages their own trading house in a fantasy world set roughly in the Elizabethan era. Grow your trading company by commissioning new ships and direct your fleets to win monopolies on key trade routes and harbors in a race to be recognized as the Queen&rsquo;s Royal Trading Company! &#10;&nbsp;&#10;SUMMARY: &#10;Fortune &amp; Folly is a worker management game with a rich nautical theme and very approachable rules. Event cards are drawn each turn and serve the dual purpose of normalizing game length and driving strategies that become more complex as players get more comfortable with the ecosystem at work in the game&rsquo;s mechanics. But getting into the adventure is easy. You start with three ships and move them between harbors and routes to score points based on the price of the goods moved over that route. Winning harbors allows you to place more ships and grow your fleet. When the last event card is resolved, the player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:&#10;Players start with a fleet of three ships on the board and can grow their fleet to ten by commanding monopolies on the harbor islands. Use trade ships to claim trade routes and gain Fortune points and direct pirates to harry your enemy company's efforts. Players will plan and then take each step of their turn with the help of their turn order card which includes a step to choose a world event card. Three of these events are shown next to the deck, so you'll have three shown options during this phase, or you can choose the top card of the deck at random. Once there are too few event cards to replenish the four options, the current player takes their turn and game is scored. Whoever has the most Fortune wins!&#10;&#10;Each turn you will:&nbsp;&#10;1) Draw and resolve a card&#10;2) Move a ship to a route or harbor island sharing a way point&nbsp;&#10;3/4) Optionally, you may get to make additional moves, or move pirate ships around&#10;5) Score points for routes you monopolize&nbsp;&#10;6) Place new ships for each harbor island you monopolize&#10;&#10;ATTRIBUTES:&#10;There are four dice, but they are used as counters for commodity prices.&nbsp;&#10;There are always the same number of turns because of the number of World Event cards and there's a mechanic called the Royal Court card that is used to speed up games that start to run a little longer due to players' deliberating more over their turns.  &nbsp;&#10;The World Event cards present the only real randomness in the game, but you'll always have four options (including the option to pick a card at random).&nbsp;&#10;A strategy guide is included in the rule book, so you can really hit the ground running.&#10;&#10;Designer Notes:&#10;This game is meant to be super easy to get learn, even for those just getting into the hobby, but to introduce layers as you become familiar with the mechanics. &#10;You'll be carefully planning your move and thinking like a shrewd trade company manager in no time! &#10;This game was developed over the course of almost two decades and we're so proud of how it turned out. Many thanks to Erwin Arozza for his contribution of stunning artwork that we think really brings the rich nautical, sometimes piratey, theme to life. We hope you'll have as much fun playing fortune &amp; Folly as we do!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Festival is the best opportunity to show your abilities to organize street performers into a festive force that can ignite the senses and imaginations of any audience throughout the realm. Can you capture the attention of the Queen and become the Busker Baron or Baroness?&#10;&#10;As a Busker Lord or Lady you must choose from a collection of royal street performers and outperform the other Busker Lords and Ladies who are simultaneously selecting their own performers. The Queen wants to see who can best manage their troop. After drafting your performers, your goal is to keep the most performers in your hand for the final encore. Your best chance is to convince the Festival's watching crowd and the other royal street performers that your troop is the best. If you have the most performers in your hand at the end of the game, you win Queen Indriana&rsquo;s royal contract and become the Busker Baron or the Busker Baroness for the next summer's Festival!&#10;&#10;",

Every team is made up of 4 Grunts and 1 General and the objective is to get your General and 1 of your Grunts into the Gold position and hold off your opponents for 1 turn while you seize it. Weapons can be found and used by collecting loot cards from the battlefield but this comes with the risk of springing booby traps so these must be collected with caution. Greed is bad but Gold is good!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Transmitted since ancient times, the tradition of the cursing ceremony called &bdquo;Ushi-no-Koku-Mairi&rdquo; (Ox-Hour Shrine-Visit) still persists, and the sound of hammer reverberates throughout the town at night. The curse accumulated in the land is summoning further calamities, and many tourist attractions are turning into haunted spots whirling with malice. People of unusual shapes cast their eyes upon the power of this curse, planning to get it for themselves. A suspicious chase for territory is about to begin!&#10;&#10;Moving around the map of the town, wander from one spiritual spot to another, pursuing your rivals. Collect the negative energies scattered over the different places, and use your powers. When it comes to the crunch, play your trump cards. You can use them either to escape or to stop the ones pursuing you. If you catch up with a rival, you will have a chance for a surprise attack. If you succeed, you can snatch away their powers. If you can steal the powers from everyone before daybreak, the game ends, with you as the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It is quite a scarce element in the game, therefore creating more tension and smart playing with new interaction in the temple, the production, and the Colossus site. The bonus track of the Colossus creates extra incentives for helping to build the Colossus and it creates interesting competition.&#10;&#10;As in Rhodes, The Colossus also creates interesting interaction and &quot;cooperative&quot; play, but still only one player can win this game. Now several tactics and strategies will give more options to the players to seize their victory in The Colossus.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As well as their Unit type these cards also have an attack characteristic, and an event characteristic.  These cards can be used in three different ways -  as a unit, to attack, or as an event.&#10;&#10;In addition there are Intel cards which do not function as a unit but will list an attack and an event, or two events.&#10;&#10;Cards being used as Units are kept face-up on the table in front of the controlling player. Cards put into play as units are said to be Deployed.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 5 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Logistics Phase &#10;         Draw 4 cards from the deck.&#10;    &#10;     Deploy Phase&#10;         You may put 1 unit card into play from your hand. &#10;    &#10;     Attack Phase&#10;         You may make 1 attack this phase by playing a card for its attack function.  The attack function of a card will specify attacker type and target type. (e.g. Infantry attacks Vehicle).   When a card is being used to attack, you must have the appropriate type of Unit in play (deployed) that can make the attack. The attack targets either the opponent&rsquo;s base or a specific type of Unit that the opponent has in play. As a result of the attack, the attack card is discarded and the target unit is discarded, or if the base was attacked, the target player will gain 1 damage for each unit that attacked.  The attacking unit(s) remain in play.  Some event cards will allow the defender to negate the Attack.&#10;    &#10;     Event Phase&#10;         You may play 1 event card this phase.  Discard the event card when played. &#10;    &#10;     Friction Phase&#10;         Max hand size is 5 cards. Give excess cards to one or more opponents. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Players are eliminated when they have accumulated 20 or more points of damage. The goal of the game is to be the last player standing.&#10;&#10;",

In doing so, they also try to protect their Darling, hoping to succeed in escaping with the money.&#10;&#10;During their turn the players try to play Excuses Cards that match with Boss&rsquo;s Mood. In order to do so, they have to use their imagination, by inventing stories that both match with the played Excuses Cards and sound credible. Be Careful! Every time that a player succeeds in Pass the Blame, the Suitcases Cards pass from one player to another.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player can&rsquo;t invent credible stories anymore, the Boss looses his patience and dispenses his fair Judgement against both the unlucky player and his/her protector. At this point the game ends and the player who owns the Bag with the Cash can slip away with the money. However, if the Bag with the Cash was in the hands of the accused player of in those of his/her protector, the Boss gets the money back and wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;la Borsa con il malloppo &egrave; sparita.

Nel farlo, cercano anche di proteggere il proprio Prediletto, nella speranza di riuscire a scappare con il malloppo.&#10;&#10;Durante il proprio turno i giocatori cercano di utilizzare le Carte Scusa dalla propria mano per riuscire a giocarne una che combaci con l&rsquo;Umore del Boss. Per farlo si &egrave; costretti a lavorare di fantasia, inventado storie che, non solo devono rispettare gli spunti delle Carte Scusa giocate, ma devono anche risultare plausibili. Ma attenzione! Ogni volta che un giocatore riesce a Scaricare la Colpa su di un altro giocatore, le  Carte Borse passano da un giocatore all&rsquo;altro.&#10;&#10;Quando un giocatore non &egrave; in pi&ugrave; grado di raccontare scuse credibili, il Boss perde completamente le staffe ed emette la sua Sentenza contro il povero malcapitato e contro il suo protettore.

    "Description": "Renown - The Game brings back a traditional Austrian card game. The original game is still played in Austria but it is getting more and more forgotten. Decades ago there were many tournaments and it was played in almost every tavern. It is called &ldquo;Schnapsen&rdquo;, probably because the winner was rewarded with a shot of schnapps. We have modernized it with a lot of modifications, action and player interactions. We have added a set of action cards which can alter the whole gameplay.&#10;&#10;Renown - The Game features four different races: the bloodthirsty Ogres, the forsaken Humfrogs, the greedy Goblins and the schnapps-loving Shiners&#10;&#10;Be the first one to earn 48 points by beating your enemies in different round types to win the game. Send your characters into fights and gather 66 Renown which you need to get your beloved points.&#10;&#10;To reward the best strategic player there are seven different round types, which give you more points, the more difficult your strategy is to follow. Some of the rounds require you to earn 66 Renown fast, others will challenge you to win all the fights.&#10;&#10;Each race has five different characters, who are ranked like this: The Chief, the Warden, the Sorceress, the Soldier and the Dork.&#10;&#10;You start each round by selecting a dominating race, which makes every member of this race stronger than any card of the other races. When a player plays a character, the other players usually have to follow with the same race, if they have one. The higher ranked characters beat the lower ranked ones. This means: The chief beats everyone from the warden to the dork, the warden beats everyone from the sorceress to the dork and so on. If a player does not have a card of the first played race, he has to play one of the dominating race. If the player does not have a card of the dominating race either, he needs to send another race into the fight. However, this one cannot beat the first played card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beyond a Cheese strategy game!&#10;&#10;Located at the heart of Minas Gerais state, Serra da Canastra is a certified region where one of the most traditional raw milk cheese has been produced since colonial times. &#10;Canastra&acute;s cheese is a hidden treasure little known outside Brazil. &#10;Until very recently, it&acute;s only been made by a few exclusive and certified producers. Now it is time for you to make a change in this game.&#10;&#10;Your challenge is to make your small company grow and become the best among all cheesemongers, admired and certified with loads of Prestige Points.&#10;&#10;Players must produce, pick up, deliver, and hopefully guide as many Tourists they can to appreciate those great cheese and other typical products such as coffee, P&atilde;o de Queijo and Dulce de Leche.&#10;&#10;And remember, there is always someone else ready to profit from your cheese!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=============Canastra is a competitive open information strategy game for 2 to 5 businessmen.&#10;&#10;The game is played in four rounds. &#10;Every round has 3 phases: a) income; b) Actions; and c) Quality level.&#10;&#10;A) Income of Action Cubes&#10;Built Farms on the board produce a milk token and a typical product cube.&#10;Players always get 7 Action Cubes and may get plus cubes, up to 4 units, for each Farm Bonus tile with a milk token they have.&#10;&#10;B) Following turn order, players use their Action Cubes to take only one action per turn, until everyone has passed.&#10;Some actions spend more Action Cubes than others. The action of producing cheese may not spend action cubes at all if a player has all the necessary ingredients.&#10;&#10;There are eight Actions available: Produce Cheese, Pickup items, Deliver items, Guide Tourists, Build a Farm, Movement, Draw an Online Request Card, and Pass.&#10;&#10;C) Raise the Quality Level of one Region&#10;A Specialist meeple is placed on the Region that has produced more cheese according to the production track. &#10;The player with more influence, counting Crafter meeples, the Truck, Cheese packages, and Farms, receive Prestige Points and a Quality Certificate tile that give endgame prestige points. &#10;The Region increases its Quality value. This has impact on the price of Cheese when picked up, and also values all the Farms on that same Region.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=============&#10; &#10;There is not a money representation on this game. No coins. &#10;All the commercial transactions give players Prestige Points.&#10;The way Prestige Points are gained during the game is very  intertwined with players actions.&#10;&#10;------------------------- &#10;Replayability of Canastra focus on the setup of the board, on several different Farm bonus tiles available, where each player may build up to four Farms, the various ways of getting Prestige Points, and also the interaction among players during the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A colorful space exploration board game produced in post-war France. The object of the game is to travel through the solar system landing on the planets and moon and collecting valuable ore or precious stones. The winner is the player with the most valuable riches upon returning to earth.&#10;&#10;The game requires players to choose a spaceship that looks more like a plane and traverse the solar system by the move of a single die along a path of small white stars. The journey takes them on a path to the Moon, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter before returning to Earth.&#10;&#10;Whats interesting about the game is that 3 of the planets (Venus, Jupiter and Mars) rotate slowly during play by turning a disk and players have to align their ship towards the next path to move onto another planet.&#10;&#10;On arrival on the moon and planets players acquire cards with valuable ore and gemstones. The value of each card is determined by who arrives there first.&#10;&#10;The other interesting feature is a fast moving comet that orbits the players course by the throw of 2 dice. If a player collides with the comet a penalty such as loss of riches or even elimination from the game occurs.&#10;&#10;After collecting the precious cargo from the planets and returning to Earth players are awarded bonus cards in order of arrival. The player with the largest value is deemed the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Five Nights At Freddy's is based off of the very popular game app with the same name.  The board game version is a jump scare game that will surely make you jump!  You take mini pizza's from the tray in front of Freddy Fazbear.  Watch out, because if you mess around with his pizza's too much he JUMPS!&#10;&#10;Basic Game Play&#10;You set the game up by pressing Freddy into a locked position.  Take all the total of 24 mini plastic pizza pieces in red (8) blue (8) and yellow (8) and put them in the pizza tray/box in front of Freddy.&#10;&#10;Time to turn Freddy on, once you do that, you will hear the haunting  Calliope style music plays in the main base of the game.&#10;&#10;Each player on their turn spins the multi colored spinner which has corresponding colors to the pizza slices - Each slice on the spinner has a number value.  That is the number of pieces you have to remove from the tray in front of Freddy.  On the dial there is also a skip a turn, but in this game that is a good thing!&#10;&#10;The players uses a bear paw shaped salad style tongs (grey in color) to pick the pizza slices out by the color and quantity shown on the spinner.  As you reach in, there is a lower level tray bottom that is pressure sensitive and will slowly based on the number of times you agitate, randomly activate Freddy to jump at you and spill the pizzas all over the table top!&#10;&#10;(If at any time a color is spun that is not in the tray, a player must take another color pizza instead)&#10;&#10;The winner is the one that does not find themselves the unlucky person that made Freddy JUMP!&#10;&#10;If playing more then two players, then the person that makes Freddy jump is eliminated.  Players return the pizza back to the tray, set Freddy up again and continue playing in the same manner.&#10;&#10;Once it is down to two players, then the overall winner is the one that does not set Freddy to JUMP!&#10;&#10;(If the players remove all of the pizza before Freddy wakes, then the game ends in a tie)&#10;&#10;Requires 3 AA Batteries&#10;&#10;",
