The battlefield consists of six lanes, each with three sectors, radiating out from the tower. On these lanes, the orcish hordes will try to charge all the way towards the tower. Your job is to defeat them before they can reach you.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game round players draw a fate card, which will determine which category of creatures will advance one sector towards the tower and sometimes implement a nasty rule change for that particular game round. There are three categories of orcs which differ in strength and special abilities that are conveyed to a player once an orc is defeated.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you run out of orcs on one of the four lanes. During the final scoring, players count up their defeated orcs and multiply them by the number on the creature counter, get points for each support spell learned and subtract points for each poison card in their deck. Whoever has the most points will be declared &quot;Master Mage&quot;!&#10;&#10;",

The game includes wooden segments that the players can add to cards to adjust their value. The amount of unused segments a player has will determine their bid for the round.&#10;&#10;For instance, a segment placed horizontally across a &quot;0&quot; will create an &quot;8&quot;.  More exotic options are also possible, as three segments placed on a &quot;7&quot;, played upside down&quot;, can create a &quot;6&quot;.&#10;&#10;The trick-taking phase uses a &quot;must follow&quot; format, with a fixed trump suit.&#10;&#10;At the end of a hand, players will score points if they have taken a number of tricks equal to exactly the amount of unused segments they have leftover.  They will score for both the tricks taken as well as segment pieces that were played on cards in those tricks.  The game also includes a &quot;mis&egrave;re&quot; scoring option, where a player who takes no tricks and uses all of their segments may also score points.&#10;&#10;&#10;Twinkle Starship[Story]&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s time for a crazy race that encompasses the entire universe to begin, where anything goes. Racers have assembled from different planets with their proud spaceships. Their machines of quality are crafted with invaluable ore unique to each of their planets.

In the game, you will be utilizing small segment sticks to control and manipulate the numbers of the cards, just like matchstick puzzles. For example, you can add one segment to 0 to make it 8, or add three segment to 1 to make it 3. This is a must-follow game with an unorthodox bidding system. Only when the amount of the sticks you have left at the end of a game and the number of tricks you won are matching, you are allowed to score points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Myrgos, the powerful and benevolent Dragon King has passed into the next world after an extended illness, and the land is now gripped with uncertainty.&nbsp;As the laws of succession dictate, only one of his remaining apprentices can rise to the position of &quot;Draco Magi&quot;.&#10;&#10;With the death of the Draco Magi, the wizard-lock on the succession strongbox of each apprentice has completely dissipated. Inside each box, an apprentice will find a succession scroll. Contained on the scroll is the last piece of knowledge required to become the Drago Magi &mdash; but only one can claim the title. Each scroll holds a different &quot;Spell of Succession&quot; that may be executed only with the correct combination of rare gems. These magically imbued gems appear in sets of three only during times of succession and must be collected by dragons at the command of each apprentice. The competitor who is first to collect the gems needed to complete his Spell of Succession becomes the new Drago Magi. For the loser, the unofficial title whispered under the breath of the people is &quot;Novitius Eterna&quot; or &quot;Forever a Novice&quot;.&#10;&#10;Be swift and remember, there is little room for error.&#10;&#10;Draco Magi is a card game designed by Richard Launius and Robert Burke. To start, each player selects an apprentice dragon mage he wishes to play. Each mage receives a deck of dragon cards that includes multiple copies of four different chromatic dragons (Green, Red, Black &amp; Purple), four different metallic dragons (Gold, Silver, Brass &amp; Bronze), and two special dragon cards (the Battle dragon and the Polar dragon). Each dragon has a different strength, weakness and special ability. Players will send their dragons, one at a time, to capture gems on different battlefields; each battlefield offers a different effect that may give an advantage or disadvantage to certain types of dragons.&#10;&#10;Players alternate playing dragon cards on battlefields until they have played all eight of their Dragon cards. Each player can play a maximum of three dragons on a single battlefield. When a dragon is placed, it may make a ranged attack. Not all dragons have a ranged attack breath weapon, but those that do have a breath weapon icon with a number. The number indicates the number of battle cards the player may reveal when attempting to hit with a ranged attack. A defender may defend with the number of cards equal to the dragon's shield value. A ranged attack can take place immediately only when the card is played against an opposing dragon. If a ranged attack is not used at this moment, the ranged attack is forfeited for the current round.&#10;&#10;After all dragon cards have been played, the melee phase of the battle begins. Each dragon has a &quot;melee attack&quot; value printed on its card which represents the number of battle cards the player can draw for the battle. The melee battle mechanism is a unique attack and counter system that provides opportunity for deduction, subtlety, and deadly combos. Players will also earn advance battle cards that build up their decks over the course of the game. The player with the most dragons present on a battlefield wins that gem. In the case of a tie, the dragons and gem remain for the next round.&#10;&#10;Draco Magi is a fast game heavily connected to its theme that incorporates area control, bluffing, hand management, deck building and deduction.&#10;&#10;",

The cards represent 4 different types of valuable goods and caravan handlers.&#10;&#10;Gold is collected along the path and at the midpoint of the game and the end (when the first player reaches Kantschou and then Daidu). The player reaching Kantschou first receives 6 gold, anyone in the next space receives 5 gold, and so on down to 1 gold. After the first scoring round, all players start together again at Kantschou. The first player to reach Daidu receives 7 gold, next space 6, then 5 and so on.&#10;&#10;Play is by matching cards from hand to requirements in next free space (e.g. one of each good or 3 cards the same colour). Caravans tend to leap frog forward, so one player's move changes the requirements for the next. In each turn, a player may move as often as they can match from their hand. For those really stuck with a poor hand, 1 gold will move your caravan one place forward, but only so long as they aren't the leading caravan.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, the active player draws one of five face-up cards or a random card from the draw pile to replenish their hand.&#10;&#10;The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Special units such as airmobile, airborne, and amphibious troops, with their abilities to outflank a line, become even more important.&#10;Another important feature is the tangled web of Balkan politics, Romania is the least reliable of the Pact countries, and its participation is half-hearted at best. A second scenario allows for its total neutrality, forcing the Soviets to reinforce their armies and invade before taking on NATO. Greece and Turkey are uneasy allies, and rules allow for Greek withdrawal from NATO. And Albania is completely unpredictable.&#10;&#10;Additional rules allow Southern Front to be combined with The Third World War: Battle for Germany; players can reinforce one front with forces from the other, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to the Balkans can turn the tide there, but at what cost to the main front, where every unit is desperately needed ?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Over all of Spain, the sky is clear.&quot;&#10;&#10;On July 17, 1936, this phrase was broadcast throughout Spain, signaling the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, one of the bloodiest civil wars of the modern era, and what could be considered the beginning of World War II. Within a day, one third of Spain was under the control of Nationalist forces attempting to stage a military coup. Over the next three years, what began as a military rebellion evolved into the physical battle lines of the much larger ideological conflict spreading across Europe between Fascism and Communism.&#10;&#10;Popular Front recreates this conflict in 90-minute strategy game form, leading players to compete against their ideological counterparts not only for military positioning, but for political victory. Players must be concerned about the position of their forces on the board, but the composition of a player's hand will affect their success in combat more often than not. Plays with two, four, or six players split into two teams. Players each have an identical 20-card deck (with unique, original propaganda posters actually used in the war) that results in the use of your cards being more important than the luck of the draw. Strategic thinking, trickery, teamwork, and a dash of courage are what lead to victory in Popular Front.&#10;&#10;",

Could this ragged, think line of Australians, South African, Free French, and British infantry continue to hold against the Desert Fox's veteran troops?&#10;&#10;There could be no retreat  There could be no hope of relief.  The British faced the Germans in the desert with their backs to the sea.  This was the battle for North Africa, the conquest of a continent.  This was the most famous siege in the annals of modern warfare  This was the battle for TOBRUK&#10;&#10;Now, you can re-create all of the furious action of tank-to-tank battles on the Western Desert during World War Two.&#10;&#10;NINETEEN DIFFERENT GAME SITUATIONS are provided to enable you to re-create all facets of the decisive Gazala battle-Rommel's most spectacular victory that lead directly to his most spectacular defeat at El Alamein only a few months later.

Players construct movies from game cards that they draft or purchase. Players compete to get the most popular stars to perform in their movies because this brings them more money and more Hollywood Awards (which are pictured on some cards).&#10;&#10;First, players take turns choosing cards with the aid of drafting. Second, players purchase additional star cards (the strongest cards in the game) at the auction. Third, each player uses his nine cards in hand to make one or several movies. A movie must have a minimum of three cards: a Script, a Director and an Actor (or Actress). Additional cast members are optional, but they add to a movie's total box office. Quality films bring a large amount of profit to the player.&#10;&#10;Players go through three production years, then after the third year Hollywood Awards bring extra money to the players, and the richest player wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged is a solitaire game covering the pivotal World War II years of the mid-1940 through 1942 period in the often overlooked Battle for the Mediterranean. You are placed in the role of the Commonwealth Commander in the theatre, and must utilize every resource at your disposal to fend off unrelenting Axis attacks in order to ensure the survival of the island of Malta.&#10;&#10;Built upon the same States of Siege engine as the designer's previous 2010 Charles S. Roberts award-winning release (We Must Tell the Emperor), Malta Besieged features both familiar and innovative game play. Supply was the key element in the Mediterranean Campaign, and so it is here as well. Players will have to safely shepherd vulnerable convoys - and their valuable cargoes - in order to effectively wage war. With the ability to trade Supply for extra Actions at the most crucial moments, this places an additional emphasis on that precious resource and also creates extremely tense convoy battles which will resolve as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;ULTRA is a crucial asset in the game, but beware of Axis counterintelligence! Spitfires can rule the skies, Gibraltar can block U-Boat advances, Operation Herkules is a constant threat, and Admiral Cunningham himself can intervene on occasion.&#10;&#10;North Africa is not treated as a mere sideshow; indeed, the struggle with Rommel, the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;, holds the ultimate key to victory... if Malta can hold out against the constant pressure. If a fortified Tobruk manages to stubbornly delay the vaunted Afrika Korps long enough, then General Montgomery and his battle-tested 8th Army can possibly make a final dash from El Alamein to capture Tripoli and secure a glorious triumph.&#10;&#10;Raiding Axis supply lines to weaken Rommel's Situation, scrambling Hurricanes to provide Air Support for inbound shipping, attacking the Italians early before the dreaded Luftwaffe arrives, requesting British Fleet escort for your individually named convoys, and maintaining the morale of a battered Malta are just some of the important decisions to be made throughout the game. Numerous theatre-wide events such as The Fall of France, O'Connor's desert offensive, the daring raid on the Italian Fleet at Taranto, the Air Assault on Crete, the evacuation from Greece, the sinking of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, and the Torch landings are all abstracted via card play, and can have a significant impact on the overall conduct of the war.&#10;&#10;With That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged, it's all here - the only question is will you have the wisdom, leadership, fortitude, and luck to prevail? Play this game and find out!&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;Game Length: 75 minutes&#10;Scale: Each unit is one Axis Front, each turn is a variable number of days or weeks.&#10;&#10;NOTE: The game is currently out-of-print.&#10;&#10;",

As the tally of encirclements and surrenders mounts, the German advance appears unstoppable to Hitler and many others. However, the officers and men at the front are beginning to have serious misgivings -- not in themselves, but in the pre-war intelligence estimates that they had received. They had not been prepared to encounter hundreds of KV-1's and T-34's, tanks far superior to anything they possessed. For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners. Worse yet, by western European standards, Russian losses had been so staggering that there should have been no army left to fight. Not so. There seemed to be no end to these tenacious Russian defenders. As the German forces continued their eastward advance, more and more soldiers began asking, &quot;What have we gotten ourselves into?&quot;&#10;&#10;Kiev, the first major German objective in the south, did not fall on schedule. In fact, Soviet resistance was so fierce that it required diverting Guderian's Panzer Group away from the advance on Moscow. Kiev fell in one of the greatest encirclements of the Second World War, but the German advance on Moscow was delayed for several critical weeks. Quite possibly the delay at Kiev might have cost the German forces victory in the battle for Moscow.&#10;&#10;840 full-color two-sided counters.  &#10;MAPS   &#10;Three 22x34&quot; and one 17x22&quot; full-color mapsheets  &#10;OTHER  One 10-sided die &#10;36-page Rule Book &#10;36-page Play Book &#10;Player Aid Cards: four two-sided Soviet Set-Up cards, four two-sided Axis Set-Up cards, Soviet Status card, Axis Status card, two 11x17 two-sided game chart cards, two cards of additional scenario charts. &#10; Eight scenarios allow players to vary their level of involvement, complexity, and starting point, from introductory to full campaign &#10;An asymmetrical sequence of play that highlights Axis armored breakthroughs and Soviet difficulties in combined arms warfare &#10;Detailed air rules that integrate with land combat and weather rules &#10;Incredibly detailed orders of battle, including special coverage of artillery, rocket artillery, engineers, bridge units, armored trains, and much more &#10;Modifications to the proven Typhoon system include revised overrun and Soviet surrender procedures, as well as a new non-op Soviet HQ system to simulate the rigid yet fragile Soviet Command structure &#10;Extensive bibliography and design/historical notes&#10;&#10;Scenarios include;&#10;&#10;Scenario #1 &quot;Assault on Kiev&quot; which uses a portion of map G.

A fully cooperative, campaign-driven, miniatures board game, Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay tells the story of 5 heroes from the Wanderer's Guild, and their struggle to free the small fishing town of Barnacle Bay from the slimy claws of Elder Bane. Driven mad by power, and physically twisted from dark magic, Elder Bane has created a cult of mutated townsfolk that only desire to spread their message of madness to the rest of the world, bending it to their whim along the way.&#10;&#10;In Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay, players will select one of five unique heroes, outfit their hero with starting gear (represented by mini cards on a player dashboard), and join their friends to take back Barnacle Bay. Defeating foes and surviving random encounters earns players experience points and loot. Loot, like weapons and armor, is a persistent upgrade, staying with the heroes as they continue on their adventure. Experience points are used to level up heroes during their current adventure in the campaign. A dual-facing upgrade tree allows players to continually try new combinations of skills each adventure to determine what fits their play style, or current set of foes, best.&#10;&#10;Using a modular board, players assemble maps as indicated in the campaign book, then use action points to move or attack with their hero.&#10;&#10;All enemies in the game are controlled by a simple line of sight A.I., and automatically hit the players' heroes once they're able to. This means there is no player rolling for success for enemies' attacks. Heroes will, however, be able to roll for defense in an effort to prevent incoming wounds. One set of custom dice determines a hero's success for both defending and attacking. Random encounter cards, which are revealed when players enter an  unexplored &quot;darkness&quot; space, also promise that no campaign adventure is ever be the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Published and packed with Operational Matters: An OCS Guide (w/ Sicily II game).&#10;&#10;(from the publisher:)&#10;&#10;Sicily II is a full-sized game covering the amphibious invasion of that island in the summer of 1943. This new edition is quite different from Dean Essig's original game from back in 2000. It features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and a new map. The most obvious change is in scale: hexes are now 3.5 miles across and there are two turns per week (the original had 2.5-mile hexes and four turns per week). This makes for a smaller, faster game that conforms to the scale chosen for Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe and the upcoming games set in Western Europe. We think Sicily II is a perfect way to give new recruits their baptism in the fire of OCS, and is also a worthy entry in the series for players who have already earned their stripes.&#10;&#10;Here are some of the game&rsquo;s highlights:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The entire campaign lasts just 16 turns.&#10;     There are six scenarios in all (three using the entire map, and three using just a portion).&#10;     The Allied airborne fiasco is recreated with simple scatter rules. &#10;     The amphibious landings can be played out using standard OCS naval rules, or players can mostly skip these and begin with the bulk of Allied forces already ashore.&#10;     The Luftwaffe&rsquo;s Do.217K makes its series debut, armed with exotic Fritz-X missiles.&#10;     Rules for Italian unit wavering and surrender make every game different.&#10;     Several interesting options are provided, including revised Axis deployment and variable entry of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 3 to 4 days&#10;Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km&#10;Units: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;    Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 16-page Sicily II rules booklet&#10;&#10;&#10;Players will have to use OCS v4.2 rulebook/charts &amp; tables for another OCS game or download them from http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ocs.htm&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 Hours&#10;&#10;",

Points are earned for defeating enemy cards and taking objectives, but combat can result in lost cards and the dilution of the deck with disorganized cards providing a tense &quot;deck survival&quot; experience.&#10;&#10;Combat includes small arms fire, suppression fire, bazookas, gammon grenades, anti-tank guns, indirect artillery support and air strikes. German cards represent the actual forces and terrain present including personnel from Ost battalions and static divisions, armored cars, STUGs, blockhouses, Rommel's asparagus and flooded fields. The objective cards represent the actual causeways, locks, artillery positions, headquarters and other locations that were assigned and have features unique to each.&#10;&#10;Assign your airborne cards to one of three areas: The Battleground, Support Area, or the Reserve. Weigh the cost of buying time with your troopers against suffering reverses in order to get more and better equipped men. Do you take the mortar from the drop zone for its firepower or a high ranking officer for his additional actions? Only the airborne commander can decide.&#10;&#10;Airborne Commander First Printing includes two full color decks each in its own tuck box.

He escaped alive from the jaws of that shark-headed abomination in human form &hellip;- Harry was explaining at the same time he was miming with all his body doing so, acting out the scene with his eyes moving all directions as if they were about to jump off his face, in a way of magnifying the facts.&#10;&#10;-I would not like to lose my leg&hellip;or my arm, or any other limb from my body.

Each character will use different abilities to solve mysteries in each scenario or island (by means of modular boards) to fulfill secondary missions; they will roll dice and play cards in order to move, fight enemies or sail depending of how many PP they still have left.

Those drawn during fall and winter are advantageous for the Beast.&#10;    The Beast secretly chooses where to strike next and can use special powers (but risks being cut off that power for the rest of the game and can even risk having its identity revealed and loosing the game).&#10;    The investigators choose where they move (their presence can also protect the location from the Beast)&#10;    The Beast reveals its location and the number of victims depends on the distance traveled, the NPCs present on site, if a special power was applied and if any investigator is there or not.&#10;    Investigators present in a location visited by the Beast during the past 2 seasons can investigate its traces to see if they can cut the Beast off one of its power or even find out its secret identity.&#10;&#10;&#10;---&#10;The Beast of G&eacute;vaudan is the historic name associated with a man-eating animal (or animals) that terrorised the former province of G&eacute;vaudan (consisting of the modern-day department of Loz&egrave;re and part of Haute-Loire as well as the Auvergne and south Dordogne areas of France), in the Margeride Mountains of southern-central France between 1764 and 1767. The attacks, which covered an area spanning 90 by 80 kilometres (56 by 50 mi), were said to have been committed by one or more beasts with formidable teeth and immense tails, according to contemporary eyewitnesses. Most descriptions from the period identify the beast as a striped hyena, wolf, dog, or wolf-dog hybrid.&#10;&#10;Victims were often killed by having their throats torn out. The Kingdom of France used a considerable amount of money and manpower to hunt the animals responsible, including the resources of several nobles, soldiers, royal huntsmen, and civilians. The number of victims differs according to the source. A 1987 study estimated there had been 610 attacks, resulting in 500 deaths and 49 injuries; 98 of the victims killed were partly eaten. Other sources claim the animal or animals killed between 60 and 100 adults and children and injured more than 30. The beast was reported killed several times before the attacks finally stopped.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, the active player voices his suspicions in the form of a sentence &ndash; &quot;I suspect ....... of having been seen at ....... at around ....... hundred in possession of .......&quot; &ndash; filling in the blanks with one of the eight possibilities in each category. All players then secretly note whether or not they hold the evidence card for one of the four things named by placing a verdict card inside a folder. The active player shuffles these folders to disguise who answered in which ways, then reveals them. If all four items guessed were false, then you cover those four guesses on the game board with Holmes' business cards; otherwise players mentally note how many of the items were correct and try to decipher which ones those might be.&#10;&#10;Players then participate in a deduction round in which each player can:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a deduction token on a clue.&#10;    Say &quot;I pass&quot;.&#10;    Attempt an accusation.&#10;&#10;&#10;If all players pass successively, the round ends and the next player in clockwise order then voices a suspicion. Otherwise a player can pass, then place a deduction token or attempt an accusation later in the same round.&#10;&#10;Each player has nine deduction tokens in his color, three each of 0, 1 and 2. To place a token, you place it face-down on the clue of your choice to the right of any tokens already present; if any of those tokens are face-down, you reveal those tokens. At most four tokens can be placed on a clue.&#10;&#10;To attempt an accusation, you say, &quot;I accuse (suspect) of having been been seen at (place) at around (time) in possession of (object)&quot;, then all players submit their verdict cards the same way they normally do. If all of them are positive, you've solved the case &ndash; but not necessarily won the game. All tokens on incorrect clues and all tokens belonging to players who made a false accusation are removed, then players tally the numbers on their tokens, scoring bonus points if they have a token on each piece of evidence, or if they made a correct suspicion or accusation. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;With three or five players, you decrease (increase) the number of evidence cards handed out at the start of the game and the number of tokens that can be placed on a clue.&#10;&#10;",

In Posthuman, you journeyed to the last bastion of organized human society in the area: The Fortress. A year down the line, you have become an active part of that society and honed the skills you need to fulfill your role there, but the mutants are gaining ground...&#10;&#10;Posthuman Saga is a standalone survival game in the Posthuman universe. You play a seasoned member of the Fortress' militia, sent out beyond the defensive perimeter to explore and hopefully reconnect with outposts the Fortress has lost touch with, while searching for scavengable sites along the way. You have to forge across a crumbled land where resources are spare and mutants roam the ruined mansions and forests alike.&#10;&#10;Like the initial Posthuman, this is a sandbox-style survival journey, but the game system in Posthuman Saga differs from that of the first game in the series. Players win by  completing various objectives that suit different characters and playing styles. It has an emphasis on tactical choices on two levels: the journey expressed through an innovative modular tile map puzzle and the individual  story and combat encounters. The latter are fast, card-based affairs involving tough choices with future consequences. Posthuman Saga boasts over one hundred, finely crafted story scenes with a simple, push-your-luck mechanism that supplements the emergent narrative afforded by the game. Mutation is a way of life in the Posthuman world, and it can have its advantages, but it can easily get out of control...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "City building has never been so easy: Just roll the dice, then build a building. However, each die must be selected carefully to fit the building requirements. Push your luck too far &ndash; or select carelessly &ndash; and a player may find himself demolishing his city instead of building it up. Choose each die wisely and build efficiently in order to erect magnificent skyscrapers and create the best skyline!&#10;&#10;Skyline is a quick push-your-luck dice game involving set collection. Unlike other dice games that provide no relationship from turn to turn and no player interaction, this game allows players to literally build upon their decisions each turn and react to their opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose to roll dice from either the Construction Yard or the Abandoned District, with the goal of erecting urban buildings. Buildings are made up of three types of dice: Ground Floor dice, Mid-Floor dice and Penthouse dice. Some buildings are safer to build but provide little reward, while other buildings have poor probabilities but can have substantial impact on the success of a player's skyline.&#10;&#10;After rolling their selected dice, the player must use at least one of these dice to take one of three possible actions: Abandon, Build, or Cancel Construction. The Build action is the desired outcome, of course, but can be carried out only if the die result matches what they need to build. For instance, all Ground Floor dice can be built without restriction, but a High-Rise Mid-Floor die result can be built only on top of a High-Rise Ground Floor die. Likewise, a Mid-Rise Penthouse die can be built only on a Mid-Rise Mid-Floor die. If the rolled results do not allow them to Build, then the player must Cancel Construction on one of their existing buildings. If a player does not want to Cancel Construction, then they must Abandon by placing that die in the Abandoned District, which gives their opponents the opportunity to capitalize on this failure.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, points are rewarded for completed buildings according to their height. A Level 3 building &ndash; that is, a building comprised of three dice &ndash; is worth 9 points, while a Level 4 building is worth 16, and so on.&#10;&#10;Remember, the dice control the results...but the players control the dice.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tiny Turbo Cars is a frantic race game for 2 to 4 players in which you program the movements of your tiny toy car in advance, with a sliding puzzle acting as your remote controller.&#10;&#10;Choose your car, grab your remote controller, create the track, and get ready to race! At the beginning of each round, players have to work their way through their sliding puzzle controllers simultaneously, trying to create the sequence of actions they want their car to perform during the round.&#10;&#10;Each symbol on the puzzle corresponds to one of the possible actions &mdash; but only the two middle rows of commands on your controllers will be applied, so there's room for maneuvers, but be quick! The first player to put down their controller will be the first to move their car during the round. Each player then executes the program they created, and the sooner you play during a round, the safer you are that your actions will actually play out as planned rather than crashing into unexpected obstacles...or other cars!&#10;&#10;But trying to be quick might also increase your chances of making mistakes, and every time you take damage, you lose battery power, which will slow you down. But hey, mistakes happen, right? You can always recharge and be back in the race.&#10;&#10;This is a fierce race, with pitfalls around every corner and unscrupulous adversaries! Don't miss your chance to shoot your missiles at your opponents &mdash; before they hit you! The first player to cross the finish line wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The players play one to four characters from the Iron Kingdoms universe as they try to weed out a nefarious evil that has been lurking in the Undercity of Corvis.&#10;&#10;All players will be playing on the same team and the game requires no game master. The players work together defeating enemies, achieving objectives, and gaining experience that can be used to give new skills to their characters that can be used in subsequent adventures in the campaign.&#10;&#10;The game will come with almost 40 different miniatures with 16 different sculpts. The four heroes are Milo Boggs (the alchemist), Canice Gormleigh (the gun mage), Gardek Stonebrow (a trollkin warrior), and Pog (a gobber mechanic) that controls a light warjack named Doorstop.&#10;&#10;Each character has a starting stat sheet, but players can purchase character ability cards with XP gained from the adventure to enhance and customize their characters.&#10;&#10;Combat is based on rolling dice against opposing attributes. Players will be able to use feats and abilities to give boosts to these dice rolls, similar in many ways to other games based in the Iron Kingdoms.&#10;&#10;",

Command audacious American and British paratroopers and glider troops in daring missions against stalwart defensive positions and fiendish counterattacks by the German Wehrmacht, SS, and Fallschirmj&auml;gers.&#10;&#10;Infantry squads and intrepid individuals, such as skilled Leaders and Heroes, are at the core of the LnL Tactical Series. With them you can fire M1919A4, Vickers, MG34, and MG42 machine guns; take aim at approaching tanks with Bazookas, Piats, and Panzerfausts; and find the range with heavy mortars and numerous anti-tank guns, from the American 57mm to the dreaded German 88mm. Vehicles, especially tanks, also clatter onto the battlefield to take on pesky infantry and, of course, each other. M4A1 Shermans, M5A1 Stuarts, Fireflies, and Cromwells square off against Panzer IIIs and IVs as well as the big cats: Panthers and Tigers.&#10;&#10;Heroes of Normandy has 30 scenarios and tell the battles of the men from the 101st Airborne, 82nd Airborne, British 6th Airborne, 17th SS Panzergrenadier, 6th Fallschirmjager, 91st Airlanding, and 352nd Infantry Divisions.  The scenarios cover battles spanning the D-Day drops, fighting the Norman hedgerows, and Operation Market Garden.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s squad-level tactical combat at its most exciting!&#10;&#10;UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

    "Description": "Dungeon of Mandom VIII is a press-your-luck dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters. Players can win the game by winning two rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing two rounds.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. Each round, the player sets up the base character &mdash; one of eight heroes in the box &mdash; and all the equipment this character has. This one character represents every player being a fully-equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;The start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn. If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and remove a piece of equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment currently on the character.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allows you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round; if not, they lose. The players then reshuffle all the cards to make a new monster deck and use the same or a different hero to start the boasting once again.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last person standing.&#10;&#10;Dungeon of Mandom VIII includes the material in the original Dungeon of Mandom as well as seven new heroes, seven new monsters, and forty new pieces of equipment, with those items having previously appeared in Welcome to the Dungeon and Welcome Back to the Dungeon.&#10;&#10;",

Each faction involves a different gaming mechanism, and each combination of factions brings a different gaming experience.&#10;&#10;In Smash Up: Disney Edition, players choose two decks of fan-favorite Disney factions and combine their powers to take over bases, earn the most points, and win! Choose two from Frozen, Big Hero 6, Wreck-It Ralph, The Lion King, Mulan, Aladdin, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Beauty &amp; the Beast to create the most exciting team-ups imaginable!&#10;&#10;During the game, base cards &mdash; each with their own difficulties and abilities &mdash; are at stake. By playing cards from your hand, you try to have the most powerful set of minions on a base when the base is broken. When this happens, the three most powerful players on that base score points. When a player has 15 or more points at the end of a turn, they win. If two or more players have more than 15 VP, the one with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

This is a two-player game (although teams or even solitaire play would be just fine): one player assumes the role of the Axis (Germany and its allies) and the other player assumes the role of the Soviets (i.e., the Soviet Union).&#10;&#10;The individual ground units represent Divisions of 10-15,000 soldiers, Corps (from the Latin word &quot;Corpus,&quot; meaning body) of approximately 25-50,000 soldiers, or Armies of approximately 75,000 or more men. The Soviet ground units are mostly armies of approximately 40,000 men each, with a few cavalry and airborne corps of about 10,000 men each.&#10;&#10;Air units represent about 200 combat aircraft early in the war, and gradually more as the war progresses. Each hex on the map represents 30 miles of actual terrain from side to side, and each Game Turn represents the passage of 7.5 days (or up to 15 days during inclement weather).&#10;&#10;",

While you wield the power of the split, everyone else gets to choose first, leaving you with the remaining pile.&#10;&#10;Skyward is played over several rounds. Each round starts with The Split, followed by individual player turns. The goal of the game is to launch a combination of buildings that yield the most Victory Points. The end game is triggered when any player launches their 6th building or the central deck is emptied. Complete the current round as you would normally, then complete one final split.

Collect bodies, crystal skulls, and runes, then bring the dead back to life. This might sound simple enough, but triggering the actions in just the right order requires careful planning to make sure you aren't helping your competitors more than yourself.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Two street tiles may be swapped if the &quot;construction&quot; space is used and a player may hold several customer cards for maximum efficiency. The end game is triggered once a player has completed 5 customer cards and the bus driver with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Number 8 in the Pack O Game series.&#10;&#10;",

For you and your coworkers, it&rsquo;s as good as job as any, and if you time things just right you may even get a nice bonus at the end of the day. And since you have a time machine, you can take multiple cracks at it&hellip; assuming things don&rsquo;t get too chaotic with your past selves running around.&#10;&#10;Loop Inc. is played over the course of three days, with each day actually being the same day, but a different time through it. During the first day, players will get to perform three actions and send out their one time machine. Actions include gathering components, setting up advertising, and more. Then, at the end of the day, players jump into their time machines and return to the beginning to start the day over again. The catch is, when players go back in time to try the day again, their past selves are still running around. This means they&rsquo;ll have to perform all the actions from the previous version of the day, as well as three new ones. They&rsquo;ll also have an additional ship to launch. On the third try, things compound even further...making timing key. At the end of the third day, the player who completed the most profitable trips wins, provided they didn&rsquo;t cause too many tears in the space time continuum.&#10;&#10;",

Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.  Landing on another player's ball lets you capture it, but if your ball lands off the board, it's out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Who do you trust? If you sit on the Iron Throne, the wisest answer is &quot;no one&quot;.&#10;&#10;Game of Thrones: Oathbreaker is a game of deception and social deduction. One player assumes the role of King (or Queen), while the others represent the great Lords and Ladies of the Houses of Westeros. Some are loyalists who want order in the realm, others are conspirators who seek to undermine the throne, and all of them have a secret agenda of their own. Who is truly loyal, and who is simply hungry for power, honor, and coin? It's up to the King to figure it out before it's too late.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts seven rounds. In each round, players reveal a number of mission cards, each of which has an associated influence type: crowns, ravens, or swords. Each noble plays influence cards face down to one or more missions and places their House Sigil at the mission where they played the most cards. Then each mission is resolved by shuffling the influence cards there and tallying up successes and failures. If a mission succeeds, Order is generated; otherwise Chaos is generated. Nobles earn rewards (coin, honor, power) based on whether the mission with their House Sigil succeeded or failed.&#10;&#10;The King can play decree cards during the game to grant favor to nobles who seem loyal, or cast suspicion on suspected conspirators. Decree cards award Order if the King was correct and Chaos if the King was wrong.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, if Order exceeds Chaos, the King wins and any loyalists who achieved their personal ambitions win. If Chaos has the edge, then any conspirators who achieved their personal ambitions win.&#10;&#10;",

Brian Marrs did all the programming for the computer game.&#10;&#10;Down In Flames places each player in the cockpit of a Leader and Wingman as they enter combat against other aircraft. By playing cards, you gain advantageous positions on your targets, fire your guns, and send them down in flames!&#10;&#10;The game is based on a unique action-reaction card mechanic. Each card can be countered by specific other cards. At the bottom of every card is the list of cards it is allowed to cancel. This makes for exciting card play back and forth between players&hellip;&#10;&#10;Player #1: &ldquo;I Play an In My Sights for 3 Hits. If you don&rsquo;t stop it, you&rsquo;re going down.&rdquo; Player #2: &ldquo;I counter with a Barrel Roll.&rdquo; Player #1: &ldquo;I react with a Yo-Yo.&rdquo; Player #2: &ldquo;You got me.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Each aircraft is accurately simulated with a several ratings including: Performance (the maximum cards you can hold), Horsepower (the maximum cards you can draw each turn), Bursts (how many times you can fire), Damage (how much damage your attacks inflict), and Airframe (how much damage your aircraft can sustain).&#10;&#10;The air combat is simulated using a Positioning system that allows aircraft to be Advantaged, Tailing, Disadvantaged, or Tailed in relation to other aircraft. An aircraft&rsquo;s position determine if it can aircraft, and how many bonus Bursts it receives if it is Advantaged or Tailing.&#10;&#10;The game uses a simple Altitude system to add this vital aspect of air combat. Aircraft get to draw cards when diving, and must discard cards when climbing.&#10;&#10;The game also includes Light, Medium, and Heavy Bombers that are used in the historical campaign games.&#10;&#10;Down In Flames has won several awards through the years and continues to be a favorite for both serious and casual gamers.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    110 Full color Action Cards&#10;    110 Full Color Aircraft Cards&#10;    Full Color Rulebook&#10;    Full Color Counter Sheet (88 - 5/8&rdquo; counters)&#10;    6 Full Color Campaign Sheets&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the Publisher's Website)&#10;&#10;",

The game focuses on cavalry and archery action, featuring mounted archers of exceptional skill. Devil's Horsemen depicts the four major battles of the era - The Indus, The Kalka, Liegnitz and Ayn Jalut.&#10;&#10;Devil's Horsemen features basic rules for both regular and SimpleGBoH play. The rules bring the system into full flower of mounted archery, with a detailed, augmented set of archery and cavalry mechanics that include various types of Shower Fire (as opposed to plain Volley Fire), Impetuosity and Aggression, Feigned Retreat, Harass and Disperse tactics, and Rally to Standards, with the various armies and units being rated for their ability to use these.&#10;&#10;Devil's Horsemen presens a truly colorful array of armies for you to lead into battle: there are 10 full tumen (divisions) of Mongols, plus Polovtsians, Galicians, Chernigovians, Kievans, Persian Khwarazmians, Poles, Silesians, Bohemians, the great Teutonic Knights, and the first army to ever significantly defeat the Mongols, The Mamluks.&#10;&#10;These mighty armies show up in four great battles of the period (ranging from battles needing 1/2 mapsheet to two full-mapsheets).&#10;&#10;The Indus (Genghis Khan vs. Shah Jalal ad-Din and the Khwarazmian Persians, 1221). One mapsheet in size, this is the battle that gave The Mongols control over all of Central Asia.&#10;     &#10;The Kalka (Prince Subudei vs. the combined Armies of Rus, 1223). Two mapsheets in size, this battle includes two massive (and very nattily dressed) armies, with the Rus suffering under fractured command, and the Mongols giving us a foretaste of the famous Zulu horns of the buffalo tactics.&#10;     &#10;Liegnitz (Prices Baidan and Kaidan vs. Henry the Pious and an army of Eastern Europeans, 1241). A 1/2 mapsheet battle which introduced Europe to the Mongols, and from which we get the famous Christian prayer of the era, From the Fury of the Tartars, oh Lord, Deliver Us. But you do get to use the best European heavy cavalry of the day, the Teutonic knights, under fearsome commander, Poppo.&#10;     &#10;Ayn Jalut (Prince Ketbugha vs. The Mamluks, 1260). A 1/2 mapsheet battle that saw the first real defeat of a Mongol Army, this time by the new Middle East Muslim power, the Mamluks. Granted, this was a second-rate, rear-guard group of Mongols, but the Mamluks showed they were a new force to reckon with.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;979 full-color counters&#10;Two full-color double-sided 22x34&quot; mapsheets&#10;Rules Book&#10;Scenario Book&#10;One Player Aid Card&#10;One 10-sided die&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS: Mark Herman and Richard Berg&#10;ART DIRECTOR/PACKAGE DESIGN: Rodger B.

The other team controls the demons, who seek to break the seal to the underworld before morning. &nbsp;&#10;&#10;During the game, you choose a unique knight or demon, each with a variety of special powers&mdash;such as the Flame Knight&rsquo;s ability to surround his foes in fire, or the Bone Crusher&rsquo;s power to summon skeletal minions. The cards you play from your hand to perform actions can each be used in different ways, and a set of unique location tiles allows you to create the monastery with a different layout every game.&#10;&#10;Knight Fall also features a campaign mode for one to two players. In this mode, you read stories while exploring the map of a haunted valley, drawing your path as you travel. Wander through crumbling churches, a sinister forest, and a dark mountain to stop the demons before the final battle at Thornmar Abbey. You must do whatever you can to keep your Knights alive; the death of each knight means one fewer hero to combat the invading demons in the final battle!&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Refresh of classic Clue/Cluedo game. Significant change: Adds a new character, Dr. Orchid. Also includes two-player rules.&#10;&#10;Clue/do is a murder mystery game. The aim is to find out who committed the murder, which weapon they used, and where in the mansion they did it. How do you solve the case? By careful questioning of your fellow players you can deduce which information is concealed in the crime envelope. The trick is to be clever with your questioning... Everyone develops their own system! &#10; This version of the game plays faster than older versions of Clue, with the help of bigger spaces on the board, special Red Cards, and a new layout of the mansion so you can walk between rooms. The bedroom has an ensuite, and you can wander from the kitchen straight into the dining room.&#10;&#10;All new artwork brings this classic murder mystery to life, with a high level of detail.&#10;&#10;It also comes with cool red dice!&#10;&#10;Note: In this version of Clue, when playing with the 2-player/Team rules: before you deal the black Clue cards to the players, you take the top four black CLUE cards from the deck and place them face down in a row at the side of the board. When the other player/team cannot answer your question, you get to secretly look at one of the four cards at the side of the board.&#10;&#10;You also don't use the Red Bonus cards in a 2-player/Team game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.&#10;&#10;Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Smolensk: Barbarossa Derailed is the latest release in the Operational Combat Series (OCS), covering the campaign along the Moscow highway in the summer of 1941. These actions set the stage for the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s autumn drive on the Soviet capital, and many historians believe the bitter fighting here ultimately doomed the Axis to failure in Russia.&#10;&#10;The game begins on 8 July with Barbarossa still in high gear. In August, the advance stalls as Hitler diverts most of the panzers from the map to forces around Leningrad and Kiev. Soviet counteroffensives will push Army Group Center close to the breaking point by game&rsquo;s end on 8 September. The asymmetry of the two armies will be familiar to veterans of past OCS campaigns, especially Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg II. There is the expected qualitative difference in typical Action Ratings, along with stark contrasts in logistical capabilities and replacement rates. There also some unique twists in the situation, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Three of the panzer divisions are getting their first taste of combat, so their Action Ratings are reduced.&#10;     The rivalry between Heinz Guderian and Hermann Hoth makes it difficult for these generals to coordinate their panzer armies, and might prevent the ring from closing around Smolensk.&#10;     Soviet tank divisions are shown for the first time. They pack a wallop, but their quality leaves a lot to be desired.&#10;     The Soviet 1st Motorized Division is presented as a somewhat elite multi-unit formation that includes some heavy KV-1s and T-34s.&#10;     The contributions of small militia, tank, and anti-tank units are reflected by the Soviet Alarm Pool.&#10;     Other chrome accounts for &lsquo;tree bark soup&rsquo; (used by cut-off units), planes diverted to terror-bomb Moscow, and special markers for artillery ammo &amp; katyusha effects.&#10;&#10;&#10;Smolensk is a small and fairly simple entry in the series, with special rules kept to a minimum. We think players will enjoy the fact both sides must attack and defend. By the end they will learn three things about this campaign: the Soviets are more than just punching bags, the Germans are challenged to hold their early gains,&#10;and the road to Moscow will be paved in blood.&#10;&#10;Seven scenarios are included:&#10;Intro Scenario: Vitebsk, 1/2 turn, using about 1/4 of the map&#10;Smolensk Campaign, 8 July to 8 September (19 turns)&#10;Late July Start, 22 July to 8 September (15 turns)&#10;1st Counteroffensive, 22 July to 1 August (4 turns)&#10;Early August Start, 8 August to 8 September (10 turns)&#10;2nd Counteroffensive, 8 August to 22 August (5 turns)&#10;3rd Counteroffensive, 26 August to 8 September (5 turns)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of Avalon Hill&#039;s family games that appeals to gamers as well.  Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!&#10;&#10;&#10;This Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.&#10;&#10;Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.&#10;&#10;Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.&#10;&#10;Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.&#10;&#10;Finally- The game has excellent style.  The dinosaur areas are displayed in a unique &ldquo;comic book&rdquo; format, allowing for great enjoyment and immersion from all players regardless of age.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kingmaker: The Royal Re-Launch depicts the period of English history in the 15th century that became known as the Wars of the Roses. It is based on the premise that the powerful noble families used the Lancastrian and Yorkist royalty as pawns in a greater game for the control of the kingdom. Players manoeuvre Noble pieces representing the leaders of 24 major families in England and Wales, in order to gain control over a Royal piece of their own, while also eliminating rival Royal pieces and weakening their opponents. It is a game of political and military action, and the ability to react to unforeseen events. You win by a combination of military, political, and diplomatic skills.&#10;&#10;There are four games in Kingmaker: The Royal Re-Launch:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The new Kingmaker II for 2 to 5 players, for those who prefer a shorter game with a greater variety of win conditions, including prestige gained through domination of the government, cities, and the church.&#10;     The original Classic Kingmaker for 2 to 6 players, where the only path to victory is through controlling the last crowned Royal piece.&#10;     Extended Classic Kingmaker with extra Crown and Event cards along with additional optional rules for Parliament and battles, in which dice can be used to determine whether Nobles and Royal pieces live or die.&#10;     The Solo Challenge, for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;&#10;As a player, you control a Faction consisting of one or more Nobles. Each Noble piece you play on the board has a corresponding Noble card which you display in your Faction space on the table. You can strengthen your Nobles with Titles, Offices and other cards, such as Bishops, Mercenaries, and Ships.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of your turn, you draw a card from the Event deck, and all players follow its instructions. During your turn, you may move your Noble pieces, fight battles, and conduct sieges. You may also have the opportunity to call Parliament to gain the benefit of additional Titles and Offices, and perhaps the chance to crown a new King. At the end of your turn, you draw from the Crown deck, which may enable you to add a new Noble to your Faction or increase the power of a Noble already in play.&#10;&#10;",

The leader shuffles placed cards and puts them in row, face up.&#10;&#10;Players must guess which card the leader has in mind. Each player chooses a token with the number correlating to his guess-version, then places It number-down on the table. When all players have made their decisions, they turn over the tokens.&#10;&#10;- If all players have guessed the leader&rsquo;s card correctly, then his elephant retreats three steps back. The elephants of the players stand in place.&#10;- If none of the players managed to guess the leader&rsquo;s card correctly, then his elephant retreats two steps back. Other players move their elephants forward on as many steps as the number of people who chose the same card.&#10;- In all other cases, the leader&rsquo;s elephant and the elephants of those players, who guessed his card correctly, move up three steps. Moreover, all players, including the leader, move their elephant forward as many steps, as the number of people who chose the same card as them.&#10;&#10;In the end of each turn all played cards should be discarded, and each player gets one card from the deck. Next player in the clockwise direction becomes the leader. The game ends when all the cards in the players&rsquo; hands are played.

The name of the brand doesn&rsquo;t have to be mentioned &ndash; the association may be made with its slogan, campaign, etc.&#10;- (TV) &ndash; Association must be related to movies, cartoons, TV series or TV programs.&#10;- (book) &ndash; Association should be presented in the form of a story.&#10;&#10;",

Goals can keep changing, though, so you never know for sure how to win.&#10;&#10;With Adventure Time Fluxx, you get to join Jake the dog and Finn the human for some ever-changing fun.

No whisky was even involved. Some parts of your body have been enlarged &ndash; and some shrunk. Shoes are going to be expensive for sometime. The less said about your nose, the better. It is now time to take matters into your own (now quite large) hands.&#10;&#10;The Spell de Spiel is hidden in spellbooks scattered throughout the land. Find the books and cast the spell, and you can banish the witch and return to your normal size. However, watch out! The witch is powerful. Maybe the good creatures of the land will come to your aid. Centaurs may gallop, dragons may fly, and even the crusty old librarian could research some dusty tomes. Vampires, for once, are keen to get their teeth into the action. Even the truculent dwarves might arrive in time to help (with their small-man syndrome axes). You need to act now. The witch grows ever stronger. Skeletons and goblin spider-riders are not traditionally known for their sense of humor. Can you recover the spellbooks, defeat the Witch and her allies, and have bards sing your praises for evermore?&#10;&#10;It is a time for justice, a time for change, a time for heroes. With big feet. And big noses.

    "Description": "In &quot;Star Trek: The Adventure Game&quot;, you send forth a starship, exploring unknown planets across the immense distances of space.  One player represents the mighty United Federation of Planets; the other, the powerful and mysterious Klingon Empire.  Solo play is also possible.&#10;&#10;With outright war between the two interstellar powers forbidden by the Organian Treaty, both are constantly striving to increase their prestige and size.  This is done by discovering, exploring and then persuading - or forcing - new worlds to join your federation or empire.&#10;&#10;Play is simple, but successful exploration does not come easily.  Upon reaching a planet, you choose a course of action, and learn from a special booklet how the planet and its inhabitants react to you.  You might conquer a new world - or you could lose a starship.&#10;&#10;Includes full color 22&quot;x17&quot; mounted map, 40 colorful 1&quot; planets, 64 5/8 playing pieces, short rules booklet, 40 planet adventure booklet, three status display cards, and two six sided dice.&#10;&#10;",

You're a Roman statesman struggling to survive in this era of cultural decline and political chaos. While foreign invaders and domestic incompetents devour the last resources of the Empire, you'll try to build your career out of the rubble. You start in Rome, and the Visigoth starts on the outskirts of a spiral board. Each turn, you play and purchase cards that produce resources and give you special effects, as well as allowing you to move further out from the doomed Eternal City. Then the Visigoth moves toward Rome, destroying your cards... unless you spend your precious resources to bribe him. When the Visigoth reaches Rome, or a player reaches the outskirts of the empire, the game is over and the player who has fled the furthest from Rome wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Over seventy years later, and the divisions still run deeper than the straits which separate the Republic of China (the ROC) from the People's Republic of China (the PRC). Times have changed greatly since the PRC failed to conquer the island of Taiwan from the nationalists' Republic of China at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and the states that were even then separated by politics and economics have grown further apart as both sides now hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their bitter division once and for all.&#10;&#10;Next War: Taiwan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and the follow-on to Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war in and around the island of Taiwan. In this sequel, the communist leadership of the PRC have decided that its time to end its rhetoric and posturing and bring the long-lost democratically governed ROC island into the fold of the Socialist Harmonious Society.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of the &quot;terrain&quot; surrounding Taiwan, the game features an expanded, yet still abstracted and playable, naval system including submarine threats, ASW, mine warfare, and anti-naval strikes. In addition, rules exist for combining Next War: Taiwan with Next War: Korea to simulate an expanded conflict.&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ownership of Next War: Korea will NOT be required to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;UnitsGround units in Next War: Taiwan represent primarily brigades, regiments, and battalions of the armies of the PRC and ROC and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side. Changes to the naval system include&#10;&#10;     Naval Display Play Aid to allow for movement, air ranges, etc. in the seas surrounding Taiwan&#10;     a Submarine Threat Level and ASW Level matrix for the PRC and Allies respectively to represent the subsurface conflict&#10;     naval mine warfare allowing either side to attempt to deny usage of Beaches for Amphibious Assaults or Ports and Beachheads for Sea Transport&#10;     anti-Naval Strikes (including Cruise Missiles) allowing each side to force enemy Naval units to withdraw or risk losses&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and TerrainThe game's map presents the island of modern-day Taiwan at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map covers the entire island and includes several holding boxes and tracking displays.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game SystemA game turn is generally composed of:&#10;&#10;Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.&#10;&#10;Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.&#10;&#10;Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines.&#10;&#10;Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes.&#10;&#10;One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns&#10;&#10;Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements&#10;Victory Determination&#10;&#10;Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ScenariosThere are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three are small and cover the first weeks of the war by dividing the island into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults by the PRC to establish beachheads and take Ports and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire Campaign Game which uses the entire map and all of the Standard Game rules. One other scenario is provided which examines a theoretical U.S. Amphibious landing in an attempt to take back the island.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.&#10;&#10;There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan &#226;&#128;&#147; The Fifth Arab-Israeli War to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Chinese players in the region.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a full set of rules covering how to play a combined Next War: Taiwan/Korea game.&#10;&#10;In Next War: Taiwan, the Taiwan Straits are on fire with the Goliath of the PRC arrayed against the David of the ROC. Can you, as the People's Liberation Army/Naval commander, conquer the long separated island in four weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of China's Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will happen in Korea while all this is going on? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out...&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Components&#10;     1 22x34&quot; map&#10;     1 11x17&quot; Naval Display&#10;     3 9/16&quot; counter sheets&#10;     2 rulebooks (Standard + Advanced Rules and Game Specific Rules) &#10;     6 8.5x11&quot; Player Aids &#10;     2 11x17&quot; Player Aids &#10;     1 10-sided die &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Design and Development: Mitchell Land&#10;Original System Design: Gene Billingsley&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE 3.5 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE 7.5 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE Brigade / Regiment / Battalion&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS One or two (can be played in teams)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Colonizing is hard work! Relax with a rousing round of golf on the Mars back-nine! Can you land your specially-engineered golf ball between the rocky hazards on the wind-swept Martian plateau? Can you drive over treacherous terrain and sink your shot in fewer flicks than your opponents? You'll be surprised how much golf on Mars plays like the classic Earth game, and with dozens of hole arrangements there is no shortage of exciting new challenges. Suit up, grab your clubs, and flick for a crater-hole-in-one!&#10;&#10;Mars Open: Tabletop Golf is a dexterity golf game. On your turn, flick your golf ball card over obstacles and toward the crater hole box. Your goal is to land your ball in the box in as few strokes as possible. After all players have finished the hole, reassemble the obstacles into the next hole and tee off again. The winner is the player with the lowest score after nine (or eighteen) holes.&#10;&#10;",
