The shift to a set 8x4 board caused the game to be viewed differently than on the circular board of Stonehenge.&#10;&#10;Another unique aspect to J is that players can LOSE the game if they form a certain type of connection, which would be a misere condition in a connection game.  This is also a a unique feature.  I had been pondering how to do one and J provides the opportunity to do this.&#10;&#10;The game also features several other uncommon features, besides the small board and misere game ending condition, like piece recycling, and also entire lines of pieces being pushed.&#10;&#10;",

In each round, one player is the explainer, while the other players try to guess the concept. The explainer receives a set of 24 blocks (consisting of 11 brown blocks and 13 blocks of other colours). He is also given a card which tells him the concept that he has to explain using the blocks. He may not talk or make sounds, though he may move the blocks. He can also give a hint by placing one of his non-brown blocks in one of the circles on the board that show different categories.&#10;&#10;If one of the other players successfully guesses the concept, he gets the card and the block used to give a hint (if any). Then, all non-brown blocks are placed aside, and the explainer receives a new card, and continues to explain the new concept with the remaining blocks. This continues until the time runs out, after which the results are scored. The explainer receives points for each concept he has explained, and each other player receives points for each concept he has guessed. Each concept is worth 1 to 4 points, depending on the amount of non-brown blocks that have been set aside. The more blocks that have been used during the round, the higher the value of the concepts.&#10;&#10;Now, a new round begins, and the next player becomes the explainer. The game ends after each player has been the explainer thrice; the player who has gathered the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Dice are used as balls in the game. The bowler gently pitches a die (with faces 1, 2, 4, 6, out and NR (for no runs) to the batsman, preferably without the die touching the table. The batsman tries to hit it. If he misses and the stumps are hit, the batsman is out bowled. If he hits the die and it is caught by the bowler, the player is out caught. Otherwise, if he hits it, the result of the shot is shown by the top face of the die.&#10;&#10;",

He started out with a hundred credits to his name and the keys to a small cargo hauler.  Over the years he forged intergalactic trade routes, stared down pirates and amassed a small fortune.&#10;&#10;When Willy died he left behind a sizeable fortune and a single stipulation in his will, that one of his relatives would prove to be the rightful heir to his shipping empire by following in his footsteps.  Relatives started pouring out of the woodwork trying for a chance to win Willy's fortune.  You know nothing about trade routes, or pirates, or the galaxy at large... but this is a chance of a lifetime.  As one of Willy's recognized relatives (fourth cousin of a nephew, twice removed) the lawyers for the Slowman estate are going to provide you with 100 credits and a small cargo hauler, if you can be the first to amass 1000 credits you will prove yourself to be the rightful heir.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: In this game the players race around the board to pick-up and deliver chits to amass their fortunes.  The board is modular in order to increase replayability, and the chits are not sorted to decrease the set-up time (chits only have to be added/removed when changing the starting worlds - not the board layout).  Chits include Events which have a timed effect, Goods, Passengers, Enemies which can harass the players or be hunted for bounty, Mined Goods and Ship Upgrades (increase your combat effectiveness or speed).  This allows for a variety of gameplay strategies.  The rules have been streamlined and every effort has been made to make it as streamlined and simple as possible without losing any of the flavor or depth.&#10;&#10;But in the end the game is all about making money, and the first player to 1000 credits is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It is a calendar of the Ages that describes how the progression of Heavens and Underworlds condition the human consciousness, and thus the frames for our thought and actions within a given Age.&#10;&#10;To some people it is predicting the end of the world, December 2012. For others, the Calendar is forecasting the start of a new Era. This game incorporates both views.&#10;&#10;The object of this game is to create a physical vehicle like a pyramid to focus and spread universal spiritual power. For this task we will need builders, materials, equipment and money. We must work together to build 11 Spiritual Centers around the Planet to ward off the many Destructive Perils entering from many directions. How much of the Earth did we allow to be destroyed? How much new spiritual consciousness did we bring into being?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "48 cards with different values on them, from a halfpenny to eight old pence. Probably aimed at parents who wanted to buy an educational game for their children. Cards are revealed around the table and if the exposed cards total a shilling (12 old pence) or more then the first to shout that observation, wins. Very good to get children used to money and also good for their mental arithmetic calculations.&#10; This game is as entertaining and exciting as it is simple.&#10;The cards are dealt in the usual manner and played in rotation in front of the players without being seen until played. When any of the cards &mdash; not necessarily all of them &mdash; that are lying on the top &mdash; make up one shilling exactly, the player who first calls &quot; Shilling &rdquo; takes such cards, together with any that may be beneath them. The game finally rests with two players, and is won by the holder of all the cards above threepence ha'penny. An additional interest is added if a forfeit is given in the event of a player calling &ldquo; Shilling &rdquo; by mistake.&#10;&#10;",

If you land on one of the squares in the path with an arrow pointing at the animal cards, you may pick one up and put it on your Sand Pail Card. You may get more than one of the same animal cards.

Goods may be delivered from east to west (and vice versa) only through holes in the wall by removing the red track markers. Red cubes represent the Soviet Army and Blue cubes the American, British and French forces; movement of these cubes is restricted until the round marker reaches the red player marker that was placed at the start of the game.

Both players must agree on the grid size before the game starts.&#10;&#10;There are 2 phases on the game:&#10;&#10;1- Negotiation phase&#10;&#10;A random player starts by telling a number. Then the other player must tell a higher one or pass. The process is repeated until one of the players passes.&#10;&#10;The player that 'passed' is called 'LOW', and the other player is called 'HIGH'. Write down the last number reached during the negotiation. This number is the called 'LIMIT'.&#10;&#10;Example:&#10;&#10;A: 70&#10;B: 120&#10;A: 143&#10;B: Passes&#10;&#10;A is 'HIGH', B is 'LOW' and LIMIT = 143&#10;&#10;2- Playing phase&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each game lasts a number of turns equal to (m+n)/3 rounded up. A turn is considered a player's move (not 2 players).&#10;&#10;Starting with 'HIGH' players take alternate turns removing an entire row or column of cells from the grid, by drawing a line on it. The line must go through at least one square which doesn't already have a line. It is forbidden to draw a line so that it leaves the board with no 'unremoved' cells remaining.&#10;&#10;When all the turns have been played, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;Several rectangular groups of 'unremoved' cells have been created. Multiply the size of all the groups to calculate the score.&#10;&#10;Example:&#10;&#10;The following groups have been created: 1,1,2,2,3,6. Score= 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 6 = 72&#10;&#10;If the final score is higher than LIMIT, the 'HIGH' player wins. Otherwise, 'LOW' wins.&#10;&#10;Designer notes&#10;&#10;TAU was evolved from OMEGA while teaching my students how to multiply in binary base. It uses Linkage's fewer/more idea. I recommend starting with boards of m+n = 20..30. Trivial sizes might be interesting only from a mathematical point of view. I recommend the shortest side to be at least 1/3rd of the longest one. Squared boards are particularly interesting.&#10;&#10;Thank you, Russ Williams and Nathan Morse for the corrections.&#10;&#10;",

If they're the only pirate to choose that island then they will take the treasure, but if two or more pirates had the same idea then the treasure will go unclaimed! The smartest pirates will know when to bluff, when to take the lesser sapphires and when the time is right to make for the all-important gold!&#10;&#10;Landlubbers is a great warm-up game, children's party game or a chance for kids to &quot;get one over&quot; their scurvy parents. YARRRRRRRRR!&#10;&#10;",
