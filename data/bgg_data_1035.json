    "Description": "Oops! The robber escaped into the town! The knights start seeking clues from the people of the town. Fortunately, the knights have got a lot of information. But it&rsquo;s not complete and the knights are not satisfied. Now they try to grab more clues from each other!&#10;&#10;The players have cards in their hands as clues on the robbery. Then, the players sort their hand cards into an ascending order. Now, the turn player plays one card face-up to another player, seeking an answer. If that player has the same card at the end of their hand, they must give it to the turn player along with the played card. So, the players start to detect the other hand cards from seeking clues.&#10;&#10;If you have 2 or 3 players, it&rsquo;s a competition to win.&#10;If you have 4 players, it&rsquo;s a two partnership game to win.&#10;If you have 5 players, one player is solo, and the other four are two partnerships.&#10;&#10;",

Alfred must have assumed that the West Saxons could once again to look forward to a prolonged period of peace. But within five months Guthrum had reinforced his army and on the twelfth night, while the Saxons celebrated there holy period, Guthrum and his Viking Allies launched a surprise attack at Alfred's Royal estate at Cippanhamm. Through good intelligence, good fortitude and/or plain good luck Alfred was able to escape and with a handful of followers made his way to the marshes of the Somerset Levels.&#10;It is here in the most inhospitable of conditions of sea-flooded swamp that Alfred, with a handful of followers, was to make a seemingly impregnable fortress at Althelney. It was from that King Alfred was to launch a guerilla campaign against his Viking tormentors. Within five months the King's forces defeated the Viking Army of Guthrum in a pitched battle at Ethandun.&#10;Though Alfred entered the marsh with a small number of loyal followers we also know that he was not completely without allies. Odda Ealdorman of Devonshire was protecting Athelney by controlling the River Perret from Cynuit Hillfort, and was to do battle there with the legendary Ubbe Lothbrok (son of Ragnar) Alfred also had the support of Ealdorman of Somerset, Aethelnoth, who had also been fighting the Vikings from the Somerset levels. Aethelnoth's support was in no doubt instrumental in helping Alfred regroup and plan his campaign to reclaim Wessex.&#10;Not all of Alfred's Earls were as loyal as Odda and Aethelnoth, and in this game the Saxons of Wiltshire are in a state of civil war with their warriors split between loyalty for their King and a Saxon controlled Wessex. It is there that the treacherous Ealdorman, Wulfhere, gained control and sided with the Viking invaders.&#10;The Viking strength was in their professional and aggressive soldiery skills. Their weaknesses were often in the re-supply of fighting men and the fact the West Saxons were fighting for their home.&#10;Kings are of great importance in this series of games. When they are leading the warriors in combat your moral and thereby fighting ability is increased, without them weakened. Of course the loss of a King in battle can also mean the loss of your cause. However, in this era risks must be taken to take and hold the crown.&#10;Sharpen your sword and pick up your shield for the call has gone out, 'the King is on the march'&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player will spend their resources to play creatures to attack their opponents with and defend their Base (their side of the field), and play powerful spells, weapons, and artifacts to power up their creatures! Be careful though, because you might trigger an opponents Event card! (It's like an instant or a trap card) and then you might get set back as a result! Plan carefully as you set up your Terrain cards (Their like lands and field cards) to bolster your creatures defenses (by giving them a safe place to hide) and be prepared when you play your Epics (similar to legendary artifacts) because though they may greatly aid your creatures, one slip up and it could be stolen from you, if that happens 3 times you lose the game! Oh and don't forget to pay attention to the placement of your creatures to (because it matters big time!) If your not careful you might leave your weakest creature on the Front Lines (where it can be attacked) when it should have stayed in your Base (where its more safe)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The player who scores less points will be the winner.&#10;&#10;                                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                &#10;                                                                            &#10;                                                                        &#10;                                                                    &#10;                                                                &#10;                                                            &#10;                                                        &#10;                                                    &#10;                                                &#10;                                            &#10;                                        &#10;                                    &#10;                                &#10;                            &#10;                        &#10;                    &#10;                &#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Juega un partido de golf con 5 dados&#10;Con toda la emoci&oacute;n de un partido de golf.

During their go, each player must decide how to distribute the different monsters that are dealt, among the players. They must place the cards, forming a steady row without any of them falling.

    "Description": "This hidden set-up war game is an unusual WWII adaptation of the classic L'Attaque. What makes it most unusual is that the rules are dated 11/44, which means it must have been one of the first French games published after the liberation.&#10;&#10;This is a more complex game than L'Attaque or its successor Stratego. Its name translates as &quot;The Lightning War&quot; (or Blitzkrieg), and this is reflected in the mix of pieces.&#10;&#10;Whereas L'Attaque and its successor Stratego simply used numerically ranked pieces, this game includes a host of WWII-era innovations as well, with pieces representing parachutists, bombers, anti-aircraft guns, delayed-action bombs, flying bombs and a tanker-truck that must survive to keep the bombers flying. Missing from the mix is any kind of armored unit, but there are &quot;magnetic fences&quot; that somehow disable the engines of aeroplanes.&#10;&#10;Movement and combat is much more flexible than in the basic L'Attaque. Pieces may move in any direction, including diagonally, and may attack any piece orthogonally adjacent. To win, players must capture both the opponent's flag and its &quot;secret plan&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gank is what a MOBA video game looks like when you convert it for the tabletop with euro-design. You don't push around a hundred miniatures on a map with a hundred grid spaces. You don't see dozens of trooper miniatures scattered across the battlefield on the various lanes.&#10;&#10;What you do see, are still the iconic 3 lanes that each leads to both your base and your opponent's. But these are very simplified and there are only 7 spaces on each of these lanes, which really act more as tracks. There are no actual soldier miniatures, but there is a frontline marker that represents the point at which each lane is being contested.&#10;&#10;It is deceptively simple! You just play down 1 of 5 Heroes (each hero taking unique roles - Carry, DPS, Utility, Tank, Support) from your hand, pick action cards from a pyramid that represent what the hero does that turn, and finally cast skills and spells from that hero. It is then your opponent's turn. Rinse and repeat until either one of the lanes has all towers destroyed and gets overrun by the opposing side, or one of the teams' morale drops to zero from having too many hero deaths, or a team manages to collect all Celestium crystals first and win immediately.&#10;&#10;To ensure this is the RIGHT game for you, do not go into it thinking that it is that simple or that it's a casual gateway game. Gank is intended for gamers who are already in the hobby for some time. This is a pretty HEAVY game in every sense of the word, and you have to watch for multiple things like which action cards NOT to take so the opponent does not have options opened up for them, what cards to deny them by picking those yourself (even if you don't really need them) and even looking for big combos between heroes!&#10;&#10;As for Hero miniatures, you have an option to make your game even more beautiful and get 3D representatives of your Heroes, or you can simply choose to use the more affordable alternative where Heroes are just cards in your hand. In the event you have the luxury of the premium miniatures, they are no mere decorations. You will use the miniatures heavily during the game as representatives of the Heroes being played out, their sequence and order etc.&#10;&#10;As mentioned earlier, the full action of the battle is represented by a pyramid-shaped layout of cards that you and your opponents take turns to pick cards from - starting from the bottom row. There are 4 types of cards, namely Farming, Attacking, Pushing and Treasure cards. Depending on the role of the Hero played forth, you will also pick cards with different rulesets. For example, the Tank can only take 1 card but does not take any damage from Farming cards (which others normally do). The Carry allows you to take 1 card, and then 1 more directly above it (this makes your Carry the most powerful role since it can access the higher tier cards faster) or the Utility Hero which takes any 2 cards in the same row, as long as they are different types. Sometimes on the cards, there are Celestium crystals to be collected, or materials to be farmed (usually from Farming cards) where you can later combine with Item Recipes to create powerful equipment for your Heroes. Gold and Mana are also acquired from these very action cards.&#10;&#10;Each Hero you play generally has 2 skills, one of which requires mana to perform. There is a 3rd 'Ultimate' skill that unlocks for them when they level up (there's only 2 levels in the game, so each Hero can only level up once)&#10;&#10;The game is played in Rounds, with each ending when the top card on the pyramid is taken. At the end of each round, there is a Planning phase. Players will spend their Gold to manipulate the battlefield. Because buying of strategy cards are secretive, players will inevitably experience exciting mind games. Will they buy card A?

    "Description": "In a far off world of Swords and Sorcery the cyclopean Tower of Ravingspire looms over a mystic battlefield. Mighty warriors of the realm, known as Reavers, sojourn to this desolate valley to battle for dominance in an annual combat known as the Reaverquest. These warriors must fight with all their skill and cunning, as the seeping magic of the Tower may alter the very battlefield they fight on at a moment&rsquo;s notice!&#10;&#10;Reaverquest is a fast-paced card battle game of brawling and swordplay set in the Sword and Sorcery world of Ravingspire. For 2-3 Players.&#10;&#10;Reaverquest consists of 30 Fight cards, 10 Rage cards, 9 Battlefield cards, and 3 Reaver Hero cards. Each Player chooses a specific Reaver to represent them in the combat, and uses that Hero card to track their health. Six of the ten Rage cards are randomly chosen and dealt into the deck of Fight cards, making the Rage dynamics of each game slightly different. The Battlefield cards are set aside as a separate deck near the gameplay area.&#10;&#10;Each Player is dealt a hand of six cards from a communal Fight deck that contains various values of Attack, Riposte, and Deflect cards, all with values ranging from 1-10. The deck also contains six of the ten Rage cards, which have various effects in battle. This hand is then used to combat your opponent, with the goal of reducing your opponent&rsquo;s health to zero. Health is known as Vigor, and is tracked by rotating your Hero card so your current value is facing you.&#10;&#10;Each time a Player plays an ATTACK card a new Battle begins, and their opponent may DEFLECT the damage (partially blocking the Attack or sending the excess damage toward another Player), RIPOSTE the damage (partially blocking the Attack or returning the excess damage back toward the Attacker), or they may use one of the rare RAGE cards that have various effects. Ripostes may be countered back and forth until one of the Reavers takes damage, at which time that Battle ends.&#10;&#10;Initiative for each Battle (including the decision of which Attack card to play and who to send it toward) goes to the Player who did not play the last card in the previous Battle. Sometimes it can be more advantageous to take damage from the current Battle rather than block it so as to claim Initiative for the next Battle!&#10;&#10;If a defender ever uses a DEFLECT card to cause the value of the Battle to equal exactly zero, then they have performed a Perfect Parry. This kind of combat prowess so near the otherworldly Tower of Ravingspire causes a dimensional shift in the Battlefield. That defender draws a Battlefield card and benefits from the Perfect Parry effect listed in yellow on the card, which have various effects such as healing or drawing extra Fight cards. They then place that Battlefield card next to the gameplay area and all Players are now subject to the changes to the game listed in white on the card until that Battlefield is replaced. Where previously they may have been fighting in the Reaver Valley, where all Attack cards gain +1 value, suddenly they may find themselves battling within the Thief&rsquo;s Maze, where any Deflect cards may be played as Ripostes!&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of Rounds. A Round ends when no Player can play an Attack card, or one Player takes full damage from an Attack without defending in any way. When a Round ends any remaining cards in the Players&rsquo; hands are discarded, as are any persistent Rage card effects on their Reaver. A new hand of cards is dealt to each Player and a new Round begins. The Dealer for the new Round rotates counterclockwise, and the Player to the Dealer&rsquo;s left has Initiative at the beginning of the new Round.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal of Reaverquest is to reduce your opponents&rsquo; Vigor to zero, forcing them to submit to your rule and allowing you to claim the title of Vorpal Reaver.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They have to be extremely sensitive to the other players, and must engage in diplomacy and negotations to an extent previously unknown in Cthulhu Wars.&#10;&#10;Like Yellow Sign, you need to travel across the world. In your case, this is to build Cathedrals in the same areas marked with Symbols as Yellow Sign (though you also have to build one Cathedral in an unmarked area). Fortunately, you have an ace up your sleeve &ndash; other factions often rather like to share their areas with a Cathedral. But you can&rsquo;t always rely on this, and you lack the punch of Yellow Sign&rsquo;s undead army.&#10;&#10;Like most factions, each of your creatures has a spellbook dedicated to it. Unlike every other faction, these spellbooks actually make your creature inferior in some way! However, they&rsquo;re still worth getting for two reasons. First, they make the creature MUCH less expensive, and thus let you have a good combat punch (which you&rsquo;ll need). Second, you can&rsquo;t win the game without all six spellbooks!&#10;&#10;Your special faction ability is Dematerialization, and is useful in movement. Each Doom phase, select one area in which you have units. Move any or all of those units to one other selected area, anywhere on the map. In play, you&rsquo;ll find this useful not only for planned attacks, but also for building your Cathedrals.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The Cathedral, Un-men, Reanimated, and Yothan sculpts are credited to &quot;Tidal 4&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

It is, of course, the original home of the Insects from Shaggai (who made their appearance in Onslaught Two). In those days, the horrendous hellworld Ghroth wandered too near Shaggai, and initiated the process that resulted in Shaggai&rsquo;s complete destruction. The map of course is set during the time of Shaggai&rsquo;s eradication, which is represented by the Worms of Ghroth &ndash; horrendous tools of woe which spread across the surface, leaving oblivion in their wake.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into hex-shaped areas, representing the insectile nature of the world&rsquo;s native inhabitants. Some are oceans, other land, and the game starts with a single Worm of Ghroth &ndash; a harbinger of ruin.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, each Doom phase existing Worms of Ghroth tend to annihilate the areas they are on, and new Worms are spawned. Eradicated areas actually generate power, and can even benefit the players. For example, if your controlled gate gets eradicated, you earn an Elder Sign. For each unit that is eradicated, you earn 1 Power. The Power gain may not be enough to make up for losing a big monster or Great Old One, but at least it helps.&#10;&#10;And, after all, the destruction has been telegraphed by the presence of a Worm &ndash; so you had your chance to escape!&#10;&#10;The Shaggai map has other fun elements. For example, you can &ldquo;jump over&rdquo; Eradicated areas, and thus access the map more easily. This does cost a unit though, so be sure to include someone cheap to sacrifice to the hungry void. Also, if the map deteriorates too far, the game can end regardless of whether anyone has 30 Doom yet. In such a case, all players add up their Doom and Elder Signs and see who is victorious.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The Worm of Ghroth sculpt is credited to &quot;Tidal 4&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Pretty much nothing else is known of them. The design of the Voonith upon sirens and amphisboenas &ndash; these are existing amphibians &amp; reptiles who only have forelegs. So the back half of the Voonith is long &amp; eel-like, while the front part has claws and fangs. The model shows it rearing up, ready to strike. They cost 3 Power, and only have 1 Combat, which may at first seem puny, but wait, there&rsquo;s more!&#10;&#10;The Voonith is a solitary hunter, and I wanted the in-game version to foster that concept. Therefore, its special ability is that if you roll NO kills in a battle involving your Voonith, add 1 kill to your total. Because of this, the Voonith&rsquo;s 1 combat die isn&rsquo;t actually a drawback. If you have 2 Vooniths and roll no kills, you&rsquo;d get 2 kills for free. And yes, if you have 2 Vooniths in Battle and roll only 1 kill, you get a free kill for your deficit. Basically, each Voonith you have provides a guaranteed kill!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The Hound of Tindalos, Wamp, and Voonith sculpts are credited to &quot;Tidal 4&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

When the avatar departs, the victim&rsquo;s body is left transformed, forever a hideous monster. In the box, we provide Dark Demons in every faction color: nine total figures! When you recruit the Dark Demon, all the enemy factions also get one, but theirs is a burden and weakness to them, while yours is more of an asset.&#10;&#10;The Shadow Pharaoh &#10;This manifestation is Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s Egyptian connection, well-known from many stories. The figure itself is a sort of combination of sphinx, scorpion, mummy, pharaoh, and tentacled horror. I really like it, and I think you will too. It has an especially nasty ability which drives cultists off gates, making the gates vulnerable to be captured once the Pharaoh leaves.&#10;&#10;The Bloated Woman&#10;First popularized in the well-known adventure Masks of Nyarlathotep for the Call of Cthulhu system, the Bloated Woman is Nyarlathotep in a rather repulsive female form. She steals killed enemies, and later transforms your gates so they produce Elder Signs rather than Power.&#10;&#10;The Haunter of the Dark&#10;The Haunter of the Dark is a full-on Great Old One. It is awakened as with most independent Great Old Ones &ndash; you need a Gate with your own Great Old One. In the Haunter&rsquo;s case, you spend 6 Power to get the loyalty card, putting it in the same high-end category as game-changers such as Atlach-Nacha, Cthugha, or Daoloth. (Most Independent Great Old Ones only cost 4, or even 2.)&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re Crawling Chaos, you can awaken the Haunter for just 5 Power, and you don&rsquo;t need a Great Old One, so obtaining it is a lot easier, BUT every other faction does get an Elder Sign when you do this.&#10;&#10;The Haunter is explicitly a combat critter. It has a combat of 1 per enemy spellbook (so in theory 0-6, but in practice usually at the high end). I wanted to reflect the fact that one of the Haunter&rsquo;s best-known characteristics is that it can&rsquo;t survive well in the light. Therefore, it actually starts with a weakness, representing this disability &ndash; Fly The Light. This &ldquo;ability&rdquo; states that post-Battle, if the enemy scored only 1 Kill, it MUST be applied to the Haunter. If the enemy scored 2 or more kills though, you can target them normally.&#10;&#10;The Haunter&rsquo;s spellbook is really easy to get &ndash; just spend 1 Power as an action. Trivial. In fact, normally this is the first thing you&rsquo;ll do after awakening the Haunter, which gives your enemies a one-turn window to try to take it out, before you get this frightful pre-Battle ability. It&rsquo;s The Shining Trapezohedron. Before rolling combat dice, your enemy has to roll 1 die per unit he has in the battle. For each Kill he rolls, he must eliminate a unit (his choice).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The Bloated Woman, Shadow Pharaoh, Dark Demon, and Haunter of the Dark sculpts are credited to &quot;Tidal 4&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

How come? Because in order to complete your objectives you have to 'flip&rsquo;n&rsquo;ripple' various Timespots (hexes) which in turn creates further paradoxes and causes your Blot count to start rising (and those of your opponents if they&rsquo;re on the same space, or adjacent to you!) &ndash; And how do you get your Blot count down? By &lsquo;fixing the timeline&rsquo; and putting things back again (called a Resolve action), but this could also benefit your opponents, who will similarly lose Blots for your good deed!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
