    "Description": "When war broke out in August of 1914, the news was met by wildly cheering crowds in Australia. &#10;Following some months of mobilization, the AIF exited the country in November 1914 and, after several delays due to the presence of German naval vessels in the Indian Ocean, arrived in Egypt. Their first task was to defend the Suez Canal. In early 1915, however, it was decided to carry out an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula with the goal of opening up a second front and securing the passage of the Dardanelles. The Australians and New Zealanders, grouped together as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), went ashore on 25 April 1915 and for the next eight months the Anzacs, alongside their British, French and other allies, fought a costly and ultimately unsuccessful campaign against the Turks. The force was evacuated from the peninsula in December 1915 and returned to Egypt, where the AIF was expanded. In early 1916 it was decided that the infantry divisions would be sent to France, where they took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front. Most of the light horse units remained in the Middle East until the end of the war, carrying out further operations against the Turks in Egypt and Palestine.&#10;&#10;Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Driven Out - Mont St. Quentin, France, July 23rd 1916&#10;     The O.G.

Both players can play for the same colour.&#10;     Player 1 rolls their 6 skeleton parts (the bones). If a ribcage in the correct colour can be found all other parts in the same colour can be connected to it.&#10;     Player 2 does the same with his bones. Both players must start with a ribcage, otherwise they have to rattle all the bones again in their next turn.&#10;     Each play picks up the left bones and the die and rolls them together. If a missing part is shown on the die, it can be added to the skeleton. But there is also the colour changing side and the scatter side. Both mean the player has to start again. If the opponent already has the wanted part, the active play may choose to steal it from the opponent.&#10;     The first player to finish their skeleton wins the game. So the game can be over in 2 minutes if luck is on your side.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Crommelin Comet (27P) reaches its closest distance to Earth &#226;&#128;&#146; its periapsis, every 27 years. Scientists have recently discovered a mistake in its orbital calculations and predict that it will collide with Earth in the year 2038!&#10;&#10;There is only one way to prevent this catastrophic event: destroy the comet. A secret experimental rocket station built in 1929, when rocket technology was still in its infancy, is our only hope. In order to complete this mission, a rocket full of explosive cargo must be launched at the comet each time it approaches Earth, weakening and ultimately destroying the menace over the course of four periapsis events.&#10;&#10;Four brave scientists will simultaneously time travel between the last four years of periapsis &#226;&#128;&#146; 1930, 1957, 1984, and 2011, to attempt to destroy the deadly comet. They must ensure the explosive cargo reaches the Rocket Station in time. The only consistent form of travel across these years is rail, so they must build an iron path for the cargo to reach its destination.&#10;&#10;If they can build a track for all four trains to reach the Rocket Station, while repairing damaged rails and navigating obstacles, they can save the planet! But they have to be careful: their choices in the past affect the future, and if any one of the trains falls off the track... the Earth is DOOMED.&#10;&#10;In 27Panic you play cooperatively as a team of scientists building a railroad track in four years simultaneously. You build tracks by playing cards and ones that are built in the past carry forward into the future. You must plan closely with your team in order to strategically build a path for explosive cargo to follow in each year. If you are able to get the cargo to a nearby rocket station in all of the years by avoiding obstacles and repairing damaged tracks, you'll win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It was all for naught, as the country entered the war aligned with Germany and her allies. And mobilization soon began, followed by a declaration of war against Serbia. Around this time the Germans and Austro-Hungarians had penetrated into Serbia on a front that was 140 kilometers in length and 15 kilometers in depth. In order to close the 90-kilometer gap between the flanks of the German 11th Army and the Bulgarian 1st Army Mackensen ordered the latter to invade the valley of the river Morava and take Ni&scaron; and Aleksinac. In accordance with this order the Bulgarians attacked along the entire front of their 1st Army, quickly driving out the Serbian units and taking control of the border area. Following this easy success however the speed of the advance was much reduced due to the bad weather, which turned roads into mud, and a dense fog that sometimes limited visibility to 50 meters. In addition the stiffening Serbian resistance and the mountainous character of the area caused the flanks of the 1st Army to halt before the fortresses of Pirot and Zajecar. The exploits of the Bulgarian 2nd Army in Macedonia convinced the Serbians that the danger of complete encirclement is high and forced them to begin withdrawing their forces to Kosovo while offering stiff but not desperate resistance to Army Group Mackensen. In November, while the decisive Serbian defeat unfolded, the French attempted to exert pressure on the Bulgarian 2nd Army but were soon forced to halt their attempts to drive north.&#10;&#10;Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Pristina Halt - Pristina, Serbia, November 24th 1915&#10;     Fall Back To Lerin - Gornichevo, Salonika Front, September 14th 1916&#10;     The Dobrich Epopee (Epic) - Southern Dobruja, Romania, September 5th 1916&#10;     A Good Field - Dobro Pole, Serbia, September 15th 1918&#10;     Chegan Operation - Banitsa, Serbia, August 17 1916&#10;     Contested Prophet - Sabac, Serbia, September 30th 1916&#10;     Rakija Courage - Gnjilane, Serbia, December 2nd 1915&#10;     Show Of Force - Serbia, August 18 1916&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beyond Tic Tac Ten is played on a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 grids, as is the fake &quot;Tic Tac Ten&quot; game that inspired it. (This appeared in one of the fake ads in an earlier issue of GAMES.)&#10;&#10;Players take turns marking an empty space. After the first move, each move must be made in the 3x3 corresponding to the position of the previous move in its 3x3 grid. E.g. if the first move is made in the upper right corner of its 3x3 grid, the second move must be made in the 3x3 grid in the upper right corner of the &quot;board.&quot;&#10;&#10;The first player to get three spaces in a line (a tic-tac-toe) in a single 3x3 grid wins. However, several variants are suggested, including one in which players try to get tic-tac-toes in three grids in a line, and both players can get a tic-tac-toe in the same grid&#10;&#10;",

The next player to play is determined by the rank of the cards played (higher if different) - count that many players around the table.

If they can't they collect all played cards and also draw cards as indicated by any Draw cards played. (Players may also have to collect cards if they can't play a pair under some circumstances.)&#10;&#10;When a player is out of cards everyone else scores the value of their remaining cards.

    "Description": "Serbia was blamed for the start of World War I following the assassination of Archduke Franz-Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Yet the Serbs would enjoy the first Allied victory of the war, after they drove the Austro-Hungarians out of the town of Sabac on 19 August 1914. Before they could, however, civilians were rounded up in the town and massacred. On the 5 October 1914, Austria launched their offensive against Serbia. The Serbian Army, weakened by Typhus, couldn&rsquo;t hold out and the capital, Belgrade, was evacuated on the 9th. Two days later, Bulgaria declared war on Serbia, hoping to annex the Serb possession of Macedonia. By the 24th, the Bulgarians had driven a wedge between the Serb army and the Allied armies in Greece attempting to come to their aid. The Serbs fought with courage, but found their army critically low on ammunition stocks. With defeat staring them in the face, over 200,000 soldiers and civilians fled over the rugged mountains and into Albania. Many were evacuated by sea to the island of Corfu, in what would stand as the world&rsquo;s largest evacuation by sea until the &lsquo;miracle at Dunkirk&rsquo; in 1940. Surviving Serbian soldiers made their way to Greece, and remained in uniform to serve in the Yugoslav Division of Serbs, Croats, Macedonians, Montenegrins and Slovenes. When Bulgaria surrendered on 30 September 1918, Serb, Yugoslav, French and British forces united to drive the Austrians and Germans out of Serbia.&#10;&#10;Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Delay Before The Drina - Podrinje, Serbia, August 12th 1914&#10;     Kosaningrad - Tekeris, Serbia, August 15th 1914&#10;     Mounted Clash - Tekeris, Serbia, August 16th 1914&#10;     In The Valley Of Jadar - Sabac, Serbia, August 16th 1914&#10;     Back Across The Drina - Cer, Serbia, August 17th 1914&#10;     The Liberation Of Sabac - Sabac, Serbia, August 24th 1914&#10;     The Youngest Corporal - Cer, Serbia, August 14th 1914&#10;     The Battle of Kolubara - Serbia, November 18th 1914&#10;&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of each day, players buy goods in bulk, and rent motorcycles or vans for the transport. Then they begin a journey through different markets. At each market, players can announce that they want to sell goods there. All players who want to sell, pay the required tax, then dice are rolled to determine the selling price. Each market has a maximum capacity, so turn order is important. Players who are not happy with the price can move on, but won&rsquo;t get their taxes back. At the end of the day, vehicles have to be returned, and interest has to be paid on any debts the players may have. Obstacle cards can get in your way, reflecting the risks that small-scale resellers face in their trade.&#10;The player who has made the greatest profit during the three days, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

After several defensive victories in 1917, with different groups competing for authority over the Russian troops in Romania in the aftermath of the October Revolution, Romania signed an armistice at Focani. On November 10, 1918, just one day before the German armistice and when all the other Central Powers had already capitulated, Romania re-entered the war. By then, about 220,000 Romanian soldiers had been killed. Despite their small size, the Germans worried about the prospect of Romania entering the war, Hindenburg writing: &ldquo;It is certain that so relatively small a state as Romania had never before been given a role so important, and, indeed, so decisive for the history of the world at so favorable a moment.&rdquo; Romanian soldiers would fight in battles that would be compared with some of the most brutal campaigns on the Western Front at little-known places like the Bran-C&acirc;mpulung area, the Carpathains, and the Prahova Valley.&#10;&#10;Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Across The Argesch - Arge&#200;&#153; River, Romania, December 3rd 1916&#10;     Stand At Brasso - Brass&oacute;, Transylvania, October 8th 1916&#10;     Sweep Of Cinghinarele Island - Cinghinarele Island, Bulgaria, October 8th 1916&#10;      Erich and August - Silistra, Bulgaria, September 4th 1916&#10;     Turkey Shooters - Amuzaca, Romania, September 24th 1916&#10;     Der Alte Mann - Kohalom, Romania, October 2nd 1916&#10;     Saving Moldavia - Oituz, Romania, August 12th 1917&#10;     Predeal Ordeal - Predeal,Romania, October 23rd 1916&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game is both a co-op and a lone fighter game. For up to 6 players. Despite the complex scope of WoU, the game is also designed to be beginner-friendly. Of course, you will also encounter zombies in the post-apocalypse.&#10;&#10;What is WORLDS of UNIVERSE all about?&#10;The story begins in WORLDS of UNIVERSE Teil 1: Dawn of Terra [Part I] on our earth in the year [now]. The only difference is that the fate of the earth was already determined in the 50s. That is with a fallout, justified by a desperate attempt to stop a pandemic. A foreign virus-transformed 60 percent of the population into zombie-like mutant beings.&#10;&#10;The humans, as they are, destroyed themselves afterward. The chaos in the new world brings WoU to a post-apocalyptic journey in which players can play their own hero. Due to the disintegration from 1950 onwards, the world in WoU contains both old-fashioned things that have stood still in their time, as well as technical achievements over the years of development.&#10;&#10;While some live in the Outland, empires, and elites in their futuristic districts are forging new plans for power over a new unified world. On the other hand, two camps are striving for only one thing; to survive. This is exactly where the players come into play. You are allowed to join one of the camps, do jobs, and advance the main story. And as expected in a zombie survival board game, actually also zombie, mutants, something ugly ?&#10;Note: This game has no connection through the Covid19 events, the content was written by me three years ago.

Like with other Envyra expansions, it is easy to implement with only a few seconds needed to understand the rules.&#10;Envyra remains the same fast and clever simultaneous action game, but now with even more options and infinite fun.&#10;&#10;Infinity expansion is compatible with all other Envyra expansions. Not playable in ANDRENALINE MODE.&#10;&#10;- - - - - - -&#10;&#10;CONTENT:&#10;1 Infinity Tile&#10;2 Wild Tiles&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;After the tiles are sorted during the setup (step 1), mix 2 Wild Tiles with other 'S' marked Tiles and mix 1 Infinity Tile with other (Basic) Tiles.&#10;&#10;- - -&#10;&#10;RULES (Infinity Tile):&#10;Infinity Tile is very special. Cubes placed on this tile are never to be returned to their owners during the game (except the situation when all player's cubes are removed from the Grid).&#10;The player can target the Infinity Tile during Phase I only if this player is targeting another eligible tile with their second cube as well. That means the player cannot target the Infinity Tile with a single cube placement in Phase I.&#10;Be careful not to place your cubes on this tile too early as you may have very limited capturing options for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;The player with the most cubes on Infinity Tile at the end of the game adds 8 points to their total. If more players have the most cubes (same number) placed on the Infinity Tile, they each gain 8 points divided by the number of tied players rounded down (i.e. each of two tied players gets 4 points, each of three tied players gets 2 points, etc.).&#10;&#10;- - -&#10;&#10;RULES (Wild Tiles):&#10;Wild Tiles belong to all three themes (Green/Blue/Orange). The solar system symbol is unique to all three themes (the Fifth Symbol). Wild Tile could be captured by the player like any other tile.&#10;The owner of the tile can choose which theme this tile belongs to and they can change this theme/color affiliation each round. That means Wild Tile can help the player acquire restricted tiles with different theme icons each round. Note that the Wild Tile could represent only one theme/color each round.&#10;&#10;Example:&#10;There are two restricted tiles in the Playing Grid. The first restricted tile displays 1 green and 2 orange icons on the right side and the second tile displays 1 blue, 1 green, and 1 orange icon. A player owns 1 green tile and 2 Wild Tiles thus this player is eligible to move their cube on any of these restricted tiles, but it can't move their cube on both during the same round.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;During the scoring, a player can choose again which theme their Wild Tile would belong to and add a unique solar system symbol to the set of that theme/color.  &#10;The Black Star symbol with the '-2' VP mark means that the player owning the tile must deduct 2 VP points from their total during scoring.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

From late 1914 until mid-1915, the British defend the Suez Canal, taking on various Turkish and Senussi irregulars in their attempts to capture or damage the canal, to block it. A major victory was earned in August 1916, at Rumani, near the coast. This success relieved pressure on the Suez Canal. The British then began to construct a railway and supply roads along the coast. Operations continued against the Senussi in the Western Desert. This part of the campaign saw Sollum shelled by German U-Boats, and an Emergency Squadron of the Royal Naval Armoured Car Division sent to strengthen the British post there. Both Sollum and Sidi Barrani were subjected to Arab raids. The 2nd New Zealand Rifle Brigade, one company of 15th Sikhs, a detachment of the Bikanir Camel Corps, an Egyptian Army Machine Gun Section and an armoured train garrisoned by 1/10th Ghurka Rifles, moved on 21 December 1915 to hold the Alexandria - Debaa railway, and to patrol to the Moghara oasis against more Senussi incursions. Battles would rage back and forth at places like Matruh, Sidi Barrani, made famous later, when the Desert Fox Erwin Rommel enter the annals of military history. The Senussi were finally defeated with the use of modern weaponry including armored cars, aircraft and artillery.&#10;&#10;Ownership ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of various cards, a Player Board for each player, and a score tracker board.&#10;&#10;One player is the Dilemma Boss, and chooses two cards from the deck of prompts. They choose one to ask the rest of the group. The other players then respond with follow-up questions, to try and define the parameters of the hypothetical situation.&#10;&#10;The Dilemma Boss gets to make up any answers they like about the situation. In this way, the round becomes a type of group storytelling exercise.&#10;&#10;Once all players are satisfied that they know how to respond to the dilemma, everyone answers for themselves secretly on their own Player Board, and also plays a limited number of Guess Cards on other players' boards.&#10;&#10;Upon the reveal, explanations are given, and correct guesses earn points. The number of points scales with how many other players guessed on the same person.&#10;&#10;The game is created and published by Cut.com, creators of Truth or Drink and Fear Pong.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A group of nomadic sea travelers were forced to inhabit two islands in the cold and distant northern hemisphere centuries ago. These rugged people somehow survived the tidal apocalypse when a comet damaged the planet&rsquo;s moon, however they did not escape the wrath of the comet completely. Dust-like particles from the comet penetrated the atmosphere affecting only their small area of the arctic world. It would be decades before the true nature of this unknown infectivity would be realized.&#10;&#10;On the island of Svalrland, the conditions of life were harsh. Living in a frozen tundra, in constant low light and darkness required a hardiness not known to most. But the contamination of the comet&rsquo;s dust took form in strange and haunting ways in this environment. Children were disappearing, blood stains in the snow were consistently found and inhuman sounds could be heard almost every night. Things not seen before in this world had arrived. The truth was that some of the inhabitants had transformed into what many might describe as monsters. Some became ravenous and bloodthirsty, but most had a moderate level of control over both their appearance and habits. These people became the powers of their conclaves and once each recognized that they were not alone, they formed a more cohesive ideology.&#10;&#10;The other island was called Annarr and the conditions were not as harsh. There was a healthy population of animals and just enough warmth to have a limited food supply. People developed a strong bond with the animals living around them. At first it seemed innocent, like loving a family pet. However, many began experiencing a cerebral link to the beasts. All who formed a bond would experience a distinct variation of the connection. Sight, smell, sound, power and even thoughts could be found through these links. These people were seen by the collective as remarkable and they became tribal leaders, gaining influence through the relationship with the different species.&#10;&#10;As the resources on both islands became exhausted, leadership decided it was time to search for new lands. They took to the seas once more and in time arrived one foggy day at the shores of Novus. There was a particularly uninhabited area of harsh cliffs and rough terrain which these wanderers took for themselves. The leadership of both islands were aware that there was a potential darkness hiding amongst them, so they decided to use their skills and knowledge of the waters to disguise their true nature and power. They found Factions controlling the city and chose to join the ranks by declaring themselves a new Faction named Waterborne.&#10;The secrets of Waterborne are real. Their powers are stranger than fiction. Can they take advantage of these powers or will the other Factions discover how much of a threat they pose and align against them? Waterborne is coming and they will explore an entirely new mechanic to bring to the field of battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Meanwhile, the crew of sunken K&ouml;nigsberg, and its 4.1 inch (100mm) guns, were folded into the Schutztruppe. The British reinforced. The Belgians reinforced. The German commander Lettow-Vorbeck fought a costly battle at Mahiwa, with 519 German casualties and 2,700 British casualties in the Nigerian brigade. &#10;This faraway theater saw some of the most dramatic fighting, amidst some of the world&rsquo;s most stirring terrain, during World War I.&#10;&#10;Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Under Kilimanjaro - Kahe, German East Africa, March 21st 1916&#10;     The End of Neutrality - Taveta, German East Africa, August 15th 1914&#10;     Adui Tayari (the Enemy is Ready) - Tanga, German East Africa, November 4th 1914&#10;     Ras-Kasone Bug Out - Ras-Kasone, German East Africa, November 5th 1914&#10;     Empty Hills - Burungi Mountians, German East Africa, May 9th 1916&#10;     Effective Effendi - Kondoa-Irangi, German East Africa, June 13th 1916&#10;     Along The Tanganjikabahn - Usoke, German East Africa, September 3rd 1916&#10;     Along The Wami - Derkawa, German East Africa, August 13th 1916&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Perilous Expeditions Set is a new Narrative Campaign mode that expands Shadows of Brimstone in exciting new directions. The heart of the Perilous Expeditions Set is the Narrative Campaign Book which includes all the Rules, Campaign Objectives, Story Threads, Enemy Lists, Expedition Hazard Charts for Land and for Sea, for both the Norse Coast and the Jungle Island Chain, as well as a host of other new material, including 8 brand new Missions for use with the Expedition Ship Board, the Wilderness Encounter Board, and some unique Campaign Story Missions. Heroes use the Gold and Dark Stone they collect on Missions to upgrade their Expedition Camp and Ship over the course of the Campaign, unlocking new options and powerful bonuses as the Darkness grows ever-stronger. Heroes explore the Campaign Map to reveal Adventure Locations, travel to OtherWorlds and back, hunting down Campaign Clues that lead you through the Story, and eventually (if you survive the perils thrown at you) reaching a climactic final push to defeat whichever powerful creature or sinister scheme the Darkness has unleashed upon the world!&#10;&#10;Double-sided Expedition Ship and Wilderness Encounter Boards are used when your ship or camp is attacked by Enemies. Each of the three new Board types is double-sided, with unique content for Viking and Conquistador play. The Expedition Ship Board is a tactical Game Board for fighting off Enemies that attack your Ship and crew at sea, allowing you to move around the deck of the ship repelling boarders and protecting key areas of the ship and crew. This board features a Viking Long Ship on one side and a Spanish Tall Ship on the other. The Wilderness Encounter Board is a tactical Game Board for having battles on land as your Heroes trek through the uncharted territory on your journeys. It can also represent your Expedition Camp being attacked by Enemies! This board features a Snowy Forest on one side and Jungle Pathways on the reverse. The Campaign Map Board is a strategic Game Board for playing out the Campaign Rounds between Missions, allowing your Heroes to sail the seas on your Expedition Ship and make landfall to seek out Adventure Locations, progressing the story and launching narrative Missions as you explore the region. This board features an icy Norse Coast region on one side and a Jungle Island Chain on the reverse.&#10;&#10;Two new Enemy types are included: Deep Stalkers are terrifying fish-men that climb aboard ships that stray into their oceanic domain, kidnapping the crew for their dark feedings. Leviathan Tentacles are the long, squid-like tentacles of a massive Leviathan, that rise up from the deep to attack Heroes at sea, or those that linger too close to the coastlines.&#10;&#10;A set of Custom dice are included for dynamic travel around the Campaign Map, as well as for use in some Expedition Hazards and Camp Site Events. These Expedition Dice are marked with special Icons for Marching, Sailing, and Navigation, and determine how and where the Expedition can move during each Campaign Round.&#10; In addition, the set contains all of the cards, rules and counters needed for Campaign play, with Camp Site Upgrades, Expedition Ship Upgrades, Plot Twists, Campaign Objectives, Story Threads, Enemy Lists, Expedition Hazard Charts for Land and for Sea, and 8 new Missions, to keep things exciting and ever-changing as you progress through the interactive story!&#10;&#10;-description from Kickstarter campaign&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Once the greatest kingdom in the Northern Reach of Trederra, the Kharkodan Monarchy was overthrown in a revolution by its legions of workers and peasants. The King was killed and his armies scattered. His fortress reduced to rubble under the heavy bombardment of the people's arsenal. Escaping into the mountain cities of Tredesh, the Queen and her Royal Guard now reside in exile. Biding their time and growing their numbers, the Monarchy has begun their campaign to crush the rebellious Kharkarus Konfederacy that drove them out and reclaim their rightful place on the throne. Trained in deadly close quarters fighting, the Monarchy Royal Guard go to war wielding twin ceremonial blades that can slice a man in two with one swift stroke. Decked out in the heavy furs and ornate armor of the Queen's Regiment, the Royal Guard are second to none in discipline, battle prowess, and sheer ruthlessness. They will stop at nothing to crush their enemies. For the Crown!&#10;&#10;This Mission Pack introduces the Trederran Monarchy Royal Guard. Though few in numbers, they are perhaps the most highly trained and deadly warriors in all of Trederra. With 4 new Missions that form a short story campaign, a new Objective Room Map Tile, a host of new cards including Threats, Artifacts, Enemy Traits, Darkness, and more, as well as the Enemy Record Sheet, Rules, and 6 Monarchy Royal Guard models, this Mission Pack is an exciting addition to the lore of Trederra and your games of Shadows of Brimstone.&#10;&#10;PAINTER'S NOTE: the Trederran Monarchy are their own faction of Trederra. For players that paint their figures, the Trederran Monarchy have their own paint scheme and are independent of existing Trederran Legionnaire color schemes from the previously released Trederra Deluxe OtherWorld Expansion.&#10;&#10;- Description from the Publisher&#10;&#10;",

It's recommended to play with a group of people, preferably 3 or more players. Each round, one player picks a phrase card and a mission card. The player will use that phrase to earn points by way of one of the various mission cards. Some mission cards will prompt other players to win the round.&#10;&#10;CONCEPT: The game revolves around one phrase created by two words picked at random. Once the phrase is chosen the player uses that phrase with a mission card for the round. Each mission has it's own point system and you play to 18 points. In a nutshell, it's a modern rendition of play on words for adults.&#10;&#10;RISKY: Be prepared to earn points by way of prank calls, social media, being creative with play on words, or drinking something. Before you know it this will be the best card game for you and your friends that is played at every party or game night!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Forbidden Sigil is a 1 vs many hybrid dungeon crawler/skirmish game for 2 - 6 players.&#10;&#10;The heroes are long dead and only the vicious endure in a world overrun with demonic influence and cruelty. As a powerful monster or villain, you must enter the Dungeon of the Wound. A  labyrinthine hellscape where a forbidden power has torn a  wound on the very fabric on which reality is writ. You must explore the procedurally generated game board to find The Wound, defeat the powerful Dimensional Wound Guardian, and escape with your lives.&#10;&#10;PROCEDURIALL GENERATED BOARD:&#10;&#10;The dungeon board is comprised of 16 room tiles which are shuffled before each game ensuring the dungeon is never the same twice. Explore the dungeon rooms by flipping room tiles as you enter them. But beware, powerful roaming monsters lurk in the depths that will take cunning and cooperation to defeat.&#10;&#10;CHESS LIKE COMBAT:&#10;&#10;Combat is played on separate combat board where strategic movement is as important as your party configuration and character abilities. An easy to learn but challenging to master combat system the requires you to position and respond your enemies every move.&#10;&#10;BUILD YOUR PARTY:&#10;&#10;Play as one of the 7 initially playable characters or one of dozens of unlockable and secret characters who will join your ranks as the emergent story mechanics unfolds an epic tale. &#10;Select your party members to take advantage of synergist team work and fill your party roles to fit your playstyle. Level up your characters to unlock new powers and gain access to elite gear and armor sets.&#10;&#10;1 VS MANY OR TEAM BASED:&#10;&#10;Play as The summoner, a powerful character who controls the monster and elite demons in the dungeon, as well as the Summoner Demon: A customizable character who levels up like party members and who has access to the Sigil Board. The Summoner draws from the energies party members spend in the dungeon. Each time a powerful ability is used, or a wrong choice is made, The Summoner places tiles on The Sigil Board to unlock abilities, treasure, and powerful demons.&#10;&#10;THE FORBIDDEN SIGIL APP:&#10;&#10;Use the optional, but highly recommended app, to play &lsquo;Dungeon Scenarios.&rsquo; Dramatic video of Octavia, an ancient and morally ambiguous demon queen who will present you with multiple choice scenarios which connect to each other and result in a cascading story tree that makes each one of your decision significant and consequential. Each Dungeon Scenario has at least three possible courses of action with many more possibly results. Literally tens of thousands of combinations can unfold which guarantees every game is different than the last.&#10;&#10;PLAY A ONE OFF OR A SERIES:&#10;&#10;Play a quick One Off game with friends or commit to a series, where more powerful gear can be unlocked and the sprawling story unfolds across several chapters.&#10; SEMI LEGACY GAMEPLAY:&#10;&#10;Unlock town upgrades which will allow you to use new characters, over 200 pieces of unique gear or even learn how to tame the monsters of the dungeon to use in combat.&#10;Explore cascading story trees which plays out vastly differently each game based on your decisions.   &#10;All legacy mechanics are non-destructive and reset whenever you want them to.&#10;&#10;Yes, the heroes are long dead, but perhaps it is monsters that are needed now. Perhaps it is only the damaged and deranged who dare to close the wound once more, by wielding the power of The Forbidding Sigil&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Human units can withdraw if in a tight spot (zombies can't). Humans can also recruit new troops, including heroes with special abilities, while the zombies can turn defeated humans into zombies. Humans win if they can defeat all zombies, if the health level reaches 10 points or the infection marker reaches the field for &quot;human victory&quot;. Zombies win if the infection marker reaches &quot;zombie victory&quot;, or if they defeat all humans or occupy all three capitals.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kroma is a color-blending strategy game for two or three players.&#10;&#10;Gameplay takes place on a triangular playing board that has a light behind it so that you can better see the colors created by the game pieces during play. On a turn, you draw a playing piece from the bag &mdash; feeling for a desired shape, if you wish, but not knowing the color of the piece &mdash; then place that piece in any legal location on the board. Pieces come in yellow, cyan, and magenta, and initially you must play these pieces on the lowest level of the game board. If you can play a piece so that it's entirely supported by other pieces, then you can play on the second level of the board; by doing this, you can create the secondary colors green, orange, and purple &mdash; and this is what you'll need to do to win.&#10;&#10;Each player in the game is assigned a secondary color, and at the end of a three-player game, whoever has more spaces of their color showing wins. In a two-player game, the player with the largest contiguous block of their color wins, so the game is more about blocking than simply creating your color wherever you can. If you're green, for example, you want lots of yellow and cyan on the bottom level so that you can potentially transform it into green later, while magenta is useless to you and ideally you can stack magenta pieces on top of one another to put them out of play altogether.&#10;&#10;The game ends once all the pieces have been played or when no piece remaining in the bag can fit on the board.&#10;&#10;",

Belgian soldiers fought a number of significant delaying actions in 1914 during the initial invasion. At the Battle of Li&egrave;ge, the town's fortifications held off the invaders for over a week, buying valuable time for Allied troops to arrive in the area. Additionally, the German &ldquo;Race to the Sea&rdquo; was stopped dead by exhausted Belgian forces at the Battle of the Yser.&#10;Belgians saw action in East Africa. Congolese forces, under Belgian officers, fought German colonial forces in the Cameroons and seized control of the western third of German East Africa, advancing as far as the town at Tabora.&#10;&#10;Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     The Bridge At Vise - Vise, Belgium, August 4th 1914&#10;     Between The Meuse And The Vesdre - Fort Barchon, Belgium, August 5th 1914&#10;     Elan And Bayonets - Belgium, August 5th 1914&#10;     The Retreat Of The 800 - Haneffe, Belgium, August 14th 1914&#10;     Black Devils And Car No. 7 - Werchter, Belgium, September 8th 1914&#10;     The Death Trench - Yser Dyke, Belgium, June 2nd 1915&#10;     Lancers and Uhlans - Ciney, Belgium, September 14th 1914&#10;     A Baron In The Bag - Chaudfontaine, Belgium, August 4th 1914&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Striking from the shadows, the Cobarri Headhunters surround their prey, cutting them down with brutal efficiency. With flared hoods and forked tongue, the Cobarri can spit venom in the face of their foes, deflecting blows with their ornate shields and slicing through the toughest armor using swords lined with volcanic Dark Stone, chipped to a razor's edge. Mercenary warriors, the Cobarri Headhunters do not belong to any one Tribe, but sell their swords for gold and glory in the name of Ke'Ke Na, the Serpent God of Death!&#10;&#10;This Mission Pack introduces the Cobarri Headhunters of Jargono. With 4 new Missions that form a short story campaign, a new Objective Room Map Tile, a host of new cards including Threats, Artifacts, Enemy Traits, Darkness, and more, as well as the Enemy Record Sheet, Rules, and 6 Cobarri Headhunter models, this Mission Pack is an exciting addition to the Swamps of Jargono and your games of Shadows of Brimstone.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",
