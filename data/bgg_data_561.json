Players are truck drivers trying to earn money by transporting goods from city to city, through the dangerous deserts where battles with bandits can be fatal.&#10;&#10;The first player to save enough money to buy out his truck is the winner.&#10;&#10;The name of this Finnish game is &quot;Battletruck&quot; in English. While probably a completely domestic design, it was almost certainly inspired by the 1982 film of the same name, as well as other post-apocalyptic road movies popular at the time, such as the Mad Max series.&#10;&#10;",

Furthermore you can get jokers from spinning/dice rolling which allow free selection of the placing field.&#10;The game ends after 4 rounds of chip placement or after a set amount of cash has been earned what ever you decide at the beginning.&#10;&#10;",

The players choose the game length prior to play - from a &quot;Short Game&quot; (3 Artifacts) to a &quot;Full Game&quot; (9 Artifacts).&#10;&#10;Basic game play is for an Artifact and a number of actions (Fate cards) to be displayed.  Players collect action cards into their hand attempting to collect a meld of 8 different suites in order to claim the artifact.  If no player can claim the Artifact, it remains in play for the next round.&#10;&#10;Artifacts currently in player control and optionally disposed of action cards can be used to modify the flow of the game.&#10;&#10;",

On a player's turn, the die is rolled and depending on the bee that appears, the player draws a card (different bees have different degrees of difficulty) with a word to spell on it. The card is passed to the player on the left, who acts as Beekeeper and says the word on the card. All other players try to spell the word on their writing pad. If the player whose turn it is spells it correctly the player gets the indicated number of beez which are then placed on a honeycomb board; if that player misspells the word, the other players who spelled the word correctly get a beez, Rolling the Stinger causes a missed turn, and the Queen Bee gives the opportunity to earn double the number of beez.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Penny Push Game&#10;&#10;A very simple but enjoyable game that combines&#10;basic physical agility and strategy.&#10;&#10;Use 6 pennies or dimes on a smooth tabletop (great for playing at a cafe).&#10;&#10;Each player on opposite sides of the table places&#10;3 coins on the table in a triangle, approx. 3 inches&#10;apart (one player can be heads and the other&#10;tails).&#10;&#10;Each player takes turns flicking a coin with his&#10;finger so that it passes in between his other two&#10;coins, thus moving his triangle step by step&#10;across the table.&#10;&#10;No coin can be moved twice in a row, so with each&#10;move the coin must pass far enough between the&#10;other two coins to leave enough room for the next&#10;move.&#10;&#10;The game can end in four ways.&#10;&#10;When a player moves a coin, that player loses if:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The coin fails to pass completely between the other two coins&#10;     The coin falls off the edge of the table, or&#10;     The coin touches any other coin.&#10;&#10;&#10;That player wins if none of the above occur, and&#10;the coin passes completely through two sides of&#10;the opposing player's triangle of coins.&#10;&#10;The strategy of the game is to move your coins&#10;cautiously into range of the other player's&#10;coins, putting them in position to take a shot&#10;through your opponent's triangle without leaving&#10;your coins too far apart and vulnerable to&#10;attack. You look for an opening without leaving&#10;yourself open. The edge of the table can be used&#10;as a defensive position.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in matches, playing up to&#10;a predetermined number of wins, or best of a set&#10;number of games.&#10;&#10;",

Each class has its share of natural and item-related benefits.&#10;&#10;Along the way other non-player characters may appear - &quot;Legends&quot; - which, should players encounter them, affect play.  Legends come into play when the board's &quot;Hot Action&quot; counter is raised by various activities.  Legends include Howlin' Wolf and Ol' Scratch.&#10;&#10;",
