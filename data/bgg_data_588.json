I also attempted to keep casualties realistic.  That is why I chose the D20 as the combat die.  It is not easy to inflict casualties in Guns of Liberty, but morale plays a decisive role in the game.  The quality of forces can make up for lack of numbers, while militia poses a wildcard.  With they stand and deliver or will they scatter at the first sound of the guns?  The variable Fire, Melee, and Morale values allow to make mild, yet significant, differences between troops.&quot;&#10;&#10;More information:&#10;&#10;Guns of Liberty is designed for 15mm miniatures.  One inch on the table equals 25 yards.

Many more of the movements, particularly those that concern tactical reactions to enemy moves and movements of less-reliable troops, have been randomized. A new combat mode has been added to represent the protracted firefight between bodies of formed infantry. We have also included new tests of commander and troop resolve at the maneuver element level. These will work more than ever to increase the need for reserves and limit the numerous and unrealistic fights to the last man, and hopeless charges which plague so many games.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

This book is a stand alone set of rules based on it's predecessor Classical Hack III: Hack in the Dark and is profusely illustrated with diagrams, photographs and charts. Most players are able to play the game without much, if any, help after turn three. The primary change from First Edition is the use of a D-10 system from a percentile based casualty calculation. The first part of the book describes the basics of the game in regard to unit generation, movement and shooting. The remainder of the book is designed around the turn sequence. This takes the player basically through a typical turn describing each turn event in sequence.&#10;&#10;Scale 1&quot; = 150' for 15mm and 25mm figures. Each turn = 15 to 20 minutes. Figure scale is flexible, from 5 to 200 men. Table size 4' x 6' or larger.&#10;&#10;The end of the book contains a section on Special Add-on Tactics. There is also a general Q.R.S. or Quick Reference Sheet for playing the game. There are 39 Army Lists and four scenarios, plus play aids. Besides having a comprehensive Table of Contents there is an Index; which is not always found in game systems of this type.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher's information:&#10;Manoeuvre Group is designed to fight all arms actions in the period from 1941 to at least 2010, using forces up to a Company Group (Battle Group in US terminology). That is, up to 8 tanks, 1 or 2 platoons of supporting infantry and their supporting close reconnaissance, engineering and artillery assets, in an evening. The innovative rule system means no book keeping. At this scale the battles are fought at close quarters, in relatively dense terrain, be it urban or rural, from England to Iraq and all points in between. Manoeuvre Group&rsquo;s emphasis is just that, the command of manoeuvre units to eliminate the enemy. The reading of the ground, timing and employment of all arms assets are the key to winning a battle. The player will spend more time moving units about to exploit weaknesses in the enemy&rsquo;s plan than calculation of hit factors and dice rolling. The rules capture the ebb and flow of a battle often missing in other rules. With practise, experts (in tactics) can achieve 10 to 15 bounds in an evening even with a full Company Group.&#10;&#10;",
