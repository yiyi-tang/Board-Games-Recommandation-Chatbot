It's designed for nestorgames' game system Nestortiles.&#10;&#10;The game's objective is to &quot;knot&quot; a piece of &quot;textile&quot;, which is made of smaller parts, so called &quot;patches&quot;.&#10;&#10;The players freely choose any colored tile from a supply and create the patches by putting tiles together and always following the main rule of allowed color patterns: the same color may not occur on any two orthogonally or diagonally adjacent tiles. If a player decides to add a patch (or if the patch reaches its maximum size of five) it is &quot;knotted&quot; to the main textile in the middle of the table. The players then score points by the formula &quot;knotting sides x size of the patch&quot;. After all tiles are played, the winner is the one with the highest total score.&#10;&#10;",

Players alternate throwing a die and moving forward that number of spaces, each moving from the center, on the ball, in the opposite direction toward the goal they wish to score. Certain spaces on the track award fouls, throw-ins, penalties, and offsides that result in the player's marker being moved forward or backward on the track.&#10;&#10;If a player is close enough to their chosen goal (space 25), they score a goal by rolling a number high enough to go past 25. Landing on 25 itself allows the goalie to make the save and punt the ball back to space 5.&#10;&#10;Either side scoring a goal sends both player's markers back to the ball in the center to start again. It is recommended to play a &quot;best of 5&quot; match.&#10;&#10;",

After the first turn, they alternate having first choice of where to place. Tiles must touch any edge of at least one tile that is already played, or of a location the opponent has currently chosen.&#10;&#10;Hiding the front side from the opponent to conceal the tile's rotation, they position their tiles upright with its edge on the table. Simultaneously, when their tiles are both touching the table, they tip their tiles toward each other so the tiles are laying down on the table. Repeat.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to form three target shapes with their own color and the opponent's color.&#10;&#10;Look for a Black rock which crushes a White scissors, for instance. The game would immediately end in a victory for Black-- unless a White paper is formed at the exact same time, and covers the Black rock. That's one point for White and one point for Black. In that case, the game continues until one player has at least one more winning shape combination on the board than the other. If the score is still tied when the last tiles are played, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;It is possible for two tiles to be part of multiple shapes. For example, a White scissors and White paper can share two tiles and still qualify as two complete shapes.&#10;&#10;Strategy Basics:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pay attention to what structures your opponent is building, and disrupt them if necessary.&#10;     Remember, with every tile, you are placing your own color and your opponent's color.&#10;     &quot;Telegraph punches that you're not throwing.&quot; Get your opponent to believe you're building toward a particular victory, and suddenly switch to build a different one.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Amidst the ringing clash of steel and the thunder of charging steeds the bold Saxon knights have chosen you to lead them into battle against the hated Normans. Players will compete in grand tournaments of joust, siege castles and raid enemy strongholds in their attempt to find the lost crown of England. Enlisting the support of Robin Hood, players will have to outwit their enemies to control England and restore order to a war-torn land.&quot;&#10;&#10;Game Description&#10;&#10;Defender of the Crown is set in the Middle Ages, where following the death of King Richard, players assume the role of a Saxon lord, try to fight off Norman hordes and ultimately wrestle for complete control of England.  The players will collect valuable resources to build strongholds, amass armies and fight for control of opponents' castles and territories.&#10;&#10;Players may engage enemy lords with their armies on the battlefield or contest lands and fame in medieval tournaments.  They may also loot the treasuries of opposing lords or lay siege to their castles.  Players must also contend with random events such as plague, drought, locusts while fighting for their right to be crowned King of England.&#10;&#10;Once a player has taken control of all enemy counties they will be crowned king and win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Up to 4 players have to fulfill one desire of prince Piast: construct a city from scratch. &#10;Players manage their districts of a newly built town. They have three years, each divided by four seasons, to achieve their final goal: build the most impressive district. In every season players have a couple of actions, represented by rectangular blocks. They can build houses, city walls, and public buildings from them. Discarding them gives players the opportunity to move in citizens and purchase estates beyond the city limit. Finally, players have the possibility to gather resources: wood (needed to construct the buildings), food (needed to feed the citizens and buy an additional action block), and money (needed for estates purchasing). But beware: these actions have an influence on every player and could have a negative impact on unprepared!&#10;In the middle of the board is placed a wheel of time, turning at the end of every season. This natural clock distributes possible citizen tokens and estate cards between players. &#10;Every player have also three tiles with specific missions from the prince. These wishes change every year and let to grant players more favor from the ruler.&#10;&#10;",

This player wants to off as many other players as possible before someone catches his murderous wink and accuses him of the crimes.&#10;&#10;In Eye for an Eye, the players belong to a group of priests in Britannia known as the Ovates. From the rules: &quot;It is the dream of every Ovate to become a Druid, but the test is a terrible one requiring courage,intelligence and stamina.&quot; One to three Druids hide among the group of Ovates, and they can hypnotize an Ovate by winking at that players. The Druids don't know one another's identities, but if one Druid winks at another, the wink has no effect. The game ends when either only one Ovate remains unhypnotized (this player being the game's loser for failing to detect any Druids after so much opportunity) or an Ovate accuses someone of being a Druid (in which one or the other player is the game's loser). The loser must then perform the tests chosen by players at the start of the game from the included deck of 34 tests, with the test categories being &quot;Gallantry&quot;, &quot;Find Out About Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Be Shy&quot; and &quot;Surprise&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Austrlian Wink Death features a more traditional approach to the party game, with one player being the winker and up to 32 others being the winkees. The murder victims die in the manner depicted on their character card. Any player can accuse another of being the winker, but should the accusation prove incorrect, then both players are out and the game continues. Wink Death includes rules for three other games that use the same deck of cards.&#10;&#10;",

The pips on all 6 of each die's sides must initially total no more than 21. (This will change throughout gameplay.)&#10;     Players then ROLL their dice, with high roll winning.

In a multiplayer game, losers engage in a single roll-off to determine who gets to choose, with the LOSER winning that right.&#10;     A GAME lasts until one player has won six* ROUNDs.&#10;     A MATCH lasts until one player has won three* GAMEs.&#10;     Between GAMEs, each player must build a new custom D6 whose pips add up to no more than 21.&#10;&#10;&#10;* This number may be reduced to shorten the game if more than two are playing.&#10;&#10;For information on the interesting properties of custom D6 dice, search the Internet for 'Sicherman Dice' and 'Non-Transitive Dice'.&#10;&#10;",

Includes instructions for simple model construction, scenarios, etc. Designed to be played on the front of your refrigerator, but there's no reason it can't be used for evocative fast play AWI/Napoleonic naval war on a horizontal surface.&#10;&#10;In Franklin's Sea Columbus actually sailed off the edge of the world. There being no new world, Ben Franklin was undistracted by politics and discovered not only electricity, but fantastic secrets about the Earth's magnetic field that would allow the new copper-bottomed ships to sail safely over the edge of the world and down the ocean on the side. This began a new age of exploration and exploitation, and literally new horizons.&#10;&#10;Players command naval groups of two to six ships sailing and fighting on a vertical surface. Movement rules include wind direction and handling differences between different classes of ships, as well as drifting down the sea, of course. Ships are rated for broadside dice and boarding dice. Range reduces firepower.  The effects of damage are noted right on the simple record sheet for easy reference. With lucky rolls enemy ships can strike very quickly, or they may be beaten down with many shots. A ship that loses all its sails will be unable to resist drifting downward toward the abyss...&#10;&#10;Game stats and construction plans included for 18 gun sloop of war, 44 gun frigate, 74 gun ship of the line, and 500 ton merchantman. Three scenarios included, two quite asymmetrical and one straightforward shoot 'em up with multiple large ships.&#10;&#10;Simple but pleasing ship models are constructed from craft sticks, paper clips, paper, glue, etc with ordinary tools and glue.&#10;&#10;(author's note)&#10;&#10;",

It consists of two parts. During the first part, players roll dice to land on different locations on the moon map, collecting points for doing so. Some of the locations may have the lost spaceship. As soon as the lost spaceship is rescued, everyone moves back to the base, collecting additional points along the way. This game is mostly luck but features an accurate lunar map and encourages players to learn lunar locations and some noteworthy lunar missions.&#10;&#10;",

Everything is fitted into three broad categories (squads, commanders, and tankmecha), with some options for further characterization by special rules (extra armour, flight capability, etc). All combat is resolved by rolling six-sided dice, and all measurement is in terms of Lengths (any length unit the players agree on - the game accomodates miniatures of any scale if you chose a sensible length of a Length).

    "Description": "Atlantis &amp; Trisland is a full size, full color mounted expansion that folds to a size that will fit in both the Steam and Age of Steam boxes. While both maps are island based, they couldn&rsquo;t be more different: Atlantis is an epic map focusing on the struggles of the island nation to somehow create a self-sustaining rail network that reaches the shore from a central hub of production, while Trisland is a 3-player-only map with elegant simplicity and symmetry.&#10;&#10;Atlantis takes place on the mythical island of lore, where you&rsquo;ll need to figure out how the giant city of Atlantia in the center of the island can reach the towns and cities along the coast. It&rsquo;s expensive, production is very limited, and the competition is brutal. Atlantis was originally designed 5 years ago, but was deemed too harsh and unforgiving for even the bravest players...it was shelved and only recently picked up again and tweaked to make it slightly more friendly, with an emphasis on slightly. Bankruptcy or utter hopelessness is almost always just around the corner when playing this map. Atlantis is for 3-6 players who are comfortable seeing their opponents weep uncontrollably.&#10;&#10;Trisland is the perfect 3 player map. By perfect, not only is gameplay streamlined and optimized for 3 players, but it is also perfectly symmetrical. Very few rule tweaks are included with the map, making this a perfect &ldquo;classic&rdquo; Steam/Age of Steam playing experience for three players. The rule changes that are present are specifically designed to address the shortcomings of Steam/Age of Steam when played with three players. Trisland is for 3 players, and 3 players only.&#10;&#10;The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 7 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double size expansions. These maps can be preordered from www.beziergames.com and will ship in October 2010. The &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; 7th map is only available through preorders. Expansion #1: California Gold Rush &amp; Underground Railroad as well as Expansion #2: Amazon Rainforest and Sahara Desert have been previously announced. Details about the remaining bonus pre-order only map will be coming in the next few weeks from Bezier Games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This first expansion for The Thing adds cards, a 5th &amp; 6th player, new Encounters, specific Blood Testing of other players, and other ways to expand your adventures in Antarctica circa 1982; cards like: &quot;I ain't going with Windows. I ain't going with him,&quot; &quot;And everybody watch whoever you're with - real close,&quot; The Thing on the Ceiling, &quot;If you are all these Things then you just attack me right now. So some of you are still human,&quot; and &quot; This Thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation.&quot; Also, a new mechanism has been added whereby up to 2 Outpost players that have been assimilated, may reveal their alien nature and actively work alongside the original Thing, against the remaining humans.&#10;&#10;The 5 and 6-player game plays slightly differently, in that the Thing player does not draw 5 or 6 cards per turn - she draws 3 cards, but has 3 new elements with which to thwart and upset the Outpost players:&#10;&#10;Bad Blood: Each turn, during the Blair-saucer phase, one player (chosen by the El Capitan) must put a card from their hand under the Bad Blood card. Failing to do so makes unpleasant things happen....&#10;&#10;Thousand Miles to the Coast Like the Blair-saucer, this is a play-area objective, giving the Thing another path to victory. If the players ignore for too long the lone dog's run for the coast, they may very well find that humanity is in deadly peril of being assimilated.&#10;&#10;Somebody blew a fuse in the lab: This can be a particularly harrowing encounter for the Outpost players, if they're not ready for it. During this stage of the game, infected-player-Things may have the opportunity to infect another Outpost player, unbeknownst to the others, while the lights are out...&#10;&#10;Due to the cost of printing the number of cards required for the base 2-4 player game, it was decided to release the additional player cards as a separate card expansion. Most of the cards can be added straight into the decks for 2-4 player games - with only a handful of cards designed specifically for 5-6 player games.&#10;&#10;Please note: This game is strictly for adults - with profanity and horrific imagery on many of the cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a non-replay game based loosely on the 400 Metres track event. Eight players each control a single runner on a staggered lane track - special rules apply for 4 to 7 players.&#10;&#10;Each runner has fifteen Bid Tokens, totalling 100 points of Stamina, and for each of the eight Turns a Movement Card is exposed to show the Movement permitted for the top bidder, the second highest bidder, and so on. One or more of the tokens are placed face down in front of the player and the bids examined when all players have made up their minds.&#10;&#10;The highest bid claims the first Movement shown on the card, the second highest the second, etc, etc. A Tie-Break Card quickly settles the matter between equal bids. The used Bid Tokens are discarded, except for the Zero token which is taken back into the hand (useful to bluff with!) and the next Turn takes place using a new Movement Card.&#10;&#10;Some Movement Cards give a significant Movement advantage to the top bidder, others may have the top three positions gaining equal Movement, but the lower bidders are at a definite disadvantage. All 27 Movement Cards are different (eight are dealt randomly for each race), so bidding tactics and bluffing vary with each race.&#10;&#10;Four Movement Cards are on display when the race starts, the one used for the first Turn plus the next three Turns, and at each Turn another Movement Card is revealed, so some forward planning is possible - and necessary! And the staggered lanes means that the true position of the runners is not known until they enter the home straight which deliberately adds to the uncertainty.&#10;&#10;If heats and/or semi-finals are run half of the unused Stamina can be carried forward to the next round or Final, and in any event unused Stamina can help a runner 'win' a photo finish if runners are level after eight Turns.&#10;&#10;Although designed as a multi-player game for eight players the game can be played by as few as four players with the special rules provided. It has excellent possibilities for Play-by-(e)Mail.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A semi-abstract, cooperative game designed to teach project management techniques.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on an 18x18 grid. The players take the role of project managers in a company. At the start of the game each player has a single project in play. Projects begin in a single space on the board, and each turn grow out one space orthogonally in all directions.  On a player's turn only his or her projects grow.&#10;&#10;If a project grows into the edge of the board, the game ends in a loss for all players.&#10;&#10;To finish projects, players utilize a mix of concept work and production work tokens. Placing a token on the board blocks projects from growing into that space.  If a project cannot grow it counts as finished, and the players score one point. After a project is completed, a replacement is added in a semi-random square.&#10;&#10;Concept work tokens are taken from a shared pool of 10, and once placed remain in play indefinitely.&#10;&#10;Additionally, each player has 2 production work tokens. These tokens only last for one round.&#10;&#10;A player's turn consists of doing one of the following: placing a single concept work token, moving a single concept work token, or placing both production work tokens.&#10;&#10;That player then grows his or her projects. If two (or more) projects collide they combine into a single compound project. Compound projects grow on the turns of every player who has a project involved, and their multiple growth points make them much harder to finish. Additionally, compound projects are still only worth a single point.&#10;&#10;The players win if they can finish eight projects. However, after every other project is finished, another project is added to the mix. This means that the end game requires managing seven projects simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Designed by a team at the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab for the MIT Sloan School of Management.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to engage and beat the opponent's squadron of fighters.&#10;&#10;This game is played on a three-dimensional gameboard of four levels.  Each level is 49 hexes.  One hex = 5000 km.  The levels are separated by a distance of 10,000 km.  By using the special four-sided die, you maneuver your fighters to engage the enemy without flying off the edge of the board - and out of the Altara system.&#10;&#10;Two or more players can play this game simultaneously, each being in command of a squadron of fighters.  A squadron may have one, two, three or four fighters.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each fighter has eight energy units.  Should the number drop to zero, the fighter is considered destroyed and must be taken out of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns, each one being made up of three phases:  Phase One - Movement, Phase Two - firing and Phase Three - damage assessment.&#10;&#10;The special die is rolled - player rolling highest chooses to move and fire first or last in the phases.  Damages are totaled and tallied on the score sheets. Movement can be done on the same level or the fighters may move up or down one level.  Attack strength is determined by distance to the target.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the last remaining fighter on the game board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'Blue Zone Hockey' is the third in our 5/6 System range of replay simulations, the others being 'The Beautiful Game' (soccer) and 'Rugby World'(Rugby Union), both available from www.owzatgames.com. It is also, incidentally, our first foray into the realms of North American sports, so it is with some trepidation that we launch this latest project, with phrases like 'bearding the lion in his own den'carrying coals to Newcastle' and, perhaps more appropriately, 'trying to sell ice to the Eskimos' springing to mind. But anyhow, despite what our great leaders tell us to the contrary (starting wars in other people's countries obviously excepted) life has to have some element of risk, so here goes.&#10;&#10;This is a case of the title saying it all. 'Blue Zone Hockey' concerns itself only with the action in and around the net, strictly blue zone only. We wanted a quick-playing simulation - you already have some great detailed hockey sims out there in the lions' den - but we also wanted to capture at least a little of the excitement of top-grade ice hockey so we have adapted the 5/6 System to produce a game that takes only 6-8 minutes to play an entire match but one which also provides some blue zone commentary, covers such aspects as sin-binning, Power Play, Short-Handed play, injuries, Overtime and Empty Net situations as well as suggesting ways to identify goal-scorers and assists and even goal times if you want that detail.&#10;&#10;What we don't provide are team and player details, you will need to do that for yourself. We have no intention of getting involved with the US/Canadian laws relating o the use of such information which, in this country thankfully, would be regarded as being 'in the Public Domain' and therefore not subject to the payment of Royalties. And long may it remain that way. We do explain, however, how you might go about all that.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb&#10;&#10;",

Kegeln is roughly the traditional German equivalent to Bowling. &#10;The game consists of a large tilted board with a frame on which nine pins can be placed. The players spin tops (two of different sizes are provided) to topple the pins. Because of the incline of the board, it is easy to miss the pins altogether; and toppling all nine with one strike can be achieved only after much practice&#10;&#10;You can play it in teams or free for all. Mespi has introduced 3 variants, small (= Mini), medium (= Tiroler Tischkegelspiel) and large (= Meraner Tischkegelspiel), all with similar rules.&#10;&#10;The game seems to have been produced since at least 1905 and well into the 1980s.&#10;&#10;These sort of table games were merely used in pubs (Bavaria, Tirol) during 19th century, often combined with (forbidden) wagering activities&#10;&#10;",

If the defending player fails to recite the requested verse, the requesting player draws a random card from the defending player's hand, discarding it if it is not the requested card.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who collects the most complete sets of four cards with the same topic.&#10;&#10;",

You try to remember, by gathering pieces of information and items in the facility, who you truly are and what's your purpose in the sanitarium. If you know who you are, then you have a purpose. If you fulfill your purpose, then you are the winner!

It's allows you to bluff, in being one of the roles that exist in the game, until another player proves you wrong. If no one can prove you wrong then you fulfill your role's objective. There are six different objectives in the game that depend on the player's adopted role.&#10;&#10;Sanitarium is best played with 3 to 6 players, but if you have a big group of friends it may be played with a maximum of 9 (if you don't bother with a little downtime, it repays in interactivity!).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are an Evil Lord in his Dark Throne in the Tower of Fear of his Castle of Skulls. Isn&rsquo;t it obvious what your aim is? You want to conquer the world by building some kind of Doomsday Device! In order to do so, you will have to give orders to your lowly Minions which will try to perform evil deeds, collect valuable resources, spread terror, fight heroes and cause general mayhem. Oh, another thing: there seem to be a few other Evil Lords around who are trying to conquer the world themselves: you will have to do it before them.&#10;&#10;Apart from your Dark Tower, there are 6 places in the Realm: the Countryside, the Wood, the Sanctuary, the City, the Castle and the Dungeon. There are 6 basic orders you could give to a Minion: Bring me some Gold, Bring me some Food, Bring me some Mana, attempt a Diplomacy Mission, attempt a War Mission, and Have some Fun. (Note that the Minion&rsquo;s concept of &quot;Diplomacy&quot; includes poisoning, forging, stealing and so on). &#10;Each turn you could give to a Minion just 1 of these 12 orders, thus selecting either what must he door where should him go, by means of placement on an apposite  board. &#10;For example, if you assign him the task of recovering some Gold, he will decide by himself if looking for it in the Dungeon or in the Sanctuary or elsewhere. &#10;On the other hand, if you order him to go to the Wood, it will be upon to him to decide either of having some Fun, or looking for Mana, or else.  &#10;The Minion will decide it by drawing an Evil Deed Card.&#10;&#10;There are all sort of Evil Deeds, ranging  from &quot;Poison the Good King in the Castle&quot; to &quot;Beat the Monks for Fun in the Sanctuary&quot;, an each will identify univocally both where the Minion will go and what will he try to do. &#10;The chance of actually being able to perform the Evil Deed will depend on chance (die roll), special ability of the Minion (such as &quot;Violence&quot;, &quot;Stealth&quot;, &quot;Persuasion&quot; and so on; each kind on Minion has his own) and on the nature of the Evil Deed. &#10;It could be that after the Evil Deed determination there are Minions of different Dark Lord in the same Place: in that case they will not tolerate the presence of the other(s) and they will fight until the other(s) will die. Also some Evil Deed Missions will involve a fighting with a Hero (randomly drawn from the Hero Deck). &#10;By performing Evil Deeds successfully you will be able to  collect basic resources (Gold, Food and Mana), Special Items (to increase the capabilities of your Minions), and components for your Doomsday devices.&#10;&#10;In addition, as you progress in your path of darkness, you will become both feared and hated by the Heroes of the Realm: while being feared is a good thing (Aid Minions in combat), since will aid your minions in combat situations, being hated too much could bring trouble, since will increase the probability of you being attacked by Heroes.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns playing cards from their hands on to their chains or the chains of their opponents. The chains must match both the color and position on the card. The basic set includes three colors and three possible positions. Players can also stop an opponent's chain from extending by playing an End Chain card which forces the player to play a different End Chain card to start their chain again. At then end of a round, scores are added up 1 pt for each card in the chain while deducting points for cards in their broken links pile.&#10;&#10;",

You know, of course, that people who build railroad companies are the most generous people in the world. They love to help out their competitors, with a motto of &ldquo;all for the greater good&rdquo; while having boatloads of fun. In this expansion, you&rsquo;ll share track with your opponents while they share track with you. And all it takes to share? A share!&#10;&#10;Yes, you&rsquo;re still competing with other players to move all the gifts everyone has gotten for each other to the correct party, but you&rsquo;re doing it with a wink of your eye and a fun little skip to your step. Sure, there&rsquo;s still only one winner, but it&rsquo;s really about how many friends you make while playing...and doesn&rsquo;t that make everyone a winner?&#10;&#10;Sharing is for 3 to 6 players who really care about other people.&#10;&#10;If you find the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; Sharing rules for Ted Alspach&rsquo;s Sharing Steam/Age of Steam expansion too competitive for your tastes, try this softer, more pleasant expansion map (on the reverse side of &ldquo;Sharing&rdquo;). You&rsquo;ll be guaranteed to make more friends in Steam/Age of Steam than ever before!&#10;&#10;What if Steam/Age of Steam was a truly cooperative game, like Shadows over Camelot with out a traitor? Or if no one had to die in Clue, so you could just mosey around that neat mansion talking to your friends? Or if there were no diseases in Pandemic, or no ghosts in Ghost Story? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun? Sure it would!&#10;Ted Alspach&rsquo;s *Really* Friendly Sharing is for 2 to 10 players who don&rsquo;t have some horribly recessive competitive gene.&#10;&#10;In Ted Alspach&rsquo;s *Really* Friendly Sharing, you work as a team to build a railroad. Many of the aspects that cause unnecessary tension in Age of Steam have been removed, like money and the AoS auction, so you can focus on laying track, making deliveries, getting VPs and having fun!&#10;&#10;The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 8 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double sided expansions. These maps can be preordered from www.beziergames.com and will ship in October 2010. The &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; Sharing map is only available through preorders. Expansion #1: California Gold Rush &amp; Underground Railroad, Expansion #2: Amazon Rainforest and Sahara Desert and Expansion #3: Atlantis and Trisland have been previously announced.&#10;&#10;",

If a player can claim groups of areas they will score more points.&#10;&#10;Players can also influence the hive by bidding on cards which give extra points, extra drone bees or more significantly the 'swarming' cards allow players to swap ownership of different areas of the hive.&#10;&#10;However at the end of a round the player with least points can remove a honey marker from the board and keep things balanced.&#10;&#10;Beehive was designed to be a quick fun game with a 'stop the leader' ethos in its design.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with Beehive&#10;&#10;",

The game can be played by two to four players each using one of the colors: blue, green, red, or yellow.  What is unique about this game are the playing pieces.  Each piece is about 1/2 inch in height and pieces are of various shapes.  If you look straight down on the pieces from above, the shapes are: square, triangle, circle, diamond, and octagon.  Furthermore, the square pieces come in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  In the basic game, only three of the shapes are used.  Many advanced variations exist, including one in which all the shapes are used.&#10;&#10;The game board has a series of tracks that lead from the start area to home.  Each piece must follow the track that matches its shape.  The square piece must follow the square track, the circular piece must follow the circular track and so on.  The tracks connect to each of the player's start areas to the central home area and hence intersect with each other.&#10;&#10;Certain points on the tracks and intersections allow players to jump their piece over other pieces or to bump opponents pieces back along their respective tracks.&#10;&#10;Finally, players can roll up to five dice (just once) to gain additional movement points.  Players must cover the numbers 1 to 6 with the five dice.  Two or more dice can be used to cover one number.  For example, on a roll of 1-2-2-3-6, the player could cover the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6.  In this example, 3 and 4 would be left uncovered, allowing the player to move pieces an additional seven spaces.&#10;&#10;The first player to move all of his pieces to home is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
