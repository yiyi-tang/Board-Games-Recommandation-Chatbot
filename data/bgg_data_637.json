    "Description": "Black SS is a book supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series, with 30 new scenarios by Mike Perryman depicting the actions of Waffen SS divisions in the last years of the Second World War. There are also 165 new die-cut and mounted playing pieces depicting all of the SS playing pieces found in Elsenborn Ridge, Road to Berlin and Beyond Normandy games with a black background requested by many fans, rather than the camouflage pattern used in those games.&#10;&#10;A note regarding the use of black to depict SS units; from the AP website:&#10;&#10;&quot;...many gamers have asked for them in that pattern, and my views have altered. For one thing, these are just little squares of colored, laminated cardboard. The black scheme has little to do with Nazi Germany; it's a game publishing idea. German situation maps made during the war do often use black ink for SS units (with blue for regular Army, red for enemies, green for allies). Otherwise, it's a tradition out of the dawn of wargaming. When we asked for feedback on new counter sets, the black SS units were far and away the leading choice.&#10;&#10;And so we have the Black SS set, 176 die-cut and mounted pieces in a new color scheme. It reproduces every SS unit and leader from three games: Elsenborn Ridge, Beyond Normandy and Road to Berlin. If you don't like the black scheme, you don't need them. If you like it and want to see the SS get crushed in the most visible form possible, it just plugs right in. It's an extra, and a fairly inexpensive one at $9.99.&quot;&#10;&#10;Read the full article here: http://www.avalanchepress.com/Black_SS_Pieces.php&#10;&#10;",

Just like the commanders in the core set, these new commanders have specific strengths (and weaknesses). For example, Sandor &ldquo;the Hound&rdquo; Clegane uses the new fearsome keyword, refusing to let his enemies disengage and forcing them to retreat two hexes for each morale result rolled in combat.&#10;&#10;In addition to commanders, Wardens of the West also introduces three all-new unit types of Lannister affiliation. The House Brax pikemen specialize in formations, while the Clegane crossbowmen utilize the new aimed shot keyword. The Westerlands militia are easy to break and lack formal military training, but they make up for it in their vast numbers.&#10;&#10;Wardens of the West adds more than 30 new plastic miniatures and over 30 new cards. It also includes a Rules and Battle Plans book as well as more terrain overlays, banners, and tokens. Additionally, Wardens of the West also introduces new game mechanics, such as the new Gambit cards, formations, and the deadly catapults!&#10;&#10;",

Each player has eight pieces: six &quot;Bauern&quot; (Peasants), one &quot;Ritter&quot; (Knight) and one &quot;Dame&quot; (Lady).&#10;&#10;Initial Set-up&#10;&#10;White:&#10;Dame e1; Ritter c1; Bauern a1, b2, d2, f2, g1, h2.&#10;&#10;Black:&#10;Dame d8, Ritter f8, Bauern a7, b8, c7, e7, g7, h8.&#10;&#10;The Peasants move like Draughts men.&#10;&#10;The Kinghts move like the Bishop in Chess.&#10;&#10;The Lady moves like the King of American Straight Checker/English Draughts.&#10;&#10;A Peasant is promoted to a Knight when it reaches the last file.&#10;&#10;Capture is by replacement (as in Chess).&#10;&#10;The object is to mate the opponent's Lady.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The heroes and villains who populate the world of Granton City Press will soon be population a new table top miniatures game.&#10;&#10;An agreement has been reached with Rattrap Productions LLC to bring the Granton City world to the games table with the fall release of &lsquo;While the City Sleeps: A Game of Heroic Action in Granton City&rsquo;&#10;&#10;While the City Sleeps is a fast-paced tabletop miniatures game of heroic combat set in the world of Granton City. Players control the actions of heroic crimefighters or nefarious villains and their henchmen. Each player will have anywhere from 1 to a dozen models whose actions they determine.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast and deadly. Using the results of two six-sided dice, players try and fight through the defenses of their opponents. Heroes and Major villains can withstand punishment but their henchman will be falling left and right to slugs, knives and fists.&#10;&#10;All characters are pre-generated so players will be ready to go straight from the book. Special abilities will give the major characters an edge over those around them, but even the greatest hero can fall to the villain's henchmen if he is unsupported.&#10;&#10;Two experienced players will be able to play out their favorite action from the world of Granton City in about 2 hours on a game space no bigger than a dining room table.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;When approached about incorporating the diverse characters from Granton City Press into a table top miniatures game, I thought it was a great idea,&rdquo; said Richard A. Johnson the man behind Rattrap Productions LLC. &ldquo;Initially we tossed around the idea of incorporating the characters into one of our existing games but came to realize there was enough unique and interesting new character in Granton City to support a new game themselves.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Johnson said he had been working on a new game, and it turned out to be a perfect vehicle for characters such as The Black Wolf, The Starling, Ghost Wind and Churchill: Alien Bounty Hunter.    &#10;    &#10;The new game will be an ideal place for the soon to be released Black Wolf miniature from Zombiesmith Miniatures. Watch for more news on the miniature front in the weeks ahead.    Granton City Press expects to have The Black Wolf #1: Metal Monsters of Doom out in April. Black Wolf #2, and spin-off titles Unit 13, Ghost Win and Churchill: Alien Bounty Hunter follow in the fall, with a release expected to coincide closely with Rattrap&rsquo;s release of While the City Sleeps.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Wikipedia:&#10;&#10;Forty-Fives (also known as Forty-Five, Forte Fives, Auction Forty-Fives, Auction 120s, 120, Growl, Spoil Five, Maw and Strong Fives) is a trick-taking card game that is played in Ireland, and in some parts of New England, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia where it is known as Forte Fives. It is closely related to the game One-hundred and ten (110) also described below.&#10;&#10;The game may have got its name from &quot;forte&quot; which is Latin for strong which describes the 5's in the deck. The origin of this game is thought to be Ireland.[citation needed] In the 1920s, the game became Forte Fives when it moved South into the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts and New Hampshire with French Canadian immigrants. Today, Forty-fives continues to be very popular in the Merrimack Valley. It is played with a standard deck of 52 cards (sometimes with jokers).&#10;&#10;&#10;Taken from the Article: 45s - Merrimack Valley&rsquo;s Original Card Game - as published in Merrimack Valley Magazine:&#10;&#10;***&#10;&#10;So much about the card game forty-fives doesn&rsquo;t add up.&#10;&#10;If in the right suit, the 5 is the best card, a jack beats a king, and a 2 can be better than a 10 &hellip; but only when it wears black. For the uninitiated, it just gets more confusing from there.&#10;&#10;Even the name of the game is ambiguous. Some say the name forty-fives refers to the four 5s in the deck, others say it has to do with a Canadian version of the game, in which the goal is to reach 45 points (the Canadians call our version &ldquo;120&rdquo;). Then there&rsquo;s the theory that forty-fives is derived from &ldquo;forte&rdquo; &mdash; meaning strong &mdash; the 5 being the &ldquo;mightiest&rdquo; card. And is it written &ldquo;45s,&rdquo; or &ldquo;forty-fives&rdquo;?&#10;&#10;Through all the confusion, however, it all makes sense to legions of forty-fives players around the Merrimack Valley. A game rooted in 19th century Ireland, forty-fives is as popular as ever across the Valley in 2012, whether it&rsquo;s played for fun, in a league, at a fundraiser or even on a computer.&#10;&#10;The following rules summary was taken from www.the45scardgame.com &#10;&#10;Rules (Merrimack Valley Style)&#10;&#10;Objective: Partners try to win tricks and prevent their opponents from doing so. The first team to reach 120 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Scoring: Each trick counts for 5 points, and the highest trump in play is an additional 5. After the hand, each team counts what they have taken. If the bidder's team has taken at least the amount of their bid, they score all they have won. If this team fails, the amount of their bid is deducted from their score. The other team in either case always scores what it has won in tricks.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game: The team to first reach a total of 120 points wins the game. If both teams reach 120 in the same hand, the bidding team wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players: This game can be played with anywhere from 2 to 10 players, but in this version it's 2 vs. 2 (partners).&#10;&#10;Cards: A regular deck of 52. The highest trump is the 5, then the Jack, then and Ace of Hearts (no matter what suit is trump). After that it goes Ace of suit, King, Queen, and then it black it goes 2 through 10 and in red 10 through 2 (both&#10;cases skipping the 5).&#10;&#10;The Full rank in the trump suit is the following; &#10;From highest to lowest:&#10;&#10;Hearts:&#10;5, J, A, K, Q, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2&#10;&#10;Diamonds:&#10;5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2&#10;&#10;Clubs:&#10;5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#10;&#10;Spades:&#10;5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#10;&#10;The Full rank in off suit is as follows: (the Ace of Hearts is not shown since it is always a trump and always the third highest card);&#10;&#10;From highest to lowest:&#10;&#10;Hearts:&#10;K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2&#10;&#10;Diamonds:&#10;K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A&#10;&#10;Clubs:&#10;K, Q, J, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#10;&#10;Spades:&#10;K, Q, J, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#10; Dealing: Each player is dealt 5 cards in batches of 3 then 2. After the initial 3 cards to each player, 3 are dealt to a kitty followed by 2 more to each player.&#10;&#10;Bidding: The bidding starts with the player to the left of the deal and continues clockwise. Each player in turn may either &#10;bid or pass. Bids are made in multiples of 5 up to 30, with the minimum opening bid being 15. No suit is mentioned during &#10;the bidding process until all bids have been made. The highest bidder names the trump suit.&#10;&#10;Drawing: Each player discards as many cards (up to 4) as he wishes from his hand. The dealer then restores each player's&#10;hand to 5 cards, starting with the player to his left. Cards are dealt all at once to each player (no 3-2 method).&#10;&#10;Playing: The bidder makes the opening lead. The hand is played out in 5 tricks. If a trump is lead and you have any trump &#10;cards, you must follow suit.* If an off-suit card is led, any card may be played. A trick is won by the highest trump or the highest card of the suit led if no trump are played.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Reneging exception: The three highest trumps (5, J, Ace of Hearts) have the privilege of reneging when a lower trump is led. For example, if the trump 6 is led, a player holding any of these three top trumps without lower trumps may throw off-suit instead of following suit (if he has lower trump also, then he must play a trump). But there is no reneging a higher trump. For example, if the trump Jack is played, the holder of the 5 may renege, but not the holder of the Ace of Hearts.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As chess evolved from shatranj in the West, pieces gained power by becoming long-range sliders, producing an abstract game where most pieces can cross an open board in a single turn. Eastern variants stay closer to the beginnings of the game, which featured a number of short-range sliders and leapers, but the power pieces still seem to be long-range. What if long-range pieces did not come to be so dominant? Suppose the short-range pieces of chess' infancy became more powerful by gaining additional short-range moves? Great Shatranj examines some potentials of these pieces, offering 5 different pieces that slide 1 square or jump 2 squares. Each player has up to 8 leapers on the board, giving the game a noticeably different flavor.&#10;&#10;The game is played on an 8x10 board and is played with standard chess rules, except as modified by the specific piece movement rules. Great Shatranj is a short-range Capablanca [actually Carrera] Chess variant. Kings, knights and pawns are the usual pieces, but bishops, rooks and all the pieces that use them as components have been replaced by analogs that step 1 square or leap 2 squares, only, in the bishop or rook directions. This is the second game in a series of shatranj variants offering an alternate history for chess. It may be played with a standard 8x10 Capablanca Chess set.&#10;&#10;http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSgreatshatranjm&#10;&#10;",

A Grand Chess set may be used to play. This game uses the pasha, a piece that steps 1 square or leaps 2 squares in a straight line, and introduces 2 apparently new variant chess pieces, the oliphant and lightning warmachine, bishop and rook analogs which step 1 square or leap 2 squares, then may step 1 or leap 2 again. No piece moves more than 4 squares, but pawn walls lose effectiveness. The game plays rather differently than its namesake, and is the third in a series of shatranj variants.&#10;&#10;",

But it is never so simple, as important senators do not accept but important titles. All the titles provide direct victory points, new tribunes and a special power that sets off when attached to a Senator.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game each player scores their majorities in the Senate and lose victory points for each Senator of their own without an attached title.&#10;&#10;The auction process includes the possibility to play veto cards, that will deeply change the outcome not only of the auction but also of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The player whose end of the seesaw goes down first wins. In the second version the players first roll a die and then decide which animal to take, thus they need to assess when to use the heavier animals and when to use the smaller. The third and most advanced rules state that the winning condition is for the other players seesaw to be the heaviest (ie. the lighter side wins), making the game more strategic and suitable for older children.&#10;&#10;",

The number values are all from 1 to 3.&#10;&#10;After all the players have played their cards they must choose a plot to perform. They all have 6 plot cards to play, and every turn they play one and get a new one from the deck.

    "Description": "Dice-and-chart simulation game of the 100 meter dash.  The original edition includes 50 of the all-time great runners and is supplemented by a 2008 Beijing Olympics edition adding 12 more runners, for a total of 62 current and all-time great runners.  Runners include all men's Olympic champions from Charley Paddock in 1920 to Usain Bolt in 2008.  Game includes factors such as fitness, injuries, false starts, weather.  Timing options enables comparison to world records.&#10;&#10;Each race consists of a series of six die rolls for each runner, building on the success (or lack thereof) on each of the prior rolls.  Each runner has a separate rating for the start, 10-30 meters, 30-50 meters, 50-70 meters, 70-90 meters, and the finish, as well as injuries, form, false starts.  Approximately 30 different venues, rated for speed (fast, slow, medium), are included, as are options for a campaign game.&#10;&#10;This is strictly a sports replay simulation game, with no strategy options other than runner and course selection.  Game is published by Owzat Games under license from Lambourne Games.&#10;&#10;Another description:&#10;&#10;At first glance the 100 Metres track event may seem an odd choice for a sports replay game. Around 10 seconds of explosive action, nothing in the way of in-race tactics (if you discount the physiological warfare that takes place as the runners line up and get to their marks, more akin to two boxers eyeballing each other before a fight than to an athletics meeting), no 'decisions' for the replay gamer to make, just pure unleashed speed from starting blocks to tape. But an athletics sprinting coach will tell you differently.&#10;&#10;Each part of the race, and the training manuals usually divide the 100 Metres into four distinct sections, Start, Pick-Up, Acceleration and Maximum Speed, require varying disciplines and techniques, and world-class sprinters all have their strengths and weaknesses, so this is what we have tried to focus on in this simulation, hopefully bringing to life the running characters of some of the All-Time-Great sprinters of the last hundred years. We have extended the training manual concept of four different sections into six, taking the runners progressively to 10m, 30m, 50m, 70m, 90m and 100m and within those six Sections each athlete's ability will vary to re-create his running style. And ability too, we hope. And here we must insert a caveat. In athletics to a degree not applicable to other timed sports performances have improved dramatically as training methods, diets and track surfaces have evolved and here we are trying to compare Charles Paddock with Maurice Green, Jesse Owens with Donovan Bailey.&#10;&#10;To make this simulation 'work' we have had to use a benchmark, time wise, and up-grade the performances of athletes from earlier era to this level of performance. Because we felt that users would want to be able to get close to the current World Record (in the right circumstances with the right athletes) we have geared the simulation to 2001 season performances, assuming in doing so that the great sprinters of the past would have travelled that much quicker with all the (legal) advantages that their contemporary 'rivals' enjoy today. At the end of the day, of course, it is our judgement in all such matters, you may well disagree with that, and we can only say in our defence that we have been as objective as possible after lengthy and detailed research.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Damned Hot Work is a miniatures wargaming system primarily designed for 25/28mm models, and is a fast and simple game that should allow large battles to be fought easily in one evening - or a couple of skirmishes - recreating the drama of combat with dice rolls and a deck of cards.&#10;&#10;This is a wargame heavily dependant on a glorious theme - it's actually buried miles deep beneath the Earth's crust in theme! Fight melees between British regiments of Foot, coal-fired robots, fez-wearing villains, snarling, leaping mummies, knife-twirling Chinese warriors, hordes of spear-chucking natives, ferocious African-like wildlife, ravenous dinosaurs, mad scientists, vampire lords, and rifle-wielding Zikhs; or any bizarre combination that tickles your fancy.&#10;&#10;DHW is set in a romantic fictional universe, half a world away and over a century ago. Most battles and skirmishes take place in the hot, mountainous country of Quarajanistan. Though bloodthirsty action has also been spied on the dinosaur-infested Namajaro Plateau, in the steaming jungles and Lost Valley of the Baka-Mang, and the deadly, secret Kingdom of the Kuji-Gani.&#10;&#10;The game is based loosely on the well-known wars of British Colonialism: Northern India, the Zulu War, the Boer War, the Egyptian and Sudanese campaigns, but also includes many fantastical elements. In the world of DHW, it is not uncommon to spy an armoured airship, coal-fired borrowing contraption, Martian Tripod, steam-powered tank, or even lancers on unicycles!  During the course of play, expect to encounter heinous villains, angry creatures, fearsome monsters - and the worst monsters of all: true-blooded Englishmen. Play may be accompanied by a stiff brandy and cigars.&#10;&#10;Inspired by books and films such as The Lost World, War of the Worlds, The Mummy, Zulu, Zulu Dawn, Master of the World, At the Earth&rsquo;s Core, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Valley of the Gwangi, and many others, DHW is a light wargame.&#10;&#10;An often-cited shortfall of wargaming design, is that the player who rolls better dice than their opponent will always win. This is generally true, and some would say this reflects the chaos of battle and the vagaries of command. Damned Hot Work addresses this issue with Feather Tokens, gifted to each player whenever they fail certain die rolls. These tokens can be spent in multiples of four on later turns to buy instant-kills, or succeed morale checks, or move a unit more aggressively.&#10;&#10;",

The rules use the WITP counters and combat results use the original WITP tables.  Gunfire combat is simultaneous and accounts for target size and speed, gun range (by ship type), and facing. Command control and fog of war are covered as well, so the rules can deal with both day and night combat.&#10;&#10;The rules come with no less than eight separate scenarios covering major engagements of the Pacific War so they can be played even outside a WITP game: Java Sea, Savo Island, Cape Esperance, Guadalcanal I &amp; II, Tassafaronga, and the Komandorski Islands.&#10;&#10;Published in Chain_of_Command issue 2.&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the introduction:)&#10;&#10;The mechanics of surface combat in the original War in the Pacific have nothing whatever to do with the actual operation of modern warships. [...]&#10;&#10;This alternative set of rules has been designed to impart some of the tactical flavor of WWII naval combat.  At the same time, an effort was made to keep the complexity ot a reasonable minimum.  [...] With practice, it is hoped that it will not take any more time than the routine it replaces.&#10;&#10;These rules will rectify a few of the inconsistencies in War in the Pacific. They will introduce the players to the awesome Japanese Long Lance torpedo. [...]  In addition certain ship types will be restored to usefulness, such as Japanese CL's.&#10;&#10;I hope this effort adds to your appreciation and enjoyment of SPI's classic monstergame.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to be the last character standing in the saloon.&#10;&#10;Players take turns attacking each other as the game proceeds. A punch, for instance, will injure the target on a d6 roll of 5+, while a kick will injure the target on a roll of 4+.

If they are injured twice (before being healed), then they are knocked out.&#10;&#10;A KO'd character falls to the floor (i.e. they push their character card into the center of the table).

    "Description": "The SHIP Card Games are easy-to-learn and start having Fun fast.  Space N Time uses a sci-fi theme but, enjoyment of SNT goes way beyond the sci-fi niche.  The Object is to collect Cards &amp; match &lsquo;sets&rsquo; for points. Each Player starts with 6 Cards. A Players &ldquo;turn&rdquo; is called a Time Loop &ndash; which consists of 3 Steps: 1) Turn in &lsquo;sets&rsquo; of Cards (example: 3 Shuttle Cards = 5 pts.), 2) Attack another Player (optional), 3) Draw two Cards from the Deck. You do not have to do Steps 1 &amp; 2 but, drawing your two Cards officially ends your Loop.  Players have an option to Attack any other Player, following the Card Rank, to gain Cards or get rid of unwanted Cards.  Game play can go to a point threshold like 100 points or Players can just keep track of &ldquo;wins&rdquo; &amp; play to 5 or 10 &ldquo;wins&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;There are no &quot;histories to learn&quot; or magic spells to keep track of.  The basic nature of SHIP Card Games is not complicated (&ldquo;Fun for all ages&rdquo;), but there are subtleties and nuances that provide a challenge and sophistication that&rsquo;s not initially apparent.  In addition, BONUS OPTIONS add a strategic vector and extends the Game.  The SHIP Card Games can be easy going or get fast paced when you and you're friends are 'into it'.  Games can last for minutes or hours.  Combine multiple Decks and you can have as many people in a Game as you like and play longer Games.  DON&rsquo;T FORGET, you can also play SOLO, the solitaire version!&#10;&#10;As you get to know the SHIP Card Games, you'll discover many nuances and preferences. There are strategies concerning: turning in 'sets', Battling, when to 'retire' a Generation, ending the Game and others. Games can be played to: a point threshold like 100 points, the 1st Player to get 10 &quot;wins&quot;, the 1st Player to get 10 Starships, the 1st Player to 'retire' their last Generation, and more. You can also play SOLO, the solitaire version - which has BONUS OPTIONS, too.&#10;&#10;",

Take on a hilarious hit parade of musical trivia and tasks and reach the Final Countdown before the other team beats you to it!&#10;&#10;Setting Up:&#10;First, players must split up into two teams. Teams may consist of as many players as you like but must have at least two players in each. Position the game board where all players can reach it.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;Each space on the board corresponds to a question category (see: Categories) and states whether the opposing team asks the playing team a question or ifthe playing team chooses one of it's own members to ask their remaining team mates. Used cards are returned to the bottom of the deck.&#10;&#10;Play moves in a clockwise around the board, one space at a time. For each correct answer, a team may move forward one space and answer the next question, up to a total of three spaces in one turn. A team's turn is over if they correctly answer three questions in a row, or if they answer a question incorrectly.&#10;&#10;If a team fails to correctly answer a question asked by one of their own teammates, the opposing team answers correctly, they move the playing team back one space on the board. Play continues as normal.&#10;&#10;If a team is stalled on a certain category and answers incorrectly three turns in a row, they automatically proceed to the next space on the board at the start of their next turn.&#10;&#10;Cards:&#10;There are five types of cards that correspond to the coloured spaces on the game board.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;The first team to make to the finish space wins the game.&#10;&#10;Categories:&#10;&#10;Know Your Product:&#10;The opposing team reads out the four different choices of genre.

The other team mates must guess the correct answer from the picture.&#10;Note: You can't include letters or numbers in your drawing!&#10;&#10;Mondegreens:&#10;A player from your team reads out the misinterpreted song lyrics on the question card. The other team mates must guess the song title.&#10;&#10;Word Up:&#10;A player from your team reads out the random words on the question card. The other team mates must guess the song title.&#10;&#10;Musician or Serial Killer:&#10;The opposing team reads out the name from the question card. The playing team must then guess if the person is a musician or a serial killer&#10;&#10;Cover or Original:&#10;The opposing team reads out a song title and artist. The playing team must decide whether that song was an original or a cover version of another artist's song.&#10;&#10;Common People:&#10;The opposing team reads out the names of three musicians. The playing team must identify what the three musicians have in common.&#10;&#10;Two Little Words:&#10;A player from your team looks at the name of a musician on the question card and then says two single-word clues to their team mates (the words in the musicians name are not permitted). The other team mates must guess the musician.&#10;&#10;Substitue:&#10;A player fromyour team sings a song from the question card, substituting the lyrics of the song with words from a book, magazine or from the games rules. The other team mates must guess the song title.&#10;&#10;Final Countdown:&#10;A player from your team asks the other team mates a music trivia question. If the playing team answers the question correctly the move to the Finish space and win the game!&#10;&#10;taken from the rule book of the game&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Greenline is a roll and move game that represents the moving of the resources of a large corporation around the world. Players compete to get to the end of the board first...&#10;&#10;However, unlike a simple roll and move game, there are some interesting wrinkles. Each player uses a different mode of transport: airplane, train, truck, or boat. Each mode allows a player to avoid a hazard or gain an advantage in a particular situation that may or may not come up during any particular session. At the beginning of the game, the player who rolls highest gets to choose their mode of transport, followed by the next highest rolling player, etc. Each mode uses a different color pawn.&#10;&#10;Also, players have the option of rolling for one of 5 special attributes at the beginning of the game. These attributes - 1. invoice, 2. letter of credit, 3. customs documents, 4. freight insurance, &amp; 5. the goods... are not exclusive to any one player and are randomly determined. A player may roll as many times as they like for these attributes (which can potentially prevent setbacks or lend an advantage), but once they've started moving on the board, they are not allowed to roll for any more attributes. Players must balance a desire for having as many attributes as possible with the notion of getting moving on the board.&#10;&#10;The main path on the board (also the shortest path) is the Greenline of the title. However, if players land on certain squares they must roll a die to see if they are diverted onto a red circuit. This creates a delay as the player must go through a side path that usually has other negative encounter possibilities. There are also a number of yellow spaces on the board that represent random challenges which require the player to have one of the special attributes to avoid a penalty or to gain an advantage.&#10;&#10;This game appears to have been developed by Philips to build teamwork or to encourage employees to think in terms of working as efficiently as possible. Apparently this game only appeared in Dutch.&#10;&#10;",

Each card represents an AFV (armored fighting vehicle) type and has counter marker tracks for up to a platoon of such vehicles.  Markers for armor leaders, malfunctions and special equipment could thus be off board, allowing for less clutter on the mapboard units.&#10;&#10;Common in miniature game systems, vehicle tracking cards in ASL first appeared for German and Soviet forces in Streets of Fire: ASL Deluxe Module 1 and then for American  forces in Hedgerow Hell: ASL Deluxe Module 2, both encouraging the use of 1/285th scale armor miniatures as mapboard units.&#10;&#10;Use of the cards does not impact the AFV rule set, it is simply a record keeping enhancement.  In particular, these cards are not meant to provide a means of hidden information, as the rules specifically require the AFV status to be displayed at all times to the opponent.  Thus, for example, hidden armor leaders are still be noted somewhere off of the cards.&#10;&#10;Page F18 of Chapter F provided in West of Alamein: ASL Module 5 stated: &quot;British AFV Cards will become available for purchase as of January 1989.  Their cost will be $5.00 US, plus 10% for shipping within the USA (or for APO/FPO); or 20% for Canada or Mexico; or 30% for shipment overseas.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Here they are again mixed up so the player doesn't know which tile is where. Based on what they saw in their sneak peak players make a bid as to how many points they believe they'll earn throughout the course of the round. Each player then blindly turns over one of his or her tiles and the highest number played takes that turn.&#10;&#10;After all tiles have been played, the points are tabulated to see how each player did in relation to his or her bid. After a round of play, players may find their score increased or decreased. They may earn either the number of points taken in or the number of points taken in plus the amount of their bid. Or, if they are unlucky and do not make the amount of their bid, will find their overall score decreased by the amount of their bid. Play continues round by round until one player has earned 10,000 points.&#10;&#10;above info from side of tin.&#10;&#10;",
