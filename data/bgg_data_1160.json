Each round, one player (called the Traveler) secretly takes a Destination card which indicates where they're going. The other players have a predetermined number of Question Actions denoted by chips, and in the center of the table a pile of Item Tiles, all unique. All at the same time, the players who are not the Traveler sift through the Items, trying to pick the very best set of four for the Traveler to take with them. Meanwhile, the players may cash in chips to ask limited Questions that will narrow down where the Traveler is going.&#10;&#10;Once all of the Question Actions have been taken (all the chips spent), the Traveler reveals their Destination and all players reveal the Items they selected. Then everyone gets a chance to tell a story to justify why they picked what they did. The Traveler chooses who &quot;packed&quot; the set of items and declares that player the winner for the round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once they are farting, they are won&rsquo;t be movable for the remainder of the game. Cows can also take up more of the usable terrain space by farting, so time those gaseous releases appropriately. The game ends after any player places their last terrain card on the table, with one final turn for each other player.

Main mechanics which make up the unique and challenging experience of Autarch include:&#10;&#10;     Initiative Dial mechanism creates a dynamic player order, depending on the played cards;&#10;     Threat Level defines how much each fighter is worth in every attack, making it less opportunistic to focus on the weaker ones;&#10;     Dice-replacement Power deck represents effort a player is willing to invest in all of his actions.

Count cards and strategize, push junk onto other robots, or just blow up the pile entirely.

Each player chooses a robot which has a 12 card deck associated with it. Each deck is identical except for one card unique to that robot. Players set up by placing four cards in their Extra Stack (cards in the Extra Stack will be added to a players hand later in the round), one card in the Collection (a shared pool of hidden cards that players don't need to get rid of), and the rest of the cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of players taking turns playing cards into a pile in the center of the play area, or, if they cannot play a card, picking up the pile and adding the cards into their hand. Each card has an ability that might do things like blow up the pile, skip player's turns, or tamper with cards in the collection.&#10;&#10;Players who get rid of all of their cards earn victory credits. The first robot to receive six is crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player has 4 word cards, each with 4 words on it and each word 5 letters long. However, each word is an English word spelled out phonetically. On a player's turn they play one of their words out to the board using the letter tiles, similar to Scrabble except players have access to all letters at all times. Once a word is played all other players can make 3 guesses among them what they think the words actually is. If they fail to say the word correctly, the current player earns an additional 10 points. Regardless, players earn points when placing words based on the squares on the board they lay their words. After four rounds, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This is game #5 of a series from Things Unlimited.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Expansion:&#10;&#10;&quot;One of 3rd FLEET's limitations as a game is a shortage of scenarios. Other tactical/operational wargames overcome such a shortcoming by offering a system for designing your own(DYO) scenarios. But, for that one needs some manner in which to compare the units of the game. The following is an approximate valuation for each unit in 3rd FLEET based upon relative &quot;combat power&quot;, allowing players to customize their own fleets for additional scenarios.&#10;&#10;These &quot;purchase points&quot; are given per-unit; the number in parentheses is the number of such counters provided in the game's countermix. If nuclear weapons are to be used, pay the&#10;cost to the right of the slash mark. Players may also purchase damaged units at half-cost. Each player may purchase mines for placement before the start of the match for five points each.&#10;&#10;Before the game, the opposing players should agree upon the purchase level for each side, with each side getting the same number of points to work with. Roughly speaking, use 400-1000 points per side for a low-complexity scenario; 1000-3000 points for a scenario of medium length/complexity; and 4000+ points for an advanced scenario. A detailed breakdown of the point values of existing scenarios is provided for comparison purposes in the first sidebar.&quot;&#10;&#10;It also provides for the following four new scenarios, complete with Special Rules, Game Length, Victory Conditions, and detailed Deployment:&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre!&#10;Melee in the Caribbean&#10;Assault on Jamaica&#10;Red SeaLion&#10;&#10;This expansion was first published as an article in The General, Vol. 27, No. 2 (1991).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The one feature that contributes most to 2nd FLEET's attractiveness as a game of strategy is its excellent playability. The sub-systems work very well together, and play flows smoothly even in the Advanced Game. The optional Logistics rules are the worst impediment to playability, but even these manifest themselves only at the end of every third turn; experienced, well-organized players can cope with these&#10;readily enough.&#10;&#10;As with all &quot;modem&quot; wargames dealing with hypothetical conflict, 2nd FLEET shares the problem that it must amount to an &quot;educated guess&quot;. There is no history against which its accuracy can be closely measured (the recent Gulf War notwithstanding). This situation is especially acute for naval games, as there has yet to be a conflict encompassing all the elements embraced by the FLEET series. For example, although guided missiles, airpower, submarines and surface vessels all took part in the Falklands War, there was no simultaneous use of all four elements of naval power in a coordinated manner by both sides in any single engagement. If 2nd FLEET must be an educated guess, however, then it is a very educated one. Another expert might argue with Joe Balkoski's systemic forecast of modem naval warfare, but until the awful day that the real world provides a real standard to judge by, 2nd FLEET's accuracy stands to be as good as that of any other game on the subject.&#10;&#10;There are some areas in which players can afford to experiment with the rules, however. One lies in force deployment. The Readiness Level selected for the Advanced Game scenarios and subsequent die rolls for reinforcement can accelerate or decelerate the arrival of units, but the general pattern of disposition remains the same. As warships and air units can move faster than the political events leading to a superpower conflict, this pattern should not be viewed as rigidly unalterable.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The expansion provides variants focusing on deployment options for NATO and the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Unlike Soviet-built tanks and aircraft, no Russian first-line submarine has ever been exported to an ally - so no one has ever been captured and analyzed by the Western Powers. And since no Soviet nuclear sub has ever fired a shot in anger, their weapon systems have never been observed under combat&#10;conditions. These factors combine to make anyone's conclusions about the capabilities of Russian submarines subject to considerable debate. Here is an attempt to inflict mine upon the FLEET system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;This provides an in-depth look at Soviet submarine capabilities within the FLEET Series, including deep-diving ability, double hulls, titanium hulls, clusterguard, torpedo factors, movement allowance and charts to provide easy to find details.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the start of a project, the first two questions a wargame designer asks himself are: what is the area I wish to in the game, and at what scale do I show it? 2nd FLEET, which is a follow-on game to the successful 6th FLEET, was irrevocably tied to the scale of its older cousin (roughly 50 miles per hex). The emphasis of the new game is on carrier operations in the Norwegian Sea; the two maps used in the game are centered on the North Atlantic, from Greenland to Norway (on an east-west axis) and from the Kola Peninsula to the northern tip of Ireland (on a south-north axis). Even using two maps, the &quot;southern approaches&quot; to the British Isles (that is, the sea route skirting the southern Irish coast) had to be omitted from the game due to space constraints. Since an important part of the simulation deals with the movement of convoys from the United States and Canada to Europe, the realism of 2nd FLEET can be enhanced if the NATO player is permitted to use the slower but safer southern approach to Europe for his convoys.&#10;&#10;Using the expansion map, counters and rules included in this article, 2nd FLEET players will have more maneuver room for their surface and submarine units. (But unfortunately, will have less maneuver room on their dining room tables!) As a result, both players' strategic options will be increased. Moreover, each side will have more units to play with. since the addition of the southern approaches will also add some naval forces that had been omitted from the original game-most importantly, the powerful French Atlantic squadron.&#10;&#10;The expansion was included in Avalon Hill's in-house published magazine the &quot;General&quot; in Volume 25, Issue 1 (their 25th anniversary issue).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to win employee of the minute, by filling all of your your seven tea cups before anyone else finishes filling theirs. Complicating the situation a little is the fact that not only are players filling their own cups, they&rsquo;re also spilling their opponents cups at the same time.&#10;&#10;The game cleverly employs the stroop effect to test players' deciphering abilities and reaction times. Insani-tea is  inevitable and that's a big part of the fun. The cute boba ball theme and the delightfully simple game play make this game accessible to most anyone who isn't afraid to rub elbows at the table.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to become the Boba Boss?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Empress is a world of exotic steam and punk in which a one-eyed despot rules supreme. It is a world of indentured peons and hardworking mules, traveling tinker bands and perspiring fixers bathed in furnace glow. Merchantmen anchor off far-flung ports while rank upon rank of Her Majesty's rifles assemble in faceless obedience. A darkened corner could turn up one of Turing's programmatic spies while, ensconced underground, seers break through into a kaleidoscope of forbidden futures. Here, there are dukes (one mad), princelings with dark pasts and kings and queens of uncertain allegiance. Overhead, her Highness's trusted fighting aces rule the skies; beneath, her elephantine automatons shake the very ground.&#10;&#10;In this realm, the all-seeing, all-knowing tentacles of the Great Empress reach far and wide. So wide, in fact, that many have despaired of freedom and&mdash;at a glance of her one baleful eye&mdash;life itself. But there is hope: a tale overheard in the fevered ruminations of a nameless prophet speaks of a day when one of her subjects will approach the throne, wrench the cephalopodic scepter from her grasp and end the reign of terror. But who?&#10;&#10;Welcome to Empress, a climbing game of cunning, strategy and power. The premise? Be the first to shed all of your cards and ascend the throne of the Great Empress. But beware&mdash;a tragic misstep and you could find yourself wallowing in drudgery as a Peon or Mule. Empress may be played with any number of players from 2 to 8 (add a second deck for 5 or more).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A wargame played on a square grid using square cardboard tokens for representing military units. It was played around 1809-1820 at the Plebanischen Institute in Wien and was probably designed by a teacher or student(s) there. The rules were written down by an Austrian army officer A.P Reyer and published under the name &quot;Ein Altes Kriegsspiel&quot; (that translates to &quot;An Old Wargame&quot;) in 1858. The rulebook also contains drawings showing an example game board and images that can be used for painting the units, although they are not to scale or complete, so players are expected to construct their own components rather than cut out the images from the book.&#10;&#10;The book retained the original theme from the game as played in the 1810's, with images showing Napoleonic war era uniforms and weapons.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The FTCN (Federation of Time-Traveling Capable Nations) has voted that all nations must give up their time travel capabilities. A single task force of &ldquo;time editors&rdquo; (agents that specialize in changing the timeline) will be kept on standby in the event that they are needed to save humanity from any possible future disasters. Only the nation with the most skilled time editors will retain their use of time travel. The task force of time editors will be chosen through a &ldquo;time editing&rdquo; trial. The first nation to prevent four disastrous past events will retain the use of time travel and will have command of the official global task force of time editors.&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&#10;PLAY:&#10;The game is a blend of:&#10;&bull; resource and economy management&#10;&bull; a worker placement system in the present and past&#10;&bull; storytelling&#10;&#10;To win the game you must prevent 4 disastrous events in the past from happening.&#10; Player mats have two halves - past and present. People and resources you take to the past can only be used in the past. People and resources you keep in the present can only be used in the present. Each player has 4 types of time editing specialists: Science, Technology, Military, and Politics. Specialists have unique abilities when they are in the present, but when they travel back in time to change the past you lose their abilities in the present.&#10;&#10;You can send 1 to 4 specialists back in time if you have the necessary resources. Sending multiple, or all, at once will reduce the wormhole resources needed by reducing the number of time jumps (1 per turn). But keeping some specialists in the present will allow you to use their abilities to strengthen your economy, intelligence, and undermine other nations. Who and when you send where is your choice!&#10;&#10;Each player is given unique disasters in the past that they will need to prevent. (There are 16 time lines with 80 unique events). In order to change the time line and prevent a disaster, you must change the events leading up to the disaster. Certain specialists are needed to change specific events but you can decide which event you travel to. Attempts at changing the time line involve storytelling (a game tester favorite!) and pulling tiles to create ripples through time.&#10;&#10;In order to time travel and pay specialists to change the past, you will need an economy. There are over 130 possible economic setups with variable risk/reward factors. Players explore planets, build mining colonies, mine resources and transport them to Earth. Planets further from Earth have richer mining deposits but will take longer to reach (unless you can afford to create wormholes or pay to use other players&rsquo; wormholes).&#10;&#10;Resources can only be used once they are returned to Earth, so you will need to plan ahead multiple turns for where/when your time ship will be and which specialists are where/when. Resources can be used to buy items for your economy, buy action cards (draw 3 &amp; choose 1), open wormholes in space (for faster travel to planets), open wormholes in time (to change the past), pay time editing specialists to change the past, or hire A. I. to give you the probability of causing a time ripple.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Who will create the most harmonious quilt that satisfies the client's demands?&#10;&#10;To set up, each player receives their own 8x8 game board, playing on either the easy or normal side of the board. The board features a 2x2 central space as well as a number of holes and spots for ornamentation. You lay out two main order cards and one secondary order card at random, along with 5-9 pieces of silk cloth in the four colors, adjusting the quantity based on the player count. Additionally, you have high-quality silk patches that cover either a 1x1 or 2x1 space, with these pieces being of a fifth and sixth color. Place one piece of silk of the main four colors on the matching spaces on the market board. Give each player three coins, with the start player taking an additional coin.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can either move the token on the market board to a different color and take the silk piece and any coins from this space, or pay 2 coins to choose any silk piece from the main four colors, whether from the market board or in the reserves. (The start player can place the token on any of the four colors on the first turn.) You then place the silk on your board. Your first piece must cover at least one square in the center of your game board; each subsequent piece must lie orthogonally adjacent to a piece already on your board, and pieces of the same color cannot be adjacent to one another!&#10;&#10;If you cover an ornament space on your board, you can pay a coin to take a high-quality silk piece and place it on your board. If you cover another ornament space, you can do this again. To end your turn, (if needed) choose a silk piece from the reserve of the same color that you took and place it on the market board, then place a coin from the bank on any market space that doesn't have the token in it.&#10;&#10;Whenever you achieve a secondary order during play, such as covering a hole with high-quality silk or placing a second piece of the same shape, you receive a bonus immediately.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the game ends. You receive a bonus based on how well you completed the main orders, such as creating a silk-filled square or filling the diagonals of your board. Additionally, each filled vertical or horizontal line is worth 3 points, each uncovered ornament 1 point, each hole -1 point, and each coin 1 point as long as you have at least three coins. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!&#10;&#10;disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away&#10;&#10;Objective:  You are in a fierce naval battle in dense foggy weather.  Your mission is to find and sink all five of your opponent's ships before he does the same to you.&#10;&#10;Preparation:  Each player scratches the center of the battleship on their own side of the card to reveal their color code of ships in the game.  One player has red ships, the other player had blue ships.  Each player has one Battleship (four sections long). two Cruisers (three sections long), and two Destroyers (two sections long).&#10;&#10;How to Play:  Beginning with the red player, take turns scratching any one square.  By doing so, a player both removes the &quot;fog&quot; and takes a &quot;shot&quot; at that square.  Because of the fog, a player may accidentally hit part of his own ship, as sometimes happens in real life.  Be careful!&#10;&#10;When all the sections of a ship are hit, the ship is sunk.&#10;&#10;The Mine:  When either player hits a mine, it explodes, and that player immediately scratches all eight surrounding squares if they haven't already been scratched.  This will usually cause damage to both player's ships.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!&#10;&#10;disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away&#10;&#10;Objective:  You are in the dare dungeon of the infamous Count Dracula, searching for the famous treasure of jewels know the be hidden in his caskets.  The player who gets away with the most jewels of his own color by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Preparation: Each player scratches one of the two skull eyes at the bottom of the game card to &quot;see&quot; which color jewels they are seeking.  The &quot;blue&quot; player is player number 1 and is searching for blue numbers representing sapphires.&#10;&#10;The &quot;red&quot; player is player number 2 and is searching for red numbers representing rubies.&#10;&#10;How to Play:  Player number 1 starts the game by scratching one of the six circles (hiding places) in the bottom of any of the caskets.  The following things may be discovered:&#10;&#10;BLUE NUMBERS - You have discovered that many sapphires.&#10;RED NUMBERS - You have discovered that many rubies.&#10;BAT - You immediately lose your turn&#10;CRUCIFIX - The value of all jewels in the casket doubles.&#10;DRACULA - You awaken Dracula!  You must close the casket without taking out any of the jewels.  Immediately scratch off the three boxes in the lid and subtract one point from your score for each sapphire or ruby found in that casket so far.&#10;&#10;A player may continue his turn as long as he wishes.   But, when the player uncovers a bat or a Dracula, it then becomes the opponent's turn.&#10;&#10;To collect the jewels discovered in the casket, you must be the player who successfully &quot;closes&quot; the casket's lid.  When the casket is closed, the other player's jewels and any remaining uncovered treasure are lost forever.  Remember, no points are scored until the lid is closed.&#10;&#10;You may attempt to close a casket at any time as long as at least one hiding place has been scratched.  To close a casket, search for the word &quot;close&quot; in one of the three boxes in the casket's lid.  Uncovering a &quot;squeak&quot; in the lid caused the player to lose his turn and the casket remains open.&#10;&#10;When you close a casket, chisel the score on your tombstone scoring area.  When all caskets are closed, the game is over.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!&#10;&#10;disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:  An invasion of UFOs is hovering over the Bermuda Triangle.  You operate a series of Coast Guard Rescue Stations located just outside the area.&#10;&#10;YOUR MISSION: pilot rescue choppers into the dangerous Triangle in search of human survivors.  But don't let the UFOs zap you out of the Solar System.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY (solo version):  You have enough choppers for six rescue flights.  Start each mission by scratching the triangle in front of any rescue station, indicated by a black dot along the sides of the large triangle.  From there, fly in any direction by scratching any triangle that is next to the space you currently occupy.&#10;  &#10;Continue flying through the triangles in search of human ships.  You can move one space at a time, in any direction you desire.  Some spaces will be empty, but others will reveal the following:&#10; DINGY - 1 person aboard&#10;&#10;ROWBOAT - 3 people aboard&#10;&#10;YACHT - 7 people aboard&#10;&#10;CLIPPER - 10 people aboard&#10;&#10;UFO - Zap! A UFO abducts you and all your passengers back to Andromeda to work as slaves in a pyramid factory.  This ends that mission and you score no points.  There are about half a dozen UFOs hiding in the triangles, mostly near the outside edge.&#10;&#10;RADAR - Radar indicates that a ship larger than a dingy lies in the direction shown within four spaces.&#10;MISSION - Uncovering an &quot;M&quot; give you fuel for an extra mission, if you can return safely from your present one.  If your are capture by a UFO before returning, you lose the extra mission and all the survivors on this trip.&#10;&#10;To rescue survivors, you must get them out by flying off any side of the Triangle without running into a UFO. This ends the mission and allows you to score 1 point for each survivor you picked up.  You can fly out of the Triangle right away, or take a chance searching for more survivors before heading out.  Each mission must start from a new rescue station and, since you don't want to waste fuel searching an area twice, a new mission path cannot cross over an old one.&#10;&#10;Rescue 50 or more humans to win the game.&#10;&#10;TWO PLAYER VERSION - The game plays the same except that players take turns for 3 missions each.  The player rescuing the most humans wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!&#10;&#10;disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:  You are risk-seeking archaeologists on a expedition for exotic treasure.  Danger surrounds you and your archrival is out to beat you to the fortune.  The player who collects the most treasure by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:  Take turns trying to locate a treasure by drawing straight lines between any 2 dots on the map.  Lines can be drawn vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.  When you draw a line that connects all four sides of a square, the find at that location is yours.  Immediately scratch off that spot to reveal a prize (or perhaps trouble).  If you locate treasure, circle the matching item on your stone scoring tablet to keep a record of your newly found wealth.  There are four different kinds of treasure:&#10;&#10;GOLD COINS - Worth 1 point each&#10;BLACK PEARLS - Worth 5 points each&#10;CUT RUBIES - Worth 10 points each&#10;SOLID GOLD ICON - Worth 25 points&#10;&#10;After finding a reassure, you must immediately continue your turn by drawing another line; even if you don't want to.  Archaeology is a dangerous business and sometimes you get more that you bargained for.  Head hunters are about and thief is lurking somewhere in the area.  If you happen to find either, you're in trouble.&#10;&#10;HEAD HUNTER - A threatening little person who stops you in your tracks.  You lose your turn immediately (but you're too clever to lose you head).  Nevertheless, your opponent takes a turn while you figure your way out of this predicament.&#10; THIEF- An encounter with the thief is a costly mistake.  He is well trained at slipping through your fingers and takes with him one piece of the most valuable treasure you have discovered so far.  If you have any treasure, mark one piece of the best off your stone tablet.  It's gone for good.&#10;&#10;Super Secret Rule of Archaeological Exploration:  Treasure is found in groups.  Find something valuable and the rest of the same treasure is sure to be connected!&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most points after all six moles have been caught wins.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION - Write the player's initials in the coring area.  Players then scratch the squares on the bottom of the card to determine who goes first.  The player finding the number &quot;1&quot; starts the game by digging the first hole (scratching a circle). The moles you seek are pink, blue, black, yellow, green and purple.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY - To find moles, you &quot;dig&quot; holes on the golf course by scratching any circle.  You can find all sorts of stuff in a hole - information on where the moles are hiding, bonus points, or nasty traps the moles have set for you!  After each hole is dug, the turn passes to the next player on the left (unless otherwise stated).  Use hashmarks in the scoring area to keep score.  Here is what you might dig up:&#10;&#10;MOLE - 5 points&#10;GOLF BALL - 1 point&#10;POISON GOLF BALL - Minus 1 point&#10;SNAKE (Hiss!) - Lose your next turn&#10;MOLE POOP - Lose your next turn&#10;EMPTY HOLE - Nothing, zip, zero.&#10;&#10;Digging up the following items will give you important information:&#10;&#10;FLASHLIGHTS - Shine light on moles of the same color.  The mole will be somewhere within the &quot;total area of circles&quot; defined by the direction of the &quot;beam of light&quot;.  This helpful light also allows you to continue your turn.&#10;&#10;MOLE HOLES - The mole of this color is somewhere in line with this symbol.&#10;&#10;MOLE METER - A number 2, 3 or 4.  There is a mole (of this color) that number of circles away.&#10;&#10;DYNAMITE - It blows up!  You must scratch off all the neighboring circles that surround the explosive and score them as normal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
