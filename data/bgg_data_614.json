    "Description": "Shax is a traditional game from the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the Morris family. Like other games from that family, its origins date back to antiquity. The game is played by nomadic shepherds and city dwellers where a class of professional players has emerged.&#10;&#10;Shax is played on the same board as Nine Men's Morris, but with twelve pieces for each player. Play consists of two phases: the setup phase and the movement phase. In the setup phase, players take turns putting one piece on the board. Unlike in Nine Men's Morris, no pieces are removed when a jare (three-in-a-row, mill, literally: &quot;cut&quot;) is formed during the setup. It is only noted who formed the first jare.&#10;&#10;In the movement phase, the player who formed the first jare moves first (if no jare was formed in the setup phase, the second player starts). He does so by removing one arbitrary piece of the opponent in order to create space for movement. The opponent does the same. Then players take turns moving their stones as in the other Morris games.&#10;&#10;If a jare is formed in the movement phase, the player removes a piece of the opponent. Note that - again unlike other Morris games - pieces in a jare are never protected against capture. Another important difference is that blocking does not constitute a win. If a player is locked in, he may demand that the opponent moves his stones until the blockade is removed. No advantage may be taken from these extra moves. In particular, if a jare is formed during these moves, then no capture is performed. There is no &quot;flying phase&quot; when a player is reduced to three pieces or less. The player who loses all his pieces loses the game.&#10;&#10;Numerous references to Shax exist in proverbs and Somalian literature. Favorable patterns of stones have got their own names.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overview - You are a citizen in a city, either working for the good guys (the Innocents) or the bad guys (the Guilty). The game consists of several &quot;trials&quot; that take place. There is a narrator who is the judge of these trials. He runs the trials but must remain impartial. Every trial ends either with everyone going to sleep (mistrial) or with an execution. The Innocents are trying to convict the Guilty criminals while the criminals are trying to remain hidden and get Innocents executed. Also, one or two of the Guilty criminals are murderers who kill a citizen after every trial while everyone sleeps.&#10;&#10;The game centers on someone who is the Detective trying to hunt down all of the Guilty before they murder everyone. If the Guilty try to kill the Detective, the final round of the game commences. The citizens may still vote to convict criminals, but the Detective has his trusty sidearm and can shoot citizens at will! But he must be careful, if he kills any Innocent player the game is over and the guilty win! There are also several roles to help the Innocent (heroes, lawyers, vigilantes...etc.) and the Guilty (serial killers, pyromaniacs, dirty cops...etc.). All roles are hidden, so make sure you don't trust your friends, they might be trying to get you killed!&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Detective is a role playing/negotiation/strategy game similar to Mafia/Werewolf. It is slightly more complicated and advanced, and should probably be played by people who have experience with those games. You are dealt a role telling you your powers and which side you are on. You must then try to figure out who is on the opposing side and get them executed, and who is on your side so that you may protect them. Revealing your role card is not allowed, but feel free to lie and deceive your way to winning.&#10;&#10;Components: All that you absolutely must have is the deck of cards to play (which can be found here). But it is strongly recommended that you play this game with a loaded cap gun for added tension and theme. Dark lighting and theme music will also enhance the experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher web page&#10;&#10;Convoy is an operational-tactical game of the Battle of the Atlantic in WW2. Combining large-scale map movement with a fast-play set of tactical rules, the game lets players follow a convoy from embarkation to destination in a single play session.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;map game&quot;, convoys move in eight-hour operational turns, rolling for engagements with U-boats, blockade runners, raiders, and even weather. A large-scale map and tables generate one or more events each turn. Some events are resolved immediately with a few die rolls. Others, such as attacjs by U-boats or raiders are resolved with the fast-play tactical rules.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Atlantic is broken down into several areas and periods, each covered in a seperate map/game module. Deadly Waters is the first such module, covering the Gibraltar Run from January 1941 through December 1942. Each module includes a CD-ROM with full-color damage cards for all the ships and subs needed for convoy battles in that period.&#10;&#10;Convoy will be supported by other map games currently under development. These cover other parts of the Battle of the Atlantic as well as the desperate Murmansk/Soviet lifeline. Designed by Mal Wright, the game system incorporates Mal's thorough research of published sources including interviews with veterans from both sides of the conflict, and illustrates the operational realities of the Battle of the Atlantic.&#10;&#10;Both the map game booklets and tactical rules emphasize simplicity and fast play. Accompanied by sidebars and historical background, they are an excellent introduction for a gamer new to naval warfare, or one who wants to deepen his understanding of this critical naval campaign.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.&#10;&#10;The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. The Japanese player has the ability to conduct Banzai attacks at night and these cause considerable damage as the US player cannot fall back in front of these attacks and must take casualties.&#10;&#10;The are 4 scenarios that simulate the The Recapture of Guam, the Seizure of the Orote Peninsula (introductory scenario), From Mount Barrigada to the Northern Shores, and The Fight for Southern Guam.  There are numerous options that can be used to even play between players and make the fight more interesting.

Shuffle the cards and deal 6 to each player.Place the remaining cards face down as a &quot;draw&quot; pile, within reach of all players for use throughout the game.&#10;&#10;2. Elect a player to start&#10;&#10;3. Player 1 starts by placing any one of their cards face up beside the &quot;draw&quot; pile as a &quot;Call card&quot;. Cards placed on top of his in turn become the call card.&#10;&#10;4. The game continues in a clockwise direction with each placing one card from their hand onto the call card pile. The card played must be:&#10;(a) a card of any number but the same image as the call card OR&#10;(b) a card of any image but the same number as the call card&#10;OR&#10;(c) a GET OUT! card which can be played as any image&#10;&#10;5. If a player cannot play a card onto the call card pile they must take the top card from the draw pile and add it ti their hand. That player's turn ends on drawing a card - they cannot play it on the same turn.&#10;&#10;6. GET OUT! cards can be played by any player, on their turn, on to any call card. The player may then declare the image to be represented by their GET OUT! card which dictates the next card to follow. The player may choose an image that will help himself or hinder their opponent. One GET OUT! card can be played on top of another GET OUT! card - to cancel a previous call or to keep it the same.&#10;&#10;7. Players do not have to play a card even if they are able to, but they must pick up a card from the draw pile. This might happen when player is playing defensively.&#10;&#10;8. If draw pile runs out, the last call card is left face up in the center of play and the rest of the cards are placed face down (without shuffling) and the game proceeds as before.&#10;&#10;9. The game ends when one player runs out of cards - who is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Play of GET OUT! may be extended by continuing as follows:&#10;&#10;10. When one player runs out of cards, all other players add uo the total value of the cards in their hands. GET OUT! cards count as 20 points.&#10;&#10;11.

Each set has a plastic container containing six special dice (each die shows a picture of a raven and two to six pips on the sides). Half of the container has a transparent wall to allow players to see their own dice. &#10;The game mechanism is similar to Liar's Dice, with players stating higher and higher numbers of specific faces of dice, until one or the other player is forced to call the other player's bluff (or truthful call). The raven side of the die is treated like a wild card, but once a number of ravens is called, may no longer be used as a wild card.&#10;Sets come as Classic or Gold editions - Gold editions have sturdier containers. The Classic edition has dice with either black or purple pips; the Gold edition has dice with blue pips. In all editions, the ravens are black.&#10;The theme of the game is linked to a fantasy story, which is also on sale at the website.&#10;&#10;",

The dice rolling and special spaces are no longer present;  each player instead has the opportunity to ask 3 yes/no questions about one sculpture, and then make a guess.  Instead of arrows, the sculptures are moved up a staircase each time a player asks questions about it.  The middle steps award the most points to the sculptor if their riddle is solved there, while the first steps (too easy) award fewer points, and the top step (too difficult) penalizes the sculptor points.&#10;&#10;The players are also dealt cards at the beginning of the game, and must choose their sculptures from these cards.

Following the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty of China in 1911, the Tian Di Hui suddenly found themselves without purpose. They could no longer rely on donations from sympathetic locals.  Being unable to resume normal civilian lives after years of hiding, they turned to illegal activities - thus giving birth to the modern Triad gangs.  As the Tian Di Hui spread through different parts of China, it branched off into many groups.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;In this game, compete with other Tian Di Hui factions to collect black market items and sell them to smugglers.  Players take turns purchasing cards from various dealers and collectors (card areas) and build poker hands to challenge for a set number of different valued pots.  The person with the most money after the rush of items completes is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(User Summary compiled from back cover and introduction):&#10;&#10;This supplement introduces a new team of gladiators: the Spiders. Phaze Spiders bring a new dimension (pun intended!) to the Injurius Games universe. They employ an intense and flexible battle plan, using ranged and melee attacks equally well. Squads of five Spiders take the field against all comers: Humans, Mecks, Orx, and even their own kind.&#10;&#10;You control a &quot;clutch&quot; of up to six different types of Spiders. Before each match, you choose which ones will participate, either all the same, all different, or any combination thereof. Each clutch is led by the big &quot;Tlisky,&quot; a formidable fighter, born to command. The other Spiders, called Vorpeeds, participate as needed: Venters are the rank-and-file Spiders, able to spit highly-corrosive acid at a distance; Shockers generate massive electric currents that can take you out with one hit; Bullnoses are the party-crashers, melee specialists that can also make short-ranged plasma attacks; Jammers have evolved a very advanced ranged weapon that ignores most forms of armor; The &quot;Tlisk&quot; is a failed Tlisky, unable to lead and not as tough, but faster.&#10;&#10;Spiders are not under any form of Corporate control. They enter the arena looking for two things: freedom, and puppets to control. Freedom they can't have, but puppets - the arena supplies five per enemy team....&#10;&#10;The Spider player's goal is the same as with any race: to bring their Clutch up to 50 Battle Honors and win the tournament. Spiders have their own upgrade table, critical hit chart, and Power-Ups, and may spend their Battle Honors to purchase upgrades like any other gladiator team.&#10;&#10;You will need a copy of Injurius Games to play Phaze Spiders from the 5th Dimension.&#10;&#10;",
