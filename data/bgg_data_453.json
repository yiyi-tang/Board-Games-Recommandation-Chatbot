Statistically, the German Army proved to be the most formidable armed forces ever known to modern warfare. At the end of the war, statistics showed that, regardless of whether the German ground forces won a battle or lost it, whether they outnumbered their enemy or even if they, themselves, were outnumbered, the German Army inflicted fifty percent more casualties on the enemy than they suffered. The Waffen-SS units were even deadlier by doubling what their Army counterparts achieved. Within this package you will see just how awesome was their fight.&#10;&#10;These scenarios represent the Waffen-SS as hunter and hunted, hero and hated. They are some of the most vicious battles fought during World War II, and they cover the full spectrum of the Allied fight against Hitler. The great effort with which it took to liberate Europe from the fists of the Waffen-SS can be fully appreciated within this package.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Advanced Squad Leader&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Waffen-SS II: Fuhrer's Firemen&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It is not just a supplement, though, but a complete rule system in its own right. As the title suggests, it enables the players to expand their hunting activities into the Age of Mammals, and to take on a wide range of quarry - living, extinct or simply mysterious - from prehistoric saber-tooths to modern African big game.&#10;&#10;Each player may choose to control either a human hunter character, or an animal. The hunters move, shoot etc. in a fairly conventional &quot;skirmish wargame&quot;  sort of way, by means of dice, while for the animal players we have introduced a card driven system, using an ordinary pack of playing cards. The intention is to bring out the difference between human intelligence - as represented, however unlikely it may sound, by the wargamer - and that of the quarry, who should combine a limited range of tactical options with an element of unpredictability. To compensate for this, the animals will usually be able to move faster than the hunters, and will have a decisive advantage if they manage to get to close range.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a movable platform with a Karate champion action figure, roughly a foot tall, attached to the end.  The platform has three control levers which allow you to left jab, right chop or right kick.  Each figure has two pressure or impact points (one on the head and one on the chest).  The object is to strike a blow to your opponent which triggers the pressure point and causes them to fall backwards.&#10;&#10;The Karate champions both have a brown belt to begin with.  If you win the match (first player to four points) you get to trade in your brown belt for a black belt.&#10;&#10;The neat thing about the game is that it doesn't use batteries.  It also has tightening screws on the bottom of the  platform to ensure the spring like mechanisms work correctly.&#10;&#10;The rules are quite simple, however, they also include penalties for cheating (ex. lifting the platform during the fight).&#10;&#10;",

This family boardgame was published in 2006 to accompany the launch of the unavoidable movie.&#10;&#10;The game simulates the rescue missions. The board divides the Belgian coast and part of the sea in sectors. You have to respond to an SOS, pick up the survivors with one of the six helicopters and transport them to a nearby hospital corresponding with your playing color. The helicopters can be moved by all the players. Each player decides in secret how many spaces each chopper will move. You gain points for each successful delivery (the number of points depends on the mission). After a fixed amount of missions, the player with the most points wins. Event cards spice up the game.&#10;&#10;The game contains 6 cardboard &quot;3D&quot; Seeking rescue-choppers.&#10;&#10;",

Players are liable to meet many obstacles along the way. Luck and skill are important factors in players acquiring their ration cards. Numerous helpful as well as hindering elements that make the trip a most exciting experience can to a certain degree be determined by the players themselves but others are left to chance. As is natural during the present emergency, the players will take these encounters in stride like the good American he/she is.&#10;&#10;Each time around the board the person stops at a different Ration Board and tries to acquire a different ration card by fulfilling different requirements; BUTTER roll a 5 or a DOUBLE, SUGAR roll an 8 or a 2 or a 12 etc.  The first player to acquire 5 ration cards and return home is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game board is a road winding through the countryside and suburbs to a city where the Ration Boards are stationed and then back again to home.&#10;&#10;Additional info: Contained 8 wooden car pawns and 2 wooden dice, and was &quot;item number 432&quot; from Jayline Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia, PA.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A precis of the rule&rsquo;s introduction.&#10;&#10;These rules are intended for use with one infantry section (usually 10 men), in 54mm scale, per player, which attacks a small objective such as a machine gun bunker or defended house (Airfix Strongpoint). Start with the basic rules, and when you have mastered these add some or all of the more realistic advanced rules. You can use any scale, of course - half all distances for 25mm scale, and if you insist on fighting Stalingrad in a matchbox an the 10.30 from Paddington, divide distances by 10 and use 5mm figures! As is inevitable, this has escalated to whole platoons (often still with one player per section) with some support such as a medium machine gun team or man-pack flamethrower team per side. We've never bothered very much about a points system, though one is included in the appendices to these rules, except that men defending a strong position such as a farmhouse should be attacked by about twice their number. Favourite games include two units of 10 partisans each, ambushing a German staff car with escort of two motorcycle combinations and a section in a half track, and a British Recce unit consisting of a turret less Stuart tank, a Dingo scout car and a half-track with infantry section running into a German advanced defence unit in slit trenches with MMG's and Panzerfausts. The possibilities are enormous, and great variety can be achieved quite cheaply, using Britain&rsquo;s or Airfix figures and vehicles, which are less prone to damage than Tamiya and other plastic models, though we use these too!&#10;&#10;Each soldier must have the correct rank, weapons and equipment, a limited supply of ammunition (so that he can run out!) and is identified by a number on his base. This number ensures that each man stays with his correct unit - if he's more than 20cm. from it, he has deserted! Wounds are NOT bullet wounds - you don&rsquo;t go anywhere with a bullet, in you, no matter WHAT John Wayne gets up to! Wounds restrict a man's fighting ability, and may eventually prevent him from fighting, though he may recover in time for a later round if you are fighting a campaign.&#10;&#10;",

They also manage population, treasury, and war.  &#10;The game includes pawns that indicate level of royalty, and advancement cards like: Longbow, Sanitation, and Chivalry.  Also, mixed in with the cards are events like Corruption, Peasant Revolt, and Black Death. The player who is the current ruler has the ability to tax and forbid other players to perform particular actions.  In this way, that player has more control over events, but also is a bigger target for war and assassination.&#10;The winner is the player who manages to survive two rounds by either having the only living population or being the ruler and only player with cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game that attracted little attention when it was published in the eighties, despite the reputation of its designer. The concept was developed by French essayist Guy Debord (1931-1994) in 1965, but not published for many years. Debord described himself as a filmmaker, but he is known as the founder and one of the most important members of the Situationist International, a small band of avant-garde artists and revolutionaries. One key concept of their theory is the spectacle: the image replaces substance and modern capitalist society is a society of &quot;spectacular&quot; commodity consumption. Having long been treated as a producer, the worker is now courted and seduced as a consumer.&#10;&#10;In 1977, Debord created a small publishing company named &quot;Les Jeux Strat&eacute;giques et Historiques&quot; with French movie producer G&eacute;rard Lebovici. The first game was Debord's &quot;Le Jeu de la Guerre&quot;, but only 4 prototypes are produced. The game was published as a book, with a map, rules and detailed descriptions in 1987. (Lebovici had been mysteriously shot in a parking lot in Paris by this time). In 1991, Guy Debord decides to insist that all his movies &amp; books be destroyed. It is also the fate of his book/game. Debord committed suicide in 1994. Nevertheless during the '90s, his work gains more and more influence. The book/game is published again in 2006 by French publisher Gallimard (price: 18 &euro;), but it's only a book (in French), co-signed by Debord's lifetime partner Alice Becker-Ho.&#10;&#10;The game uses a mapboard containing 500 squares (25 x 20) divided in two by a border line. Each territory has 2 arsenal squares, 3 fortress squares, and 9 mountain squares (blocking movement,shooting and communication lines). Setup of units (infantry, cavalry, artillery, horse artillery) is free and secret. At his turn, each player may move up to 5 units and/or attack. Aim of the game is to completely destroy the enemy or conquer his 2 arsenals. No dice: combats are resolved taking into account the attack/defense ratios of the opponents (unit retreats from -1, and is destroyed from -2) Communication lines are critical.&#10;&#10;The English translation published by Atlas has a faulty translation of the rules, making it more or less unplayable.&#10;&#10;",

A large bell is placed in the center space of the board.  The leader for a round rolls one die to determine the target number.  Immediately after that all players begin rolling all of their dice as fast as possible.  Any time a player rolls the target number they must place any dice with that number in the center of the board and call out how many dice along they are toward getting all five with the target number.  They then continue to roll the rest of their dice.  When a player gets all five of their dice to match, they ring the bell and win the round moving one space on their track.&#10;&#10;",

Obviously many cards contain duplicate images, so reaching this goal may require more than four correct answers.&#10;&#10;All information is taken from the book Dinosaurs by Michael and Caroline Carroll; religious content is held to a minimum on the cards themselves (2 of 100 questions).&#10;&#10;",

So there can be a chain of turns for a team until a question has not been answered correctly and the time runs out.

If the move ends on an unexplored token the player will claim the token unless the token is a monster in which case the monster has to be defeated first by rolling dice. Some items - sweets, to be precise - boost a player's speed or combat ability.&#10;&#10;Kalevite Maa is a promotional boardgame.

It has been a peaceful night over all, only one bank robbery, and that you stopped with the help of Kid Zip. The explosion rolling out of the building below you then breaks the silence. You watch with your super eyesight as the green color smoke rolls out of the window of one of Sonic Lab&rsquo;s windows. You watch as Doctor Death leaps into the air from that very window, a beaker of the hyper explosive, chemical Y, tightly held in his armed fist. You thought he was still in jail, serving a 300-year sentence for his last attempt at destroying the city. With a sigh you dive into the coming fight, sure it will be another long night ahead. Who said being a super hero was all capes and fun.&#10;&#10;Comic Book Heroes is a multi player card game where you take on the role of either a super powered hero or one of their many villainous foes. Streaking through the skies in your hyper jet boots, or crash through brink walls with your super strong muscles.

Struggle with and aid other players as they battle each other to see who will be the hero supreme.&#10;&#10;So let the cosmic beams fuel your dreams of glory, the mutant genes turn you into a freak with a heart of gold or allow sinister plots to fill you with a destiny for glory and dominance of all mankind. Play Comic Book Heroes and live the adventure.&#10;&#10;Each set comes with two characters, a hero and a villain with 18 cards for each.

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Down with the Empire is a game that uses a common theme of science-fiction sagas: A Stellar Empire that has gone rotten, and a rebellion that rises to bring it down. It is primarily a two-player game, although it is possible to have more than one player per side by dividing forces or tasks. The game can also be played solitaire. The game system is inspired in the old Freedom in the Galaxy game from SPI.&#10;&#10;There are two major factions in the game, each controlled by a player. The Stellar Empire owns everything at start, and strives to maintain the status quo through its military might. The Rebel Concordance player owns nothing but a few characters and spaceships at start, but by causing unrest and rebellion throughout the Empire, he hopes to get resources that will allow him or her eventually to meet the Empire on equal terms.&#10;&#10;The game presents you with action at very different scopes. First, you have to administer 50+ planets on a grand-strategic scale, with social, economic and political aspects that are tightly intertwined and can be handled in very different styles.&#10;&#10;Then you will be in charge of large military units; starfleets formed by individual starships ranging from tiny fighters to mammoth battlestars, and ground units (legions, brigades and divisions) to slug it out on planet surfaces. War in space is a very complex affair, since you can't establish battle lines or prevent the enemy from hyperjumping to any location on the map&hellip; He who defends everything defends nothing, goes the maxim, and quick response is the key to victory.&#10;&#10;Finally, the heart and soul of DWTE are the individual characters. As in all great space adventures, the huge starships may bumble about, but they do not determine the fate of the rebellion saga as much as the astounding contributions of a handful of heroes. The characters perform missions through which they hope to sway the people to join and support their cause, undermine the plans of the enemy and further their own side's goals. During the missions characters face all sorts of dangers, including firefights with lasers blazing against enemy soldiers or monsters, cantina brawls with unruly civilians, getting lost in wormholes, or such everyday occurrences as meteorites falling on your head!&#10;&#10;Key Points:&#10;A grand-scale science-fiction strategy game, which at the same time has a very detailed combat system with individual spaceships and ground military units, and a role-playing aspect with individual characters performing heroic deeds.&#10;&#10;The wide variety of events in the game and the ramifications derived from players' choices and styles of play ensure that no two games will play alike.&#10;&#10;It is a large game with a moderately high level of complexity, but once the rules are learned the game itself flows easily and the on-map counter density is not high.&#10;&#10;Component List:&#10;Full-color Stellar map&#10;Full-color Rebel and Imperial Starfleet Displays&#10;Over 1,400 counters&#10;Over 200 Character, Item and Stellar Event cards&#10;4 sheets of Charts and Tables&#10;Campaign Scenario&#10;108 page Rules manual&#10;20-, 10- and 6-sided dice (not provided) are necessary for the PDF version of the game&#10;&#10;Target Audience:&#10;DWTE appeals especially to SF-buffs with an interest in space adventures and sagas, although its fascinating game system will be interesting and challenging for any gamer. The rules are written in a clear language with extensive explanations and examples of play. They have a logical, easily-referenced order and should not present any special difficulty even for inexperienced players.&#10;&#10;Game Formats:&#10;Virtual Tabletop&#10;PDF Download&#10;&#10;What is a Virtual Tabletop Game? &#10;Our line of Virtual Tabletop games are powered by the Vassal Engine.&#10;&#10;",

Color frames around some card images distinguish the red human needs cards (food, shelter, climate regulation&hellip;) and the green cards that distinguish important landscape elements from the rest of the set. Laying down families of 3 or more cards (we give lists of examples), the players build up the design of a landscape and they can exchange cards between families.The game ends with a set of card families laid down as a draft landscape design.&#10;&#10;",
