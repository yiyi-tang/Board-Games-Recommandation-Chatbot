It covers the French invasion of Russia in 1812 and their attempt to force a political collapse against the Tsar.&#10;&#10;Units are infantry corps and cavalry divisions, who each belong to one of their nation's Army Groups. Army groups are led by leaders who generate Command Points each turn, used to order units under their command.&#10;&#10;French supply is limited, the player must manage this limited resource throughout the whole campaign in order to succeed. The Russian player must carefully manage a defensive campaign while keeping the pressure on Poland and Prussia. The Russian player must also manage national morale as to not demoralize the population by burning down cities and the countryside, as was done historically.&#10;&#10;Combat has players rolling 1-3d6 depending on the number of Strength Points being used in combat. Both sides must manage Attrition as to make sure not to whittle away their forces needlessly. The game covers the drive on Moscow from late June through the end of December of 1812. Prussian and Austrian units are included as they were present historically.&#10;&#10;Each hex is approximately 25 miles. Each turn covers 2 weeks and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 10,000 men and their accompanying artillery batteries.&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 4/10&#10;SOLITAIRE: 7/10&#10;PLAYERS: 1-2&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One of them is the murderer and the others must figure out who it is by studying the clues, police report, map, crime scene photos, and cross examining the other players.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s early century, but the rapid development of steam technology makes it feel like we are living in the far future. Steam power has ushered in a technological age with machines and devices that are amazing. Steam power is modern power, yet the age old drives of greed, lust, envy, and hate still guide us, and still, murder happens.&#10;&#10;The guests in this steampunk world arrive at the Lilly Hotel to gather in this quaint place in the middle of town, yet surrounded by woods. Actually, that sounds a little creepy. It&rsquo;s a comfortable establishment with good food, but the Lilly&rsquo;s claim to fame are the seances held there. So ghosts are expected, as are the lost loved ones. Perhaps what is surprising are all the tawdry foibles of the living; greed, secrets, lust, and the soon to be dearly departed.&#10;&#10;So sit down at the table and as soon as the honored guest arrives by steam driven airship you can be assured of an interesting evening&hellip; and that someone ain&rsquo;t gonna make it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&quot;Kiev 1943&quot; is a wargame by Nicolas Stratigos, the third game of the &quot;Storms in the East&quot; VaeVictis jeux d'histoire series.&#10;&#10;After the failure of Zitadelle in mid-July 1943, then the loss of Kharkov on 23 August, the German armies surged back on the Dnieper with the Soviet forces at their heels. The Voronezh Front of Vatutin had the mission of charging on Kiev and destroying the 4. Panzerarmee.&#10;On 21 September, the 3rd Guards Tank Army reached the Dnieper and established a bridgehead at Bukrin, near Kanev, soon joined by the 27th and 70th Armies. On 26 September, the Soviets dropped two paratrooper brigades on Kanev. The operation was a disaster. Meanwhile, the 38th Army forced the river at Lyutezh, 20 km north of Kiev.&#10;The Soviets launched another operation from Bukrin mid-October with no result. The Stavka realised the tactical impasse of this bridgehead and decided &ndash; in absolute secrecy &ndash; to transfer Rybalko&rsquo;s 3rd Guards Tank Army into the pocket of Lyutezh.&#10;Vatutin prepared a large-scale attack on Kiev. On 3 November, more than 2000 canons discharged a flood of fire on the units of the VII. and XIII. Korps; the 68th and 88th infantry divisions were impotent against the 38th Army supported by Kravchenko&rsquo;s 5th Guards Tank Corps. Farther north, the 60th Army attacked in the direction of Korosten.&#10;Despite the counter-attacks of the 7. and 8. Panzer and of the 20th Pz.Grenadier, Rybalko&rsquo;s men entered Kiev and completely liberated it on 6 November. Fastov fell on 7 November, and the Soviet troops advanced on the entire Front. Jitomir fell at the hands of the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps on 12 November. The Soviets advanced more than 120 km to the west!&#10;The Germans sent reinforcements from everywhere. The 25. Panzer somehow slowed down the Soviets at Fastov with numerous losses; the 1. SS, the 2. SS and the 1. Pz Divisions blocked the Soviet advance in the south.&#10;On 13 November, Von Manstein launched a counter offensive with the 48. PzKorps toward Jitomir and Brusilov in the southern flank of the Soviet penetration.&#10;As a Soviet, will you be able to liberate Kiev for the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution ? As a German, will you restore the front of the 4. Panzerarmee ?&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;A game turn represents two days of real time.&#10;One hex covers approximately 6 km.&#10;The units represent divisions, brigades, regiments, KGs, battalions or HQs, with their organic elements.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Un jeu de Nicolas Stratigos dans la collection VaeVictis jeu d'histoire.&#10;&quot;Kiev 1943&quot;, est le 3e volume de la s&eacute;rie &quot;Orage &agrave; l'Est&quot;.&#10;&#10;Apr&egrave;s l&rsquo;&eacute;chec de Zitadelle mi-juillet 1943 puis la perte de Kharkov le 23 ao&ucirc;t, les arm&eacute;es allemandes refluent sur le Dniepr, talonn&eacute;es par les forces sovi&eacute;tiques. Le front de Voronezh de Vatutin a pour mission de foncer sur Kiev et d&eacute;truire la 4. Panzerarmee.&#10;Le 21 septembre, la 3e arm&eacute;e de chars de la Garde atteint le Dniepr et &eacute;tablit une t&ecirc;te de pont &agrave; Boukrine, pr&egrave;s de Kanev, bient&ocirc;t rejoint par les 27e et 70e arm&eacute;es. Le 26 septembre, les Sovi&eacute;tiques larguent deux brigades de parachutistes sur Kanev mais l&rsquo;op&eacute;ration tourne au d&eacute;sastre. Pendant ce temps, la 38e arm&eacute;e force le fleuve &agrave; Lyutezh, 20 km au nord de Kiev. Le 30 septembre, Le groupe d&rsquo;arm&eacute;es Sud a enfin franchi le Dniepr. Mi-octobre, les Sovi&eacute;tiques lancent de nouveau une op&eacute;ration &agrave; partir de Boukrine mais sans r&eacute;sultat. Se  rendant compte de l&rsquo;impasse tactique de cette t&ecirc;te de pont, la Stavka d&eacute;cide le transfert &ndash; dans le plus grand secret &ndash; de la 3e arm&eacute;e blind&eacute;e de la Garde de Rybalko dans la poche de Lyutezh.&#10;Vatutin pr&eacute;pare alors une attaque d&rsquo;envergure sur Kiev. Le 3 novembre, plus de 2 000 canons d&eacute;versent un d&eacute;luge de feu sur les unit&eacute;s des VII. et XIII. Korps, Les 68. et 88. ID ne peuvent rien face &agrave; la 38e arm&eacute;e soutenue par le 5e corps de chars de la Garde. Plus au nord la 60e arm&eacute;e attaque en direction de Korosten.&#10;Malg&eacute; les contre-attaques des 7.et 8. Panzer et de la 20. Pz.Grenadier, les hommes de Rybalko entrent dans Kiev et la lib&egrave;re totalement le 6 novembre. Fastov tombe le 7 novembre, les troupes sovi&eacute;tiques avancent sur tout le front. Jitomir tombe aux mains du  1er corps de cavalerie de la Garde le 12 novembre. Les Sovi&eacute;tiques ont alors avanc&eacute; de plus de 120 km &agrave; l&rsquo;ouest ! Les Allemands envoient des renforts de partout. La 25. Panzer ralentit tant bien que mal les Sovi&eacute;tiques &agrave; Fastov avec de nombreuses pertes, les 1. SS, 2. SS et la 1. Pz bloquent l&rsquo;avanc&eacute;e sovi&eacute;tique au sud.&#10;Le 13 novembre, Von Manstein lance une contre-offensive avec le 48. Panzer Korps vers Jitomir et Brusilov dans le flanc sud de la p&eacute;n&eacute;tration sovi&eacute;tique&hellip;&#10;Saurez vous, en tant que Sovi&eacute;tique, lib&eacute;rer Kiev pour l&rsquo;anniversaire de la R&eacute;volution bolch&eacute;vique et en tant qu&rsquo;Allemand restaurer le front de la 4.

Only those brave&mdash;and perhaps foolish&mdash;enough to stand against the Empire can hope to save the galaxy from this technological terror. Raised by the extremist Saw Gerrera and on her own from a young age, Jyn Erso embodies both of these qualities.&#10;&#10;Reckless and aggressive, Erso is nonetheless a brave leader who can contribute to your battle plan in many ways. Unafraid to wade into battle with her collapsible tonfa drawn, her quick thinking often gets her out of tricky situations. In fact, her Rebellious streak often comes in handy, letting her make a quick strike against an enemy unit or dive for cover before she can be targeted.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Since they&rsquo;re usually already operating on the battlefield before an engagement starts, traditional deployment zones mean little to these troops. Instead, they can deploy anywhere on the battlefield beyond Range 3 of all enemy units. Once they&rsquo;re in position, you&rsquo;ll find the Rebel Pathfinders can quickly adapt to the changing tenor of a battle as they reconfigure their A-300 Blaster Rifles to be effective at both short and long range.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Match the line colors and stations to make your way around town, but beware the everyday perils of rush hour crowds, forgotten farecards, and mysterious puddles as you get where you're going!&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to UNO or Crazy Eights, but instead of matching numbers, suites, or colors, players match the L line or station. For example, if the top of the pile is a Brown Line card for the Washington/Wells station, you can play any other Brown Line, or one or more non-Brown Washington/Wells cards (as if you&rsquo;re transferring lines in real life). The object of the game is to get rid of all of your cards first. The player who most recently used public transportation gets to deal.&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The game is therefore designed to have a dramatic climax and if you are the first to go out, you will always want to see how it plays out.&#10;&#10;Your robots have a Charge Chamber, which when filled can be used to perform upgraded actions to help give you the edge over your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each turn you will perform actions with one robot, then perform actions with your other robot on your next turn.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you will perform up to 3 different actions or the same action twice:&#10;- Run. Move your robot round the arena. Each space on the board can only be travelled over twice so how you move is criticial to your success or demise.&#10;- Jolt. Knock opponent robots (or even your own) one space to gain a tactical and positional advantage!&#10;- Place Force Shields. Inpenetrable shields that you can place adjacent to your robot to use for area control or to help push opponents out&#10;- Drain / Recharge Arena. Use this to take some power from the arena and power up your charge chamber, putting you at more risk or replenish the arena to give you some breathing space&#10;- Jump. As the game progresses you will need this to help get you out of a corner or to cause spectacular KO's&#10;- Upgrade Charge Chamber Capacity. You want to get more powerful actions? Of course you do!&#10;&#10;If you find yourself in a tight spot and see no way out then don't worry! You can use your Prime token to give you some breathing space or to open a path to victory.&#10;&#10;There are multiple variable player powers which provides great replayability and for more variants, there are rules for House Robots who add to the mayhem!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Reader shuffles received cards and successively reads the answers and arranges them on the table. It's best to read the answers together with the question matching the syntax where it's needed. Some questions require two white cards. In this case, the Reader does not shuffle them and reads in the order arranged by players. When all responses have been read, each player points the finger at the funniest answer. The player whose answer got the most votes wins the round and gets the black card as a reward. When it's a draw, each of the drawers wins and gets a black card. Before next round everyone draws cards up to eight, the next player becomes a Reader. The game lasts until no cards, time or participants left. The player who earned the most black cards wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Murder mystery party game for 8-12 players that you host at home. Each player dresses up as a character, one is the murderer and the rest must figure out who that is. To solve the mystery there are clues, police report, crime scene photos, and a map. You go over these materials then question all the players about what their characters did and saw to finally solve who done it. The game lasts a times 2.5 hours.&#10;&#10;Remember the excitement and glamour of your Senior Prom? Well now you can relive it, 1980s style. McKinley High School is having their Senior Prom, and like your typical prom there will be punch, snacks, a student rock band, and the coronation of the prom king and queen.&#10;This could be any American population, with the in-crowd, jocks, geeks, dopers, losers, and even the well liked, super cool drug dealer. Don&rsquo;t you remember how fun it all was?&#10;On this particular prom night though there is more going on than your standard spiked punch and necking in a dark corner. Real murder and mayhem is brewing. By the end of the night you will be shocked and astonished and will have lost a considerable amount of respect for your fellow students and the school faculty (who would have thought!).&#10;So throw on a boutonniere, squeeze into that tiny gown, fluff your hair up big and get ready to boogey on down with some punch, canapes, cookies, and some drop dead entertainment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You&rsquo;ve been hired by Walking Doggos, a subsidiary of Good Boyes, Inc.&#10;&#10;Your job? Walking the goodest doggos every day for minimum wage while their owners are at work.&#10;&#10;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many dogs you walk, or how hard you work, you get paid the same no matter what.&#10;&#10;So, what does a clever slacker like you do? As little as possible without getting fired.&#10;&#10;Walking Doggos is a trick-taking game, where the goal is to take fewer tricks than your opponents while still at least winning one trick. There are six suits of cards: Great Danes, Labradors, Shiba Inus, Beagles, Corgis, and Pugs ranked by size of the breed. Each suit has a card numbered 1 through 8 representing the number of that breed that need to be walked.&#10;&#10;Players each have a hand of 5 cards held face out, so that only other players can see what cards are being held. Players take turns giving clues to other players as to what cards are in their hand. Once every player has 3 clues, players take turns betting how many tricks they are going to take. After all players have made their bets, players take turns playing a card face up into a pack to be walked. The player who played the highest ranked doggo wins the pack. Players get points based on the number of packs they take compared to what they bet. The winner is the player who did the least amount of work necessary without being fired.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "CAB! is an educational card game based on the parts of speech. It involves turn-taking, incidental learning, peer teaching, spelling and grouping. &#10;The game has the potential to improve vocabulary and literacy skills while engaging students in a fun experience.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;Be the first person to get rid of all your cards&#10;&nbsp; &#10;SETUP&#10;Each person draws a card. The player who&rsquo;s card has the greatest number of letters is the dealer. &#10;The dealer shuffles the deck and gives each player 7 cards.&#10;&#10;Then places the remainder of the deck face down to create a &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile. &#10;The dealer takes the top card off the &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile and puts it face up, to begin the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile.&#10;&#10;START PLAYING&#10;The person to the left of the dealer begins the game.&#10;&#10;When it&rsquo;s your turn you must put down a card matching the top card on the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile, either being the same type of word (adjective, noun, verb or conjunction) or having a matching punctuation sign&#10;(!   ,   ?   &lsquo;   :   &ldquo;&rdquo;  . ). &#10;You can also put down any &lsquo;action card&rsquo; (see action card).&#10;&nbsp;&#10;EXAMPLE: If the top card on the &ldquo;put down&rsquo; pile is the word &lsquo;happy&rsquo; with a : on it, the next person must put down either another adjective card, a card with a : on it or a action card (see Action Cards).&#10;&nbsp;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t have a card that matches the card on top of the &lsquo;put down&rsquo;  pile you must pick up a card from the top of the &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile.  This is the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;ACTION CARDS&#10;The following action cards can be placed on the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile at any point during your turn, no matter what the top card on the pile is. When an action card is played the word type is automatically changed to the same as the word on the card being played.&#10;&#10;Pick Up 2  &ndash; When this card is played the next player must pick up two cards and cannot put down any cards. If they have a &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; card as well they can then play that card, making the next person pick up four etc.&#10;Miss A Go  &ndash; When this card is played the next person misses their turn. &#10;Go Back  &ndash; When this card is played the direction of play is reversed. &#10;Spell It &ndash; When this card is played the player putting the card down picks up a card from the &rsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile and asks the player, who's turn it is next, to spell the word. If the word is spelt correctly, the card is placed on the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile and the speller takes his turn. If the word is spelt incorrectly, the card is given to the speller and they miss their turn. The next player in the sequence then starts their turn.&#10;&#10;WINNING&#10;The first person to get rid of all their cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This new edition of Greenland includes the Sea Sami expansion pack so it is playable with up to 4 players.&#10;&#10;The four players in Greenland represent the Tunit (Player Green), Norse (Player Red), Sea S&aacute;mi (Player Blue), and Thule (Player Yellow) tribes inhabiting Greenland from the 11th to the 15th centuries.&#10;&#10;As a tribe, you attempt to secure food, resources, and technology to increase the size of your tribe and support children, elders, and livestock while also wiping out competing species or gathering resources to collect victory points. You must work around the weather and the extinction of natural resources as well as negotiate deals to protect your wives while you decide between monotheism or polytheism. In this tableau-building game, you'll send your population out to hunt native species of Greenland &mdash; but some might not come back. (Historically, the climate turned frigid and all but the Thule (Inuit) died out.)&#10;&#10;In the game, play takes place over six phases; all players complete each phase in turn order, then the next phase starts. Each turn is one generation. In order:&#10;&#10;Resolve events: Examples include elder deaths, animal migrations, feuds, or global cooling. If a trade ship arrives, an auction is held for its wares.&#10;    Assign hunters: Hunters are assigned to hunting grounds, resource gathering, colonizing the New World, raiding other tribes for wives or animals, or promotion to an elder.&#10;    Negotiate: Players can bribe others to peacefully withdraw hunters, including marrying them to their daughters. Players with a War Chief Elder can use hunters to attack others on the same card. The New World turns hostile if there are too many colonists.&#10;    Resolve hunting: Roll a die for each hunter and modify it for technologies and marriages. Success can result in gaining new hunters, resources, hand cards, wives, and/or technologies. Beware, as some animals can be confused by the prey-predator relationship and your hunters might not return. Some successes let your take cards from the central play area into your hand if within hand limit.&#10;    Maintain livestock: Pay to keep the animals you've already domesticated.&#10;    Take elder actions: Examples include invention, domestication, proselytization, and witch-burning. If you have no elders, you can convert to monotheism.&#10;&#10;Depending on each player's ending theistic worldview, he has a variable scoring based on successful hunts (polytheism) or resource gathering (monotheism).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The Lion of Khartoum: Gordon's Last Stand&quot; , designed by Jacques Rabier, is a solitaire, card-driven board wargame of strategy and resource management about the siege of Khartoum from February 1884 to January 1885. The player assumes the role of Major-General Charles &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; Gordon, Governor and self-appointed defender of Khartoum, besieged by the Mahdi's Dervish rebel forces. As the Player, you will have to use your few military units and meager resources skillfully to hold out long enough for British relief forces to come to the rescue&hellip;or gloriously die like Gordon himself did.&#10;&#10;The game is not intended to be a totally accurate simulation of the siege of Khartoum but is meant to create an interactive narrative and gaming experience in which the Player is required to make crucial decisions to have any chance of protecting the city and its inhabitants from the wrath of the Dervishes. The Player must improve the city&rsquo;s fortifications, build makeshift Gunboats, mount daring raids and sorties, and tactically respond with military units and leaders to prevent the Mahdi's army from capturing key city defensive locations and, ultimately, the Governor&rsquo;s Palace. All the while, you must manage to keep up the city&rsquo;s morale in the face of adverse events and the continuing effects of the siege.&#10;&#10;Are you up to the challenge, Gordon Pasha?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Slay one of each type of Monster and you win! Watch Out, others will be attacking you. Don&rsquo;t get bitten or you turn into a Monster and start biting others. Plot your strategy to use magical objects, spells, and weapons to battle Monsters, defend yourself, or become human again.&#10;&#10;There are six types of cards in the Bite-Me Deck. (Infection, Attack, Protection, Regeneration, Strength, and Movement cards). Many cards are specific to a species (Human, Vampire, Werewolf, Zombie). You can try to turn other players into a monster with an infection card. Use attack cards to try and kill another players. You can protect yourself from an infection or an attack with the right protection card. Turn back to Human or regain a life with right regeneration card.  Make yourself stronger or others weaker with Strength cards. Change direction or skip players with Movement cards.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game as a Human. Each player will probably change species several times during a game. When a player attacks another with an attack card, it is a battle to survive. Think of the old card game war. If you are attacked with a level 1 attack card, you can fight back with a higher level attack card. This goes on until a player wins or a protection card is played. If you do not have a higher level attack or protection card, you die and your opponent get credit for killing your type of monster. Strength cards can add +1 to your cards or can lower your opponent&rsquo;s cards for one turn. The other type of battle in Bite-Me is called an Alpha Battle. This happens each time more than one player becomes the same monster type. IE when a second person is turned into a Vampire. The victor is the Alpha and takes a card from the loser. They both continue with +1 and -1 cards until they turn into another species. Kill each monster type and be human or be the last surviving player and you WIN!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The art, themes, and imagery in the game may be disturbing and are not deemed appropriate for children.&#10;&#10;Sublime Dark is played over a series of connected games, or delves, which together make up a campaign. In each Delve, the Caro must explore as far as they can, and survive for as long as possible, discovering and uncovering clues and relics as they go, all while evading the horrendous, murderous entities called Eremites, which stalk Blackfell. Each scenario links to the next one to gradually reveal a larger story (and sometimes new game elements) about the world of Sublime Dark.&#10;&#10;In Sublime Dark players take turns to play an action, such as moving to a new area, exploring their current location, uncovering mysteries, hiding from various dangers, solving puzzles, and collecting items and resources to help them defeat the scenario's objectives before time runs out or before they die in the attempt.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Blackfell.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NECNON is not exactly a single game, but more accurately a constellation of games, played according to a pair of complementary protocols. If that sounds complicated, the truth is actually quite otherwise.&#10;&#10;The twin protocols, NEC and NON, are acronyms for 'Not Even Close' and 'No Odd Neighbours'. The difference between them, as their names quirkily suggest, is that in NEC you may never lay a stone next to an even number of enemy stones, whereas in NON it&rsquo;s odd numbers that are off limits. Either way, a placement next to no enemy stones at all is fine.&#10;&#10;NECNON is a very close cousin to the classic game of Go. Contributing stones alternately to a grid whose cells may be either hexagonal or square, the players (Black and Green) gradually fill up the playing space. The objective is to deprive enemy groups (including enemy singletons) of &lsquo;air&rsquo; &ndash; i.e., of the vacant adjacent cells which in Go would be called &lsquo;liberties&rsquo;. At the end, any groups thus &lsquo;smothered&rsquo; score points for the smotherer at the rate of one per stone, and the player with more points wins. If scores are level the game is drawn.&#10;&#10;Note: NECNON is a pure placement game; no capturing occurs during play.&#10;&#10;A great deal of variety stems from a series of decisions made before play begins: whether to choose hexagons or squares; what size of board to use; and whether to go for NEC, or NON, or NEC versus NON. In all cases, Black (who starts) lays one stone on the initially empty board, and thereafter both players lay two at every turn. Passing is only permitted if unavoidable, and the game ends when both players pass consecutively, or when the board is full.  That&rsquo;s it.&#10;&#10;Play NECNON online against a human or a virtual opponent at Stephen Tavener&rsquo;s wonderful Ai Ai site: http://mrraow.com/.index.php/aiai-home/aiai/ .&#10;&#10;",

Players play intrepid Characters from the Island who are preparing to venture into the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean, at the calling of their Ariki (Chief), following the tale of a navigator that returned from sea with stories of the Great Fish of Maui.&#10;&#10;Players will play as a small wh&#196;&#129;nau (family), within the story. They will work to build Waka Hourua (seafaring boats) and their wh&#196;&#129;nau Mana, while following the Seasons and the Atua (Gods) that drive them. Players move three Meeples representing three generations of the wh&#196;&#129;nau around an Island, collecting resources and building their technology.&#10;&#10;The game uses an asynchronous game ending mechanic, meaning Players can finish earlier than others, but risk missing out on building bigger, and better Waka Hourua. Additionally, when playing as a game series, Players order of completion in OCEANS translates directly to the starting order of ISLANDS, providing a connected narrative between the games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

'Iconoclash' captures the fast paced action and tactics of a platform fighter.   Choose your favorite character from a variety of board game universes. Each character has a unique deck and playstyle. Then select which map to fight on.&#10;&#10;Each turn you&rsquo;ll play two attacks, each with three different effects to choose from. Meaning that every character has over 500 unique attack combinations. Some attack options require you to spend a Power Token, giving them an added kick to deal massive damage. Attacks also send your opponents flying, potentially launching them off the edge of the board to deal extra damage. All the while, you will move across the stage to keep your opponent in range, dodge stage hazards, collect items, and avoid attacks. Reduce your opponent's HP to 0 to win.&#10;&#10;Featuring three Multiplayer Modes for up to 4 players:&#10;Classic Mode: Last one-standing wins. This mode is for players who love the classic no-holds-barred, last-one-standing action.&#10;Battle Royale: The player to deal the most damage after 4 rounds wins.

    "Description": "You think you know music? You think you can recognize songs faster than your friends? Then prove it and Grab the Mike! The only game that tests your music knowledge, reaction time and singing ability (or lack thereof)! Cards are drawn to select music genres; whatever genre is revealed is then played on your favorite streaming radio app or played on your smart home speaker.  Once the song starts, the first person that recognizes the song Grabs the Mike and attempts to sing at least the first two lines of the song correctly. Know more than the first two lines? Then keep singing for more points.  The rest of the group judges you on how well you know the song and awards points accordingly. Or, use a pass chip and make any other player attempt said song. In the deck there are also spoiler cards, where you may have to sing a duet or the whole group may have to get up and sing as a choir. Fast-paced, addictive party game that is fun for all ages!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In this game you become crewmembers lost in the Goo Nebula, attempting to repair a small ship before time runs out. Little handmade goo monsters of various colours and levels of deadliness seep on board: you must hunt through the junk on board to find the repair parts for your engine, then race to the bridge and warp to safety! Randomised ship layouts and a random deck of playing cards representing the stuff on board mean that each game is different, but always fun and challenging!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Smok Wawelski is a dexterity game for children (with a light tactical element) based on the Polish fable of the Wawel Dragon (in Polish: Smok Wawelski), one of the legendary stories that describes the beginnings of the Polish state.&#10;&#10;The Wawel Dragon persecutes the castle of King Krak. Many brave warriors and the heroic knights are trying to dash out the terrifying beast, alas, with no result! A clever plan is needed for such a monster. Shoemaker Skub just came up with this one.&#10;&#10;Place the cardboard dragon in the middle of the table, then place the cardboard knights on his tail. Now, the goal of the game is to tilt the figurine to the surface the game is played on. The model works like a two-arm lever. Under certain load on the head side it plummets to the table.&#10;&#10;Go on and help the artful craftsman to implement his plan! On your turn:&#10;&#10;1. Roll the dice.&#10;2. The result of the roll allows you to take off one knight from the dragon&rsquo;s tail or to put an artificial domestic animal (like cow or sheep stuffed with tar and sulfur) into the dragon&rsquo;s mouth.&#10;3. By adding or removing figurines, you attempt to plummet the dragon to the table. If you managed to do so, you win! You may imagine that the monster &mdash; like in the legend &mdash; begins to drink water from the Vistula river&hellip;&#10;&#10;",
