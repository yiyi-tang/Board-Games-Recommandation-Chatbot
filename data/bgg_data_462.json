    "Description": "Survival of the Fittest is a fanboy retelling of the Battle Royale saga. In the game, a class of international students are ferried over to a deserted island by a teacher on a field trip. Unfortunately for them, the teacher is a big fan of the novel &quot;Battle Royale&quot;. Once the students awake on the island, their biggest fears are realized: There is only one way off the island - to be the last one standing. Kill or be killed, true survival of the fittest.&#10;&#10;Intended as a party game, Survival of the Fittest mixes together hand-management and bluffing of Bang! with the second guessing and alliances of Werewolf, bringing in up to 12 players to play as twelve of the fourteen unique characters which are dealt out randomly (along with a starting weapon) to the players.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players secretly (or openly!) choose one of the twelve map co-ordinates to go to that turn, each space giving different advantages (an extra health, a new melee weapon). However, once there, it's time for action! Players ally together to take down other players before turning on their friends. Killing an opponent allows the player to take the weapon, strengthening their own position and in turn making themselves more of a target. However, hiding like a coward is an acceptable tactic, as players can only attack others in the same co-ordinate. With plenty of meta-gaming and whispering going around the table, you can never be sure who to trust!&#10;&#10;As the game goes on, co-ordinates get randomly taken out of play to close down the areas and force confrontation until only one player remains - the fittest, the survivor.&#10;&#10;Designed by Luke Morris and published by Games On The Way, Survival Of The Fittest aims to push itself head first into the big group and party game genre.&#10;&#10;",

It allows complex maneuver similar to standard &quot;measure and move&quot; miniature games, but needs no rulers.  Allows for more dynamic play than hexagonal grids with eight possible positions rather than six.&#10;&#10;Major battles of the era can be played rather quickly, and a small number of troops are needed.  It is an excellent game for beginners to get into the era, and it has enough complexity to keep veteran gamers interested.&#10;&#10;The rules are full color, brief, well written, and easy to follow.  Rule book includes a sample scenario in the back along with scenario building guide and open gaming army development matrix.  Rules include basic and advanced rules, command cards, and quirky illustrations that bring a smile.&#10;&#10;Bottom line is game is fast and entertaining.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Reichshoffen, also known as Froeschwiller or Woerth, was one of France's early disasters in the disastrous Franco-Prussian War. It is most notable for a desperate and futile charge by the French cuirassiers and for a children's song that begins C'&eacute;tait au soir d'la bataille de Reichshoffen.&#10;&#10;The scale of Reichshoffen 1870 is the same as Solferino 1859 (600 meters/hex, 1 hour/turn, units are brigades). The rules vary only slightly: French defensive fire and Prussian artillery are both more effective than in the earlier game, reflecting the two nations' technical advances in small arms and cannon, respectively. French heavy cavalry have two opportunities per game for a charge &agrave; la mort, which can strike anywhere within five hexes of a French headquarters - usually without effect but useful if saved for just the right opportune moment.&#10;&#10;Other rules changes are based on the armies' command problems. The French army has no commander-in-chief. Marshal Mac Mahon, the hero of the Battle of Magenta, &quot;although physically present on the battlefield did not direct the battle&quot;. As a consequence, French formations can act effectively only by passing initiative tests. (Optional rules give the Marshal a chance to be slightly or fully effective.) On the Prussian side, there was quite a lot of initial confusion; brigades cannot launch coordinated attacks until the commander-in-chief, Prince Frederick William, arrives on the scene halfway through the action.&#10;&#10;The battle begins at 8:30 am and lasts for 10 hourly turns. The victory conditions are simple: The Prussians must occupy four villages in the center of the map; otherwise the French win. The map is slightly less than half the old Vae Victis standard, sharing a sheet with the one for Magenta 1859. The counters must be mounted and cut apart.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Magenta, June 4, 1859, was the first major clash between France and Austria during the Second Italian War of Independence. Magenta 1859 recreates it using the same rules as Solferino 1859 and Reichshoffen 1870, as well as the same scale (one hour per turn, 600 meters per hex, brigades). Unlike its siblings, the game has almost no special rules.&#10;&#10;Napoleon III commands the French and, though scarcely comparable to his uncle, well overmatches the Austrians' sluggish and late arriving Count Gyulai. Unfortunately for the French, Napoleon enters far away from the bulk of his forces and takes a long time to get within command range. Until then, formations may move effectively only when their commanders make successful initiative rolls, and the largest French corps suffers from an initiative penalty for the first several hours. (Its commander, General Mac Mahon, moved slowly while waiting for a Sardinian division to come up to cover his open flank. This caution did not, however, prevent him from becoming the hero of the day. The Emperor rewarded him with the title &quot;duc de Magenta&quot;.)&#10;&#10;The battle starts at 10:00 a.m. and lasts 10 turns, with many brigades not arriving until the afternoon. The forces (and the map) are only about half the size of those in Solferino, and the victory conditions are simpler: Each side gets one Victory Point for each hex it holds in the town of Magenta (which has three) plus one for each demoralized enemy corps.&#10;&#10;",

It also considers rockets, which were frequently employed in the close support role during street fighting and 'bunker busting' operations along with various other weapons.&#10;&#10;A ready reference section is provided to maintain the flow of play when major aspects of the various procedures need to be confirmed. A section is also presented dealing with defensive works along with scenario ideas and tactical information relating to attacks made against them.&#10;&#10;",

Larger scenarios might involve amphibious landings in the Mediterranean or 'island hopping' in the Pacific. On a more routine level, the various sections of this volume can be employed to provide air and 'off table' artillery support during predominantly land actions. Similarly, come of the specialized combat engineering vehicles developed for the Normandy landings can be used to assist in overcoming difficulties further inland, as occurred in the actual conflict. In common with its companion titles, Kampfgurppe Vier is fully compatible with all other aspects of the'Kampfgruppe' system and can be employed fully, or in part, to suit the specific requirements of players.&#10;&#10;",

The result will seem familiar to players of these first games, but in many of the mechanisms and details there has been change.&#10;&#10;The changes have made for standardized systems, which are both easy to teach and remember in play. The text is clearer with more and better examples. It has also been organized by a group of players like yourself, so hopefully finding information in a hurry will be easier.&#10;&#10;BoF II continues as a leading miniature skirmish game, for games of Squads up to reinforced Platoon level from WW2 to present day. It includes rules for all manner of infantry and vehicle operations. There are additional optional rules to further enhance the gaming experience.&#10;&#10;The rules are aimed to create as authentic a battlefield experience as possible, players are encouraged to utilize real life battlefield strategies and tactics as these will give great success.&#10;&#10;BoF II continues using a similar system as Baptism of Fire and Wild Fire to create a highly interactive, unpredictable, yet the player can try and exert a degree of control and planning to implement his strategies and tactics.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the intro:&#10;&#10;&quot;Rattenkrieg&quot; is designed as a stand alone game system that allows players to recreate fighting in built up areas during the Second World War. However, because it is based on the popular, tried and tested 'Kampfgruppe' series it is also compatible with the rest of Dropwing's World War Two titles, allowing scenarios of infinite variety to be created.&#10;&#10;Urban fighting is held by many to be one of the most challenging aspects of modern warfare and this is equally reflected by the challenge of representing such combat on the war games table. This volume enables various types of infantry and vehicles to test their mettle against some of the unique situations to be encountered whilst fighting in built up areas.&#10;&#10;Some of the most significant battles of the Second World War were fought in urban surroundings, such as Berlin, the Warsaw Uprising and perhaps most notably Stalingrad. However, it should also be remembered that, in addition to such epic and historically significant encounters, countless smaller actions took place within the towns and villages along the paths of advance made at all stages of the war. The prime purpose of &quot;Rattenkrieg&quot; is to enable this style of combat, along with its unique atmosphere and challenges, to be recreated on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;Special procedures are presented to incorporate sniper duels, sewer fighters and tank hunting teams, in addition to more mainstream combatants. Ready reference sheets are printed on facing pages and due to the comb binding the book can be opened flat to speed up play by having all of the main procedures available at a glance.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rattenkrieg&quot; also includes a scenario based on an historical event, which can be used to introduce new players to the game as well as form a basis for experiment with various aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Road Cycling Tour (RCT) is a road cycling simulation focusing on team tactics in multi-stage races. By means of road/track tiles stages can be built to simulate real or imaginary cycling events. Movement is modified roll-and-move with some additional rules for breakaways and closing gaps (as a simulation of slipstreaming). The characteristics or qualities of the cyclists/riders are represented with 'speed counters' that can be used to replace or in addition to the dice. Teams should generally have a balanced mix of riders with different specializations represented by different sets of speed counters.&#10;&#10;A 'beginners' game' and rules for time trials, team time trials, and some advanced and optional rules are included with the game, but given the flexible nature of the game, players can easily make further adaptations to simulate their favorite cycling event. To further explain the most complex rules, a series of picture tutorials can be found in the 'rules forum' here.&#10;&#10;RCT is not a short game. It is recommended to play at least 5 stages in a single game, and with 2 experienced players, that would take between 2 and 3 hours. More players and more (and/or longer) stages make the game longer, smaller teams make it shorter but have a negative effect on possible team tactics. However, RCT is played stage by stage, and it would be easy to play different stages on different occasions.&#10;&#10;The game is a free download. All necessary files are available in the files section here.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An interactive children's memory game.  Taking turns each player tries to find a matching 'Crazy Creature' which matches the Hide and Seek card.  If a player successfully finds a match they can move 'IT' one space closer to their opponents Gotcha circle.  When 'IT' reaches either players Gotcha circle the other player is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game simulates a game of hide and seek and allows the players to interact with each other using phrases like 'You're it' and 'Gotcha'.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Find the hidden creatures to win this easy to play memory game.&#10;For 2 players aged 4 years upwards&#10;&#10;A game for 2 players aged 4 onwards.&#10;OBJECT:&#10;To keep out of the CAUGHT YOU space by selecting the correct hiding Crazy Creature.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION:&#10;1. Place the playing strip on the table with the yellow CAUGHT YOU space in front of one player sitting one side of the table and the blue CAUGHT YOU space in front of the other, sitting opposite.&#10;2. Attach MR. IT to his stand and place him on the start facing the yellow end of the playing strip.&#10;3. The player at the yellow and of the playing strip takes the eight HIDING PLACE cards with the yellow sky and places them lace (CRAZY CREATURE SIDE) down spread out in a straight line in front of him. The player at the blue and does the same with the blue cards.&#10;4. The Crazy Creature cards are shuffled and stacked face down on the table between the two rows of HIDING PLACE cards.&#10;5. The top Crazy Creature card is turned over, showing the players which creature they are looking for, and the game i.e. ready to begin.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;The player on the yellow side of the playing strip starts by reaching over and turning one of his opponent's HIDING PLACE cards over to find the Crazy Creature of the same colour as on the card in the centre. If the creature on the HIDING PLACE card does not match he turns the &quot;HIDING PLACE&quot; card back over and his turn ends. The player on the blue side now turns one of his opponent&rsquo;: HIDING PLACE cards to find the same Crazy Creature.&#10;When a player turns a HIDING PLACE card and finds the matching Crazy Creature, he yells YOU'RE IT and turns MR. IT to face his opponent and moves MR. lT one step towards his opponent's CAUGHT YOU space. The hiding place card is left face up. He then turns over a new Crazy Creature card in the centre and goes again, looking for the next Crazy Creature.&#10;If all 8 Crazy Creature cards in the centre have been turned over before MR. IT gets to a CAUGHT YOU space, the Crazy Creature cards are re-shuffled and placed face down between the players. The players then turn all hiding place cards Crazy Creature side down and rearrange them. The last player to find the hiding Crazy Creature continues the play and turns over the top Crazy Creature card in the centre.&#10;&#10;When a player moves MR. IT into his opponent's CAUGHT YOU space, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

All players are dealt five cards.  One player begins as the caller and turns over the top card in the deck.  She then choses one of the three numbers on that card and &quot;calls&quot; that number.  For instance O-43.  Any players who have cards that match that number can play them in front of them and draw a new card.  The caller does have a hand and can choose the number to call based on their cards.  Play proceeds until a FREE card is drawn.  When this happens the caller plays it as her own and any other FREE card is discarded, the deck then moves to the player on the left and they become the caller.&#10;&#10;",

In reality the conflict was averted by the French need of British support against German aggression, but in Admiral it blooms out with a major naval engagement around southern Africa.&#10;&#10;Each player controls three ship fleets, consisting of submarines, destroyers and cruisers. Each fleet has a command ship and a command base. If the command ship is sunk or the base is invaded the entire fleet is destroyed and its ships removed. Each player also controls a battleship which commands the entire fleet, and a corresponding fleet base. Sinking the opponents battleship or invading his fleet base wins the game.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player may move one ship from each fleet or forgo moving one fleet in order to move the battleship instead. Ships move along the corners of the hexes, submarines in the hexes. Subs can sink cruisers and battleships, destroyers can sink subs, cruisers can sink destroyers and battleships can sink both cruisers and destroyers.&#10;&#10;Admiral plays out similar to chess, a chess with four kings, an action point allowance system and a rock-paper-scissors capture mechanism.&#10;&#10;The publisher claims Admiral to be playable by 2-6 players but in reality it is a pure two player game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A memory game loosely based on Eric Carle's Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? and Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See? series of children's books.&#10;&#10;2-4 players are either brown or panda bears; the pandas are looking for a set of endangered animals, while the browns are looking for a set of more mundane wildlife (albeit a bit weird, such as the blue horse).  Each turn a player flips one tile from a center pool.  If it fills an opening in their predefined set, they keep it and take one (and only one) more turn.  If not, they turn it back over.  First player to fill their whole set wins.&#10;&#10;The two turn limit makes this more suited to very young children than traditional memory games, as there's never too many recently-flipped tiles to track.  Most of the time there's either zero or one, since rejected animals are usually quickly picked up by the next player in line.&#10;&#10;Claims that the game helps with sequencing skills are based on the endgame, when the winning player calls out each of their animals in order, aping the book series' style.  (The animals can be picked up in any order.)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spear Song is a set of tabletop wargame rules primarily based on the Dark Age/Medieval period. By concentrating on the 'mechanics' of pre-gunpowder warfare, rather than focusing on particular armies or battles, the system should be flexible enough to cater for the historical preferences of most players who are interested in this era. Rules for chariots and 'Eastern style' warriors further increase the potential by allowing for Celtic or Crusader type settings.&#10;&#10;Whilst the rules are mainly designed to create skirmishes and small-scale actions, a section is also included to enable larger scale battles to be fought using the same basic system.&#10;&#10;Each major section of the text is followed by a fictional narrative that explains how the system works in game terms, and an introductory scenario based around the narratives is provided to familiarize players with the game.&#10;&#10;As with other Dropwing systems, it is intended to extend the historical material that we produce in line with market demand. Having said this, Spear Song provides a 'stand alone' system in it's own right, which provides players with the basic material to fight battles using a wide variety of warriors from the 'Sword and Shield' era.&#10;&#10;",

Players try to make 2 5-in-a-rows by placing their tokens, blocking and removing enemy tokens.&#10;Tremplin: a chinese checkers sort of game where players try to reach their respective goals by jumping over pieces. (2 configurations: for 2 or 4 players)&#10;Arriba: an original concept where the board is positioned at an angle. Players try to reach the top row but the holes become deeper and deeper towards it, so multiple tokens have to be positioned in the holes to create stepping stones.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s particularly hard to define where the &ldquo;real&rdquo; ends and the &ldquo;fictional&rdquo; begins. For those of you who follow military and scientific matters, you&rsquo;re likely to spot where reality meets fiction-although in some cases, you may not be able to clearly distinguish between these boundaries. However, it really isn't important where the lines blur a bit. The fuzzy area where reality and fiction intermix is intentional. The real fun is in the game itself and what you can (or can&rsquo;t) make of it to be successful in your mission and/or goals!&#10;&#10;You can play T5 strictly as a miniatures game, a roleplaying game, or both simultaneously. As you will see, the Character Profile Log sheets can be filled out and set up to use either way, depending upon the amount of information you want to know, or need to have, about a character. The game can easily be converted into a dual miniatures/roleplaying game simply by choosing to play one character as yourself while the rest of your team (Strike Cell) is played normally as miniatures would be.&#10;&#10;T5 is excellent for present-day combat simulation gaming too! The unique and versatile Com20 game system mechanics give you everything you need to game battles taking place today--with no modifications necessary! See the T5 Action! page for additional details.&#10;&#10;",

Set-up, by alternate picking of territories, and die roll combat is identical to Risk. The came contains 153 cards (infantry, cavalry, and &quot;governor&quot; cards for each of the 51 territories), and card play is significantly different from Risk, as a card from a stack of shuffled infantry and cavalry cards is picked every time a territory is conquered. If a player acquires both the infantry and cavalry cards for a state, the player is awarded the governor card for that state and immediately takes that state over. If another player has the other card, there is a one-die showdown to determine control. Play continues until all 102 infantry/cavalry cards are drawn, and the winner is the player with the most territories at that time. The game is well-made, with front &amp; back box printing, a mounted board, plastic insert, 153 cards, 6 dice, 4 sets of 64 plastic chips, and three rules booklets (English, Spanish, French).&#10;&#10;",
