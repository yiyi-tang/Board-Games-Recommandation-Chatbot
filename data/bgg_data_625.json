    "Description": "Nickel &amp; Dime Pool is a dexterity, flicking game based on pool. Coins are used in place of balls. They are &quot;flicked&quot; with your finger instead of using a pool cue. A larger, nickel-sized coin is used as the cue ball and 10 dime-sized coins represent the rest of the balls. The small coins are split into 2 groups, solids and stripes. One player/team uses solids, numbered 1-5, the other uses stripes, numbered 6-10. The goal is to be the first player/team to sink all of their respective coins into the pockets. The board is square, molded plastic with 6 pockets. 1 at each of the 4 corners and 1 one along either side midway down the board. Just like billiards, the cue coin is used to sink the other coins into the pockets by flicking it into the numbered coins.&#10;&#10;Game comes with board, 11 coins, plastic triangular rack and vinyl pouch to hold coins. Vinyl decals are supplied to apply to the coins, representing the different numbered balls, 1-10.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the world of Mt. Kilajava, the first board game from Christchurch-based Monsoon Games that combines the spirit of competitive gaming with a rare insight into the realities of  global trade.&#10;&#10;You have arrived at the slopes of Mt Kilajava, a bare but fertile volcano, to establish a coffee farm. Your opponent arrives at the same moment, and has the same idea... The race is on! Who can successfully grow more coffee on the land available?&#10;&#10;This is a fun, strategy-based board game for two players. Unfolding events maintain the suspense until the very end - storms, eruptions and price crashes will claim a lot of coffee along the way.&#10;&#10;Mt. Kilajava also makes an important point; that for farmers in the developing world growing coffee is a very precarious occupation, and slumps in world coffee prices can and do have a catastrophic effect on the lives of millions of growers who are reliant on coffee for their income.&#10;&#10;With some skill, daring and a measure of good luck you can enjoy watching your opponent lose their coffee to plummeting world prices.  On the way you will also gain an insight into the real story behind your double shot cappuccino.&#10;&#10;&quot;Games first and foremost have to be fun to play, but I think they can also help us better understand and appreciate the world around us,&quot; says creator (and Trade Aid coffee buyer) Justin Purser.&#10;&#10;",

The game board has a slider to keep track of stock prices, allowing for variability between plays. Players move about the board by rolling dice, but different places offer different movement, depending on what was rolled (an even or odd for example.) Players buy and sell stock as the game progresses - there is no credit allowed in the game so if a player runs out of money then he or she is eliminated. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A new game from the makers of Booleo, this time covering organic Chemistry.&#10;&#10;CHem-eO is a fun card game for two or more players, which demonstrates basic organic chemistry fundamentals. Players compete to build complex and simple compounds from individual atoms.  Points are scored upon completing each molecule.  Players may choose to play to any score they wish - a suggested goal is 92, which is the atomic number of Uranium (the heaviest naturally occurring element).  If the player would like a longer game then an alternate goal could be the atomic number of the heaviest element currently discovered.  Players scores are kept on the periodic table of element.  Play as Carbon(Solid), Oxygen(liquid), Helium(Gas), or Nitrogen(Unknown).&#10;&#10;The points scored as players finish building compounds come in two varieties: simple and complex.  Simple compounds are common compounds which are made up of relatively few atoms.  Complex compound are designated as such; either because they consist of more atoms and bonds, or because they are less well known. Complex compounds have the added difficulty of requiring the recipe card to complete.  This also earns the player bonus points.&#10;&#10;Once a compound is started it can be completed by any player which means a compound you start out to be Methane (a simple compound) may be turned into Acetic Acid (a complex compound) requiring a recipe.&#10;&#10;Cards include single, double and triple bonds, elements, and recipes for compounds.  Play is fast paced and allows the players to learn about organic chemistry while they play this fun interactive game.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to eliminate your opponents' warriors by strategically attacking them with your men. To accomplish this, you must engage the services of the neutral team (also called the Robot Team). Beware! Because your opponent gains control of the neutral robots on his turn. Both opponents move toward the center power source. Here they many choose to regenerate their forces or decide upon a strategic super attack. Look out! The unseen move can propel you or destroy you. Never give up... comebacks are always possible. Maybe you will be the next TRILOGY master.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player gets a team of six markers, and there is a third &quot;team,&quot; that is the neutral robot. Each turn, players can move one of their pieces and one of the robot pieces. Pieces can move or jump other pieces. Jumping an opponents' piece or a robot piece eliminates that piece. Moving to the center dot on the board allows a player to generate another piece or take an extra turn. The first player to eliminate the opponent's team wins.&#10;&#10;Published by &quot;Ellis and Frazier Games&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Players then take turns drawing from the &quot;Trade&quot; pile, which allows them to turn over cards and trade them with other players' cards, as well as mix up theirs or someone else's hand, or trade with the draw pile.

Whoever plays one of the city cards takes the corresponding chips unless the catastrophe card has been played in which case the player who first gets rid of all his cards receive one chip from each other player for every card remaining in his hand. The pots remain and added to for the next round.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The velocity of the ball, the awful physics of the track ... and in the middle of it all, men.  Playing by an odd set of rules. It's not a game man was supposed to grow strong in...&quot;&#10;&#10;Those of you who enjoyed the 1975 movie &quot;Rollerball&quot; will want to take a look at this re-creation of the violent future sport ... as a board game. You&rsquo;ll have to use all the speed of the track to overcome your opponents and force your way through to the goal with that heartless steel ball.&#10;&#10;Each player manages his team of skaters, catchers and bikers in an effort to score goals with the ball. Each member of the team is represented by a counter (or figure), with vital information recorded on a separate card. The speed of movement is recorded with a sliding clip on the side of the card, and adjusted turn by turn as the figures race around the track. The player must pull order out of chaos as his team struggles with opponents to control the ball and score goals.&#10;&#10;The movement of figures is affected by the speed and agility of the figure. Complex manuevers, interactions with opposing figures (such as striking and checking) and handling the ball are resolved with dice rolls. As the game progresses, injuries and fatigue will reduce the effectiveness of the team, and play strategy includes decisions about protecting key figures and targeting particular opponents in this full contact sport.&#10;&#10;Playing time is extremely long. This is a simulation game requiring book-keeping and attention to detail. Not for everyone.&#10;&#10;Game variants allow modified game constraints such as &quot;no penalties&quot; or changes to the time limit.&#10;&#10;Free to download from the files section below.&#10;&#10;This is fan work.

Jokers cannot be led unless there are no other cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The score is always 10 points plus the number of tricks won by the soloist (making anything from 10 to 24 points).

For authenticity, in the game each of side uses the exact forces available to it on 18 August, bombers and fighters move across the map at the same rate as did the real aircraft during the Battle and each contestant has operational orders and directives similar to those of his real counterpart during this phase of the Battle of Britain. The players control pieces representing each British fighter squadron, and forces from each German bomber and fighter Geschwader, in their struggle for air superiority over the vitally important south eastern corner of England. The rules of the game have been carefully worked out to present a series of actions remarkably close to those actually fought during the Battle of Britain. With tactical skill and element of good fortune, either side can win. Devised by Dr. Alfred Price and Mike Spick.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Escaping to the stars was Humanity's solution, settling in space colonies all around the Solar System. Under the banner of Corpnations, the new post-Humanity has forgotten almost everything form its time on Earth, only having to turn back as a strange energy grows in their old home planet...&#10;&#10;Mekawing is a Mecha Tactical Board Game in which two opposing wings battle each other in different scenarios.&#10;&#10;Providing a total Cinematic Experience, Mekawing mixes the detail of miniature gaming, and the action/counter-action of card gaming to create a unique gaming experience. This is done with both wing creation and deck construction rules and mechanics.&#10;&#10;Each player picks their Ace pilots which provide Wing Points from which they buy mechs - Mekas - for their wings. Players have three factions to play, each faction providing a selection of meka types and equipment configurations; focusing on melee combat, ranged combat, or special support.&#10;&#10;Additionally, each player builds his/her own Duel decks with cards that show each meka's fighting style, and Upgrade cards that grant special actions and abilities to their Mekas, provide bonuses and/or create special battle situations; giving each wing its own tactics and strategies.&#10;&#10;During play, players choose a scenario, build the map using terrain tiles, and use their mekas to gain control of the battleground using their meka's equipment and Action Cards.&#10;&#10;Want to now the story behind Mekawing? go to https://mekawing.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/ficcion-mekawing-regimen-de-la-colmena-wan-yang/ (content in spanish).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "New colonies need many things to survive... tools, food, raw materials, medicine, to name a few. Merchants and the ships they use to ply the stars are their salvation in many ways. You are one of those merchants. You are charged with ensuring that you are not only profitable, but you are keeping these new colonies alive and thriving in this backwater part of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;You also have competitors... others who wish to attract the attention of the Emperor by being the best. You must struggle to supply systems with goods at a profit. You must also struggle to gain influence through your trade in key systems that will attract future rewards from the Emperor himself. But options are limited... you don&rsquo;t hear of deliveries when needed and your opponents do.&#10;&#10;You are beset with a changing political landscape in this sector as colonies grow. Demand for certain goods shifts like sand. Danger and discovery await. Your network of informants and insiders provide you with information. As time passes, it becomes harder to trade safely as success attracts attention &mdash; sometimes from unsavory characters. The finest merchants rise to this challenge, but they are ever-mindful of not making the Emperor jealous...&#10;&#10;THIS is life in Right Ascension...&#10;&#10;",

Example: When the first player spins the spinner and gets the letter &quot;B&quot; he thinks of a word (board), so now he says out loud the second letter in that word &quot;O&quot;, the next player now builds on from those two letters, but thinks of another word (Boulder) and says out loud the next letter in that word &quot;U&quot;. Etc. Play continues until a player cannot add a letter or only has the option to add the final letter to make a complete word.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Looking to get out a little pent-up aggression but don't feel like destroying your flatware? Plunk-A-Skunk is for you. Fans of the Whack-A-Mole carnival game found on Jersey Shore boardwalks will be familiar with this game's manic bonking action. As each of the skunk heads on the playing field light up you have to ding them with the padded Plunk-A-Skunk mallet to score points. Bang away and skunks taunt and praise you with phrases like &quot;Time is running out&quot; and &quot;You're awesome.&quot;&#10;&#10;Electronic game, home variant of the popular arcade/funfair game where small creatures (usually crocodiles or gophers) pop in and out of holes in the board, and the players score points by hitting (&quot;plunking&quot;) them with inflatable mallets. This variant uses skunk faces that randomly light up; the player scores points by hitting a skunk face when it is illuminated.&#10;&#10;Mildly amusing fun, with limited replay value, and fresh batteries are a must.&#10;&#10;",
