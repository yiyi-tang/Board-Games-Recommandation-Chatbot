    "Description": "During a routine reconnaissance mission over the Gobi desert during WW2, a strange and sudden loss of flight controls renders your aircraft downed and in flames...&#10;&#10;Surviving the crash is only the start of your epic struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;Whilst swiftly salvaging what you can from the burning wreckage, you realise you are very alone and at the mercy of the elements and whatever else may lurk here.&#10;&#10;Survival will not be easy, but you make your way out into the desert expanse, in the hope of finding civilisation, sanctuary.....and survival.&#10;&#10;Mirage is a lightweight, fun, solo adventure card game, partly inspired by the retro classic text based adventure video games of old and with lovingly drawn art. Its a great game for when you need that quick gaming fix as it sets up and plays in as little as 10 - 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;In Mirage, you must survive for six days. Search the Gobi Desert by placing your 'Exploration Tokens' at specific areas and resolving 'Exploration' cards . These will either be helpful or harmful locations, useful items or dangerous enemy encounters.&#10;&#10;Choose areas wisely, as exploring the same place will have a smaller effect on your stats, .....BUT, cause you to be ambushed by a stalking enemy. Searching further afield has a more detrimental effect on your stats but you are not subject to the punishing ambush attack.&#10;&#10;Manage your vital stats of Health, Water and Stamina in order to stay alive. Adapt your strategy based on your current stats and items at hand.&#10;&#10;As well as the 'Standard' game challenge, you can play as one of several realistic Royal Air Force characters to further bring the game to life. Each character comes with specific starting items and stats. The 'Epic' level challenge will certainly keep you tested to the max!!&#10;&#10;Welcome to the first in the Survival Series.....welcome to Mirage!.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, access to this terrifying knowledge comes with a cost, as you will have to sacrifice your units to feed the Beyond. By doing so, you'll sink into putrefaction, lose more and more prestige over your opponents, and even part with your precious victory points. This is the price to pay for access to such fearsome abilities and the most frightening of possibilities. Perhaps you will learn to summon the monstrous Apophis, a being of pure evil that dwells in the Underworld. Perhaps you can bend the all-knowing Thoth, the repository of the dark knowledge, to your will. If you are prepared to pay the high price for consorting with such dark forces, they will be formidable allies in your conquest of the black lands of Kemet: Blood and Sand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Build your tenun fabric enterprise from the design, collaboration, production, and commercial side of each player role. Manage fluctuating budgets within the company and lead your establishment to become the best tenun fabric producer!&#10;&#10;The game spans within 12 turns, and at the beginning of every turn, roll 5 investor dice. The value of dice is the budget for that turn and is shared for every division within the company. Budget allocation for each division should be considered very carefully as each division has their own needs. The value in a dice is exact and cannot be split, and must be spent without leftovers.&#10;&#10;Each player within the company has a pivotal role to ensure the company&rsquo;s best interest. Executive role is in charge of action points management for each division, hiring new employees, and training them. Operation role is in charge of designing fabric, quality improvement, and material acquisition. Marketing role is in charge of engaging new customers, sales, and establishing brick and mortar outlets.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of turn 12. The final score is determined by the amount of earnings gained reduced by the amount of expense. Milestone achievement for any category also affects positively for the final score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Competitive zombie-themed card game where 3 to 5 players pass through places taken by the living dead trying to survive and fulfill the game's objectives to achieve victory. Each player chooses a survivor with different characteristics and receives at the beginning of the game a goal that is inspired by several films of the genre.&#10;&#10;During the game, players face the undead with the roll of the dice that is also used to activate cards that can be used both for combat and to help them fulfill their secret objectives and win the game.&#10;&#10;Other locations can enter play, symbolizing the path taken by the survivors. The entire turn, players draw a survivor card, which can be actions or equipment (simplifying), and also draw a zombie card, which can be the undead themselves, or some negative event that occurs on the turn. Drawing zombies always stay in the same location, affecting all players who are there. For this reason the more people in the same place, the more dangerous it becomes.&#10;&#10;The combat in the game is performed with the dice roll, where the result is added to the survivor's equipment and skills. Zombies don't roll damage, but they get a bonus for quantity, the more zombies, the more difficult it is. When there is no way to fight the survivors can always escape, which is done in a similar way.&#10;&#10;To win the game they must fulfill their objective cards, which have three tasks each. These activities can be killing a certain number of zombies, being in a certain place or having an item. Each objective is different and they follow a short narrative present in the cards. With the three tasks completed, the game is won, if the survivor manages to stay alive until the end of his turn.&#10;&#10;Journey Z is a game with a lot of interaction between players, and this can be directly or indirectly, as two people in the same place, even just interacting with the zombies, can completely change the other's plans. Manipulate the result of the die roll, or use cards to gain advantages in confrontations with the undead, but the main thing is to be aware of your victory conditions and know how to use your resources to reach it as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;'-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Saturday Legends is the followup game to the highly successful Friday Night Legends. This time, you coach the greatest college football teams of all time against each other based on their actual stats.&#10;&#10;The core of the SL game engine is based on hours of in-depth and meticulous hours of research.&#10;&#10;The game system is elegant in its simplicity that allows you to do what you want to do coach and play games with your college gridiron heroes. Players act as the coach for their chosen team and make all the critical decisions like their real life counterparts do. In a matchup between two players, you each simultaneously select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them. SL's elegance comes from its years of development, using a system of a few simple die rolls and simple math of the addition and subtraction of results when the players look up those results on their respective team sheets. Team tendencies in terms of their breakdown in running vs. passing plays are tracked on the simple score pads. The easy to use individual team chart replicates the strengths and weaknesses of each team. SL's unique and easy to use system enables you to compare and play powerhouse larger schools against the small schools. The fast playing time of 60-90 minutes both allows you to play more games in short order while still capturing the fun and essence of college football.&#10;&#10;The game designers responded with adding more teams across the country and continue to meet that demand from game players with the plans to expand their college football team universe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Cheesy Tosser's a tabletop miniatures game with a fun sporting theme. &#10;Think Bloodbowl meets the middle ages, a football rugby mashup between two opposing villages all with a bit of light hearted fun. &#10;The rules have been written to create a fast paced, easy to learn game especially suitable for a fun evening, club or show game. &#10;These rules are diceless, instead using a deck of standard playing cards to add friction and resolve the mechanics.&#10;Players have a hand of three cards which they can use individually or chain together to activate one or multiple team members. &#10;The aim? to hit the opponents pub with the cheese! &#10;Options for multiplayer and alternate settings also included, along with access to a Tabletop simulator module, player roster and QRS.&#10;&#10;Men and women have been daft for hundreds of years now. Examples of what can happen when boredom, beer and too much sunshine mix can be seen in our countryside culture and folklore. Village games and rivalry date back to the Doomsday book and still hold a place in our national pride. One such tradition and probably the original concept for the games of football and rugby, was the Annual Langtoft and Baston Cheese tossing. It involved teams of locals from each respective village attempting to cover the front of the opposing village&rsquo;s pub in stinking cheese. Often participants were drunk and sometimes dressed inappropriately, we&rsquo;ve all known a village idiot! Records show no one was ever fatally injured, more through luck than judgment. Play continued until everyone was too tired to carry on, had had enough or the landlord of the respective pub could stand the stench no more and offered a truce by way of a wagon load of Badgers Bite Brown Ale and the subsequent piss up to the conquering village. Such fun has even witnessed festive games played using Christmas puddings instead of cheese and decorated hard boiled dragons&rsquo; eggs at Easter!&#10;&#10;You can now recreate this spectacle on your table top as follows. &#10;Silly hats and a pint in hand are optional but recommended.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They also determine at the start of the game how many rounds the game will comprise - 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.&#10;&#10;Player rolls may result in no milage for a pilot's turn due to fog, illness, hijackings, FAA inspections and more, as described on their individual flight schedule.

    "Description": "Blasted Planets Skirmish, is basically a set of house rules a few friends and I use to play games with my Sci-Fi figures. I am not trying to model a &quot;Hard&quot; Sci-Fi environment here. I'm borrowing as much from Horror and Fantasy as I am from Sci-Fi. I mean how serious can you be. When you have, Dog headed, Gator men chasing an Elephant guy around an Omni Field generating White rabbit? There is enough &quot;real&quot; world framework here that basic tactics work (most of the time). But enough of a fantastical element that you really can't count on the idea that the Fin headed alien with the pin gun is going to nail the cave man with the rock every time.&#10;&#10;One thing for sure is I am not even trying to come up with a back story for this nonsense. That of course does not mean that you can't. Half or maybe even more than half of the fun of this game is cooking up an army before the game that that functions in some strange way that will confuse or irritate your opponent. If we had a back-story or universal framework that would on some levels really blow that idea out of the water.&#10;&#10;On another note the rule formatting is kind of weird. I'm not pretending that it is clever, it's just a reflection of the way my mind works and how I make sense out of things. But I think that it is comprehensible to most &quot;Wargamers&quot; the phrasing in some cases is really tortured. You can thank the fact, that several of my buddies are Super competitors, for this. When you run in to a sentence or paragraph that feels like you are creeping through a minefield there is a real good chance some egregious abuse on the table of an earlier phrasing, required some careful phraseology. The guys you play with may not need this sort of structure. But most of the guys I play with are (at least when rules interpretation is concerned) fundamentally evil in nature. I'm not talking about your basic hearty laugh at a handicapped person trying to struggle to their feet in the grocery aisle after a fall from the wheel chair. I'm talking about the type of stuff that ensures most of these guys will probably spend a good part of eternity as consultants at the right hand of Satan himself. By reading the rules especially some, special abilities and the way they can be combined, and looking at my figures you can probably and rightly conclude that I have my own share of disturbing thoughts. But half of the time these guys leave me feeling like I'm Bo Peep in John Wayne Gacey's crawl space. I'm mentioning all this not as an excuse, but as an explanation as to why the rules are written the way that they are. I mean, I have to be able, when these guys try something particularly twisted, to say, &quot;that?s clearly not, what the intention of that rule is.&quot; Of course the easy way out is just always pointing out, that these rules are a perpetually open Beta project.&#10;&#10;So that is why we have the Blasted Planets Forum. I am going to do my best to check in at least every couple of days and try to respond to any questions or ideas you all may have. We have played enough games over the years that I know that with the right approach it is possible to play a game with these rules with out any mid game re writes. That is not to say that there are no re-write artifacts in the rules and that the punctuation all works right. If you run in to a problem and come up with a solution for it, please go ahead and post it to the forum. An important thing to remember though is that with all the possible Special ability combinations it is quite possible to come up with an army that just won't work against the enemy you are facing. No matter how hard you try and no matter how well you roll the dice. If you use 600pt armies on a 4x4 or 4x5 table you can probably knock out a couple of games in an after noon. One thing I have always enjoyed is playing two games with the same armies and table set up but giving each player a chance to play each side. This is especially gratifying if one player has gone in to full on Gloat mode after defeating a thoroughly outclassed opposing army.&#10;&#10;One last thing is a note on terrain; the rules as written cover use of flat top contours for elevation. I know that not every one uses this type of terrain. So Line of site line of fire rules are probably the thing that will most often have to be adapted to whatever you happen to use. I have written no rules for the use of buildings so knock yourself out in that area. I have some nice buildings but have not figured out as way to use them that I like in this type of games. All the other games I play use built up areas rather than individual buildings and I do not think that that fits well with Blasted Planets Skirmish.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of two phases: the Planning Phase and the Execution Phase.&#10;&#10;During the Planning Phase, the player recruits and uses Key Leaders from the KGB, GRU, and the Army to mobilize tactical units for 8 specific targets, collect intelligence, perform special tasks, and conduct rehearsals. Random events and player activities may affect the level of operational support from the Power Ministries, the alert level of the Afghan defenders, and the intelligence available on each target.&#10;&#10;At the conclusion of the Planning Phase, the player starts the Execution Phase. During this phase, the player completes 8 tactical missions with the assigned Key Leaders and tactical units in sequential order on point-2-point maps. A unique version of chit-activation determines initiative to ensure a fluid combat system. The player has at their disposal KGB spetsnaz, GRU special troops, and Airborne (VDV) infantry and armored fighting vehicles.&#10;&#10;Victory points are measured by the views of Politburo, General Staff, GRU, KGB, the Afghan Government, the Afghan people, the United States, and the international community on the operation's outcome.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

FOURTH ESTATE MODULE&#10;&#10;Consists of: Global Media Project * Trends mini-expansion - 6 cards * 3 Treaty cards&#10;&#10;The World: The Global Media Project uses the media to lead the average person to the appropriate points of a view.&#10;&#10;Social-political currents (Trends) usually originate in a highly influential country, and then like wind spread around the world. Trends should be anticipated and plans adjusted &mdash; done neither earlier nor later than necessary.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The Global Media Project requires you to sacrifice Treaties you have already made. But with this high cost, comes big benefits. Each time you advance in Global Media, you capture an Objective card. AND at the end of the game one of your Supreme Power cards generates MUCH more Influence for select Objective cards you have made.&#10;&#10;Each Trend provides useful advantages for the duration of a game round and may be captured for Influence.&#10;&#10;3. REPTILOIDS MODULE&#10;&#10;Consists of: Reptiloid Project * 15 Reptiloid Objective cards * 3 Treaty cards * 3 Contactee cards (Men of Action) * 1 UFO Hysteria card (Trend).&#10;&#10;The World: With the Reptiloids Module, Deep State takes a step into a fictional aspect of conspiracy theories. The ambitions of the &lsquo;Committee&rsquo; on becoming a secret world government have become meaningless since the lizard-like aliens from the planet Nibiru are closer than ever to seizing power on Earth.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Reptiloids Project effectively replaces the Deep State Project. Players compete for Reptiloid Objective cards that allow them to make new Treaties while ignoring their conditions, and they Advance in Reptiloids Project in order to obtain new Treaties and gather Influence at the end &mdash; but only if they have enough Special Interest emblems on their cards!&#10;&#10;4. SUPERIORITY DOCTRINE MODULE&#10;&#10;Consists of: Nuclear Power, Worldwide Bank, and World, Inc. Projects&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each of these Projects replaces one of the base game Projects. Nuclear Power provides you with Ghost Agents for each World War card played. Worldwide Bank extends your ability to reach distant cards further down the Infiltration Zone. World, Inc. returns your Agents back from missions and generates Influence for every Project you participate in.&#10;&#10;PLAYERS&#10;&#10;All Modules are suitable for 1 to 5 players. Detailed solo play rules are provided in the rules for each of the Modules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Salvage Hidden Treasures, the game where you take the helm as Salvage Ship Captains aboard the treacherous high seas. Throughout 16 rounds, you and your rivals will discover and salvage treasure from the depths of the ocean. When the game is up the captain with the biggest haul of treasure will claim victory. Easy, except within the seven seas are pirates, sharks and other hazards lurking in the depths. A clever combination of strategy and good fortune will score you treasures that swing the odds in your favour and ruin the hopes of your rivals.&#10;&#10;Being a salvage ship captain means fighting it out on the high seas, searching for treasure and owning the biggest haul at the end of the game. Starting with one ship, you will take turns discovering, salvaging and bartering for treasure tiles. Navigating your boats across the ocean, you will pay to discover what lies beneath the waves salvaging treasures to claim them as your own. You may want to think of investing some of your money into expanding your fleet from one to three salvage ships. Each boat can only hold so much weight!&#10;&#10;Salvage Hidden Treasures is a turn-based strategy board game taking place over 16 rounds.&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn has four phases:&#10;&#10;     Income&#10;     Market&#10;     Navigation&#10;     Action&#10;&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s not that simple. Among the valuable treasure tiles are twists and turns in the form of events, from pirate attacks to weird weather they will either benefit or scupper your chances of victory. The treasure itself also carries unique abilities that will change the shape of the game entirely depending on what you manage to discover and salvage from the sea.&#10;&#10;Each game lasts for 16 rounds or until all the tiles have been collected. If you are in a 2-player duel or want more time at sea, opt for 20 rounds. The winner is the player with the highest combined treasure value indicated by the treasure chest on each treasure tile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The countdown is on in Diamonds for Water, a new cooperative deck building game from Big Girl Games.&#10;&#10;In each game, a team is made up of water experts who must work together to achieve a final solution to a region-specific water problem. Players begin with a deck of basic cards which are supplemented by purchasing cards from the Market. On each turn, the players must engage with a Conflict, and resolve whatever problems the water issue brings up. Then they gather the resources from the cards in their hand and take any of several actions: help their teammates, purchase new cards for their deck, invest diamonds in the Bank, or trade and spend currency to solve the ongoing Goal or Objective.&#10;&#10;Players choose from characters with special Actions. They may be able to help their fellow players stay healthy, draw extra cards, or receive extra Food or Energy. Each character also has a Skill they can choose to use three times in a game, such as halting the countdown marker or digging through the Market draw deck to find elusive Water cards. While Food and Energy are plentiful, trading for Diamonds requires them to be available in the Bank, and getting them there can require some sacrifice for the team. However, team members can also Plant and Harvest left over Food as a way to raise the currency they need for more expensive items, such as Water cards.&#10;&#10;In the world of the game, Water is actually more valuable than Diamonds. And it becomes more scarce as you play - a Countdown Marker shows how water is running out while your team tries to solve each problem. Let the Countdown Marker reach 0 without resolving each Goal and Objective, and your team loses. Fix the problems using Energy, Diamonds, and Water, and you win!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Using the dream cards, they have two minutes to create a dream story. When the timer runs out, they then have to remember what happened in the dream and in what order. They score points for getting the details correct. At the end of the game, they tally up their score to see how much of their collective dream they've remembered.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",
