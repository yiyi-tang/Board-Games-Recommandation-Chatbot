In the game, which is played out on a scrolling space backdrop, the players take on the roles of brave space pilots sweeping around in nimble yet powerful fighters, searching the asteroid clusters for universal glory and ancient technology. Players compete to obtain the most glory, with glory resulting from carrying out missions, finding lost treasure in asteroid clusters, and destroying alien entities, not to mention other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, players fly through an ever-scrolling space setting, which is represented by rows of cards. Each turn, the bottom row is removed and a new row is added to the top. Players move their spaceships and resolve effects continuously, performing actions such as collecting power-ups and money, fighting alien cruisers and titans, blocking and shooting other players, and dodging asteroids and black holes. The players need to balance the use of their ships' energy as it's used for both absorbing enemy fire and boosting their movement speed and fire rate.&#10;&#10;The game includes missions and achievements as well as a mechanism called &quot;threat level&quot; to keep everyone in suspense throughout the whole game. Threat allows players to enjoy the satisfaction of both shooting wildly at each other and dodging the hundreds of bullets raining down from enemy fighters and other players.&#10;&#10;All player ships are fully upgradeable with four different weapon classes, engines, shields and more. Each player must buy the upgrades and navigate the path that best fits his chosen strategy in order to successfully complete his missions and attain the most glory.&#10;&#10;",

Between 1945 and 1960, the British fought four major &ldquo;emergencies&rdquo;, as they referred to their counterinsurgency campaigns, each trying to manage their retreat from empire. The four games in this pack focus on exploring British counterinsurgent responses to a variety of different opponents, including communist insurgents in Malaya, militant nationalists in Kenya, and smaller and more clandestine terrorist organizations in Palestine and Cyprus. The games adjust the core COIN mechanics to provide a compelling new way of handling two-player conflicts, while also streamlining several mechanics to quicken gameplay. The British Way offers an approachable introduction to the COIN series for new players, while presenting experienced players with four mechanically distinct games to explore and compare.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Will you be one of the heroes that saves Tenefyr?&#10;&#10;Heroes of Tenefyr is a fully cooperative deck-building game for 1 to 4 players. You represent one of the four heroes and start out inexperienced, but with a unique skill card. As you fight your way through dungeons filled with evil creatures, you'll gain loot in the form of cards that are added to your starting deck. Clear a dungeon of monsters and you will be rewarded by the villagers.&#10;&#10;Players will enter dungeons together and fight the enemies within.

Your deck represents your hero's health, so when you run out of cards, your hero becomes exhausted and needs to return to the village to rest. Loot cards that improve your deck are gained from defeating enemies, and the most powerful loot is found in the most dangerous dungeons.&#10;&#10;Whenever the heroes leave a dungeon and return to Tenefyr, time passes. When a certain amount of time has passed, depending on the difficulty setting, the boss attacks. If you manage to defeat the boss, everybody wins, otherwise you all lose.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1870 &ndash; Somewhere deep in Texas, the rearing of Longhorn cattle from northern Mexico is booming. It has now become a major source of income for the Texan farmers, while at the same time attracting cattle thieves of all kinds.&#10;&#10;In Longhorn, the players assume the roles of two particularly feared outlaws: Eagle Perkins and Jessie Artist Byrd. The aim of the game is simple: to steal cattle (and a few gold nuggets, if possible) to see who can amass the most money by the end of the game &mdash; or who can get his opponent arrested by the sheriff!&#10;&#10;The game is set up by shuffling the 9 locations and setting them up in a 3x3 grid, selecting 9 tokens randomly and assigning one to each location (if the sheriff token is in play, it must be placed on Nugget Hill), and finally randomly distributing the coloured longhorn cattle meeples to each location, with the number required being shown on each location. The start player then chooses a location with 4 cattle and places the player piece in it.&#10;&#10;The game ends in one of three ways:&#10;- If a player takes the sheriff token, they lose immediately&#10;- If a player takes all 9 cattle of any one colour, they win immediately (if they did both in the same turn, they lose)&#10;- If no legal move can be made, the players score; gold nugget tokens are worth their face value and each colour of longhorn is worth $100 for each cow of the same colour still on the board. For example, if the Perkins player has 4 black cattle and 5 are left on the board, each of his 4 black longhorns are worth $500. If there are no black cattle (because the Byrd player has them, or through drought) then they are worth nothing. The player with the highet total wins.&#10;&#10;On a players turn, they choose a colour of longhorn present in their location and steal all of that colour. For each longhorn stolen, the player moves the player piece that many spaces and then flips it, to signify that it is now the other player's turn.&#10;&#10;If a location is cleared of longhorn cattle, the player who took the last longhorn must take the token present and activate it. Some are positive and some are negative. Once a space is cleared, it can not be moved to in a future turn, though it can be moved through.&#10;&#10;",

The flow of each Emperor's turn is very simple: spend up to 6 'Imperivm Points' (to Move, Sail, Secure, Subdue or Attack), and then propagate threats with the roll of two dice. The players win if they secure the borders of the Empire before the majority of provinces revolt or Rome falls.&#10;&#10;",

Note that the dragon defends against any odd-numbered tile and the tiger against any even-numbered tile. After defending, place a tile of your own to attack. If a player passes, the next player either passes or defends. If all other players pass on your attack, place a tile from your hand face down, then choose a new tile to attack again. If you attack with the dragon or tiger, a player can defend with any odd- or even-numbered tile, respectively.&#10;&#10;The first player to empty their hand wins the round and scores points based on the last tile that they played and the specific scoring card for that round. They score 1 bonus point for each time an attack of theirs went undefended. At the end of a round, if a player has scored 10+ points, they win.&#10;&#10;Tiger &amp; Dragon is based on the popular Japanese traditional game GOITA, and it can be played with team rules like that earlier team.

After drawing, the active player must take the final card they drew and may select one or both of the previous two cards drawn (if available). They then load these commodity cards on their boat. Cards that are not taken remain available to future players. Once a player's boat is full (seven cards with two players, five cards with 3-6 players), they are out of the round and the day is scored.&#10;&#10;Players score points for the value of their ships' holds, but also for the number of commodities of each type that they have stored in their warehouse. The highest earning merchant over three days wins the game. Some cards do not take up space on ships, while others contribute to the value of a hold, but cannot be stored in warehouses.&#10;&#10;This is the first game to be added to the Medici family of games since Strozzi, released in 2008.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "[Careful: there are two similar games with Entdecker in the title. Don't confuse Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons) with Entdecker, a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board does not have a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]&#10;&#10;A reworking of the game Entdecker, this game still starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed, islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, forts, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful explorer.&#10;&#10;Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence. This updated version adds a larger board, fees to enter from all but one edge of the board, a different income system, new bonus waterfall tiles, the ability to draw (for a price) from open stacks of tiles, and most of all an entirely new area of the board that represents scouts exploring jungles on the islands in search of exotic plants (this is the bonus discovery chip system revamped), and other changes.&#10;&#10;",

The new Heritage card type provides options like Elf, Halfling, and Dwarf. Class cards allow you to invest Experience to &quot;level up&quot; your character. High fantasy themes and challenges can be found throughout the game's 150+ unique cards.&#10;&#10;This game also features overhauled Solo and Co-Op play. Double-sided Adversaries provide an evolving challenge: face a lower-level Adversary at the end of Act II, then the Final Adversary at the end of Act III. In Campaign Mode, players can unlock new cards by defeating each new Adversary. The game incorporates more rewards for cooperative play while still incentivizing individual achievement.&#10;&#10;While points decide the winner of the game, Call To Adventure encourages storytelling at the end of the game. Epic Origins also includes a guide for converting your final tableau into a 5th Edition D&amp;D character.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Descendants of the Kingdom of Kongo, the Bakongo people are the largest group of tribespeople in central Africa.&#10;&#10;A common theme in African folklore is that animals are wise creatures who teach humans to do good and moral things. As a tribal leader, you will follow the guidance of the animals, journeying through the jungle in hopes of winning their favor.&#10;&#10;Players start on a board full of African animals, each with their own movement abilities. Each player can either move as normal or follow the wisdom of the animals, earning that animal's favor in the process and collecting its chip. Some animals will make movement easier, while others can affect how opponents move, giving a lot of depth to this deceivingly simple strategy game. As the game progresses, fewer and fewer animals remain, making choices that much more important.&#10;&#10;Once all the Advancement chips have been collected, each animal will offer a different amount of favor based on how far up they are on the Favor Leaderboard, something that players can affect throughout the game. Bonus points will be given for collecting Nkisi (small statues) and Yowa (spiritual symbols). At the end of the game, the leader who has accumulated the most favor wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Africana, players travel through Africa, taking part in expeditions and trying to be the first to reach various destinations. With the money they earn, they can buy adventure cards that earn them precious antiques. Africana features the &quot;Book of Adventures&quot; game system from Schacht's Valdora in which players can acquire cards that are laid out like books, with players &quot;turning the pages&quot; to find the adventure cards they most want.&#10;&#10;The game board in Africana shows the continent divided in half at the equator, with the cities in the north half colored brown and the cities in the south white. Adventure cards with a brown border can be acquired only in the south and must be delivered to the north, while white-bordered adventure cards take the opposite route. Five expedition cards &ndash; each showing the starting and ending location and a reward for completing the expedition &ndash; are laid face-up on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each player has one researcher token that will travel around the board, and on a turn a player takes one of three possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw two travel cards. (A player can have no more than five travel cards in hand at turn's end.)&#10;    Buy one or more adventure cards, for five coins each. A player can flip one page in the book for free, with each additional flip costing one coin. (A player can have no more than three adventure cards to be fulfilled at turn's end.)&#10;    Move the researcher by paying travel cards that match the color of the space being traveled to. Each player has a joker in hand, which will be retained at the end of each turn. If a player moves onto the start space of an expedition, he can mark that expedition card with a marker; if he reaches the destination for an expedition he's on, he receives the reward depicted and claims the card, while anyone else on the expedition receives nothing. A new expedition card is then revealed.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player reaches the destination shown on an adventure card, that player scores that card by placing it under his player mat. Some cards show helpers, which are represented by helper cards in a player's hand. These cards allow travel on the color shown on the card and return to the player's hand after use, but a player who employs many helps will lose points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Once the expedition cards run out, the game ends and players score for the expeditions they completed, sets of identical and different adventure cards, money in hand, and a few other things. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Around the end of the 19th century, a growing network of railway lines was built in Europe, allowing people to travel to the major cities to visit beautiful structures influenced by Art Nouveau and Historicism.&#10;&#10;In Free Ride, you are one of several people in charge of building railway lines, connecting the cities in Europe, and carrying passengers to those cities. The game board shows 45 cities connected by a network of potential routes, and all railway lines built will be one of three types: lines owned by you, lines owned by fellow players, and state-owned lines. When you travel along railway lines, you pay nothing to travel on your lines and state-owned lines. To travel on a fellow player&rsquo;s line, however, you must pay them 1 coin, which converts their line to state-owned. From then on, traveling on that line is free for all players. As coins are limited, you should carefully balance the building of your lines with the conversion of fellow players' lines to state-owned lines.&#10;&#10;Where do you want to build? At the start of play, each player drafts part of a travel route. Multiple travel routes are available for choosing, and each travel route consists of three cards. When you choose a route, you take either the first and second cards or the second and third cards as your starting and ending point (in that order). Return the unchosen card of that route to the box.&#10;&#10;Once the third deck is empty, you can either withdraw from the game with uncompleted routes (returning those cards to the box) or keep taking turns until you finish all your routes, at which point you immediately gain 1 coin and withdraw. In either situation, you earn 1 coin (and do nothing else) on each subsequent turn. Once all players have withdrawn, you tally your score, earning 3 points for each coin, 5 points for the first card you have of a city, and 2 points for each other card you have of a city. (Each of the 45 cities appears once in each of the three decks.) Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Free Ride also offers a difficult solo challenge!&#10;&#10;",

Then, each player moves based on their speed, and can adjust their speed, choosing to forfeit a Wear Point, or roll the Chance Die, where a bad roll could cause you to move through, spin out, or even crash out of the race.  Whoever gets over the line first wins.&#10;&#10;Before the race begins the players prepare their cars by allocating points, so if you want faster acceleration or speed you have to sacrifice start speed or braking or tire wear.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players write their planned speed for the next turn and then move their cars 1 space per 20 mph. Each curve on the track has a speed limit that cannot be exceeded without penalty. If you exceed curve speed, overaccelerate or overdecelerate your car, etc., you pay penalties in tire wear or possible damage to your car or elimination from the race.&#10;&#10;The original 3M Sports Games version used speedometer wheels to select speed, used a random card draw to determine the car characteristics and has no random elements.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Speed Circuit: British Grand Prix&#10;    Speed Circuit: Detroit Grand Prix&#10;    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de Belgique&#10;    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de France&#10;    Speed Circuit: South African Grand Prix&#10;    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 1&#10;    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 2&#10;    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 3&#10;    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 4&#10;    Speed Circuit: Tournament Tracks&#10;    Speed Circuit: Turnier Kurs&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a war torn land, a magical land of heroic feats and epic quests, there is a place that has never felt the wrath of the ongoing and everlasting war between the five realms. Hidden in the hills of Strongcliff , deep in the shadows of a cavern lies the best kept secret for many years.&#10;&#10;This place is called the Cavern Tavern.&#10;&#10;Cavern Tavern is a worker (dice) placement and resource management game that is set in a fantasy world. Each player assumes the role of a worker in the tavern. Your job is to serve drinks, work in the kitchen, do chores, and on top of that try to keep every guest happy, including the nasty and greedy barkeep.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can assign his dice to 1 of the 21 locations in the tavern.&#10;&#10;These locations are divided in 6 sections. The Main area, where the guests are located and from where each player must pick up an Order, Cellar where all the ingredients that are used to complete the Orders are located, Kitchen where players can work to receive different rewards, as well as the Chores section. Also, the board features the Wizards workshop where the players can seek help for completing the Orders and Nasty the Dwarf's office where the players can go and try to suck up to the boss and badmouth a coworker.&#10;&#10;The players will have to complete the Orders as soon as possible, because for each round they are late, they&rsquo;ll receive less points than the Order's original value.&#10;&#10;Also, for being late with the Orders, your reputation with Nasty the Dwarf is affected, something that is vital in the game.&#10;&#10;To stand out from other workers and gain your employers favor, you&rsquo;ll need to skillfully manage the orders from your customers and the resource ingredients. You&rsquo;ll have to carefully prioritize your moves, and choose from what kind of work you&rsquo;ll profit the most out of the situation.&#10;&#10;So&hellip; do you have what it takes? Get ready for the biggest challenge in your life, and start working in Cavern Tavern.&#10;&#10;",

Each equation card has five equations on it, for a total of ten equations that will be in effect for the duration of the game. The equations state equivalences between certain combinations of colors, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Red = Green Green&#10;    Green Yellow = Blue Blue Red&#10;&#10;&#10;Four target cards are turned up, each with some combination of five chips represented on the target card (so a typical target card might be Green Green Blue Blue Blue).&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll a colored die to randomly pick a colored chip for yourself, or you can make one exchange of your colored chips based on the equations. The goal is to end up with the right combination of chips to get one of the target cards. You want to do this quickly &ndash; and even more importantly, with as few chips left over as possible after you've purchased the target card &ndash; because this is how you score points.&#10;&#10;The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;",

The battle for the tiny Island raged for four days and, when it was finally over, fewer than 200 of the 5,000 Japanese defenders remained alive. One map, two counter-sheets and 55 cards.&#10;&#10;",

Each player represents a different House whose rulers are viewed by terrestrial population as gods. Players build bases, recruit troops, embody gods, explore the territory, develop their own technology, sign trade contracts, defeat local dominions and other players' armies, trying to conquer Atlantis, which owns huge treasures.&#10;&#10;Different actions will provide a certain number of immediate Victory Points. Moreover, random setup goals will provide you with sizable Victory Point rewards at the end of the game, based on specific conditions. In the end, the player with the most VPs will be the winner.&#10;&#10;In addition to having a strong dose of controllability (the luck factor is minimal), the game features an innovative starred action-selection-system that confronts players with interesting choices: players can reincarnate their gods by performing their actions in a precise sequence, on pre-established paths of their starred player board, or they can give up some deities, jumping freely from one action to another of their board, to choose from time to time the situationally best actions.&#10;&#10;Cover Art by Paolo Vicenzi &amp; Jara Zambrano&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After a long dark winter, the sun is shining and it's party time for the penguins, who celebrate by fishing. To look over the waters more easily, the penguins build high pyramids. The more penguins you can fit in the pyramid, the better &mdash; but it's not that easy.&#10;&#10;In Penguin Party, players collectively build a pyramid of penguins, trying to empty their hands of cards along the way. The deck consists of 36 penguin cards: 8 green and 7 each of red, blue, yellow, and purple. Deal the deck out as evenly as possible, with the final card in a five-player game starting as the first card in the base of the pyramid.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either play a card to the left or right of the base of the pyramid, which can be at most eight cards wide, or play a card on a higher level of the pyramid so long as it's supported by two penguins, at least one of which is the same color as the card being played. If you cannot play a card, discard your hand face down and take as many penalty markers as the number of cards you didn't play. If you empty your hand, you can return two penalty markers previously collected to the supply.&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players, with each player starting one of the rounds. Whoever has the fewest penalty markers at the end of the game wins. (With two players, deal each player 14 cards, remove the other cards from play without looking at them, and build a pyramid with a base only seven cards wide.)&#10;&#10;Admin note: This game looks very similar to Penguin, but differs not only in components (being a card game while Penguin has 3D penguin tokens), but also in the number of colors and distribution. Penguin has four colors with nine pieces each, while this game has five colors with a distribution of 4x7 + 1x8.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It&rsquo;s 1833. The East India Company has just had its monopoly of trade revoked by an official act of Parliament. You, and others like you, see a golden opportunity for profit in China. For too long the Company&rsquo;s polite deference to the Qing has smothered progress and stifled trade. There is real money to be made here and you intend to make it.&#10;&#10;An Infamous Traffic is a brutal economic board game for two to five souls brave enough to conduct the opium trade in the fracturing political landscape of 19th century Qing China. Initially, you will need to rely on smugglers in order to get your products into the interior, but, if Parliament can be swayed, perhaps an open war can make the trade more secure. At the same time, you&rsquo;ll want to be careful. If British aggression goes unchecked, the region may become a failed state, which could jeopardize your hard fought gains.&#10;&#10;Of course, the massive wealth you&rsquo;ll earn won&rsquo;t be enough. Trade is still a dirty word among those in the top rungs of society. You certainly haven't forgotten how your business holdings were sneered at by some prodigal baronet during your brief stint at Oxford. They don&rsquo;t understand. The empire they enjoy was built on trade, not pedigree. So, you&rsquo;ll play their game, snatching up the precious symbols of nobility with your hard won cash. Perhaps you can restore a beloved castle and stuff it full of the latest luxuries. The right marriage or government post would certainly guarantee your place in society. You might even be tempted to rob your own firm to get that extra edge back home.&#10;&#10;In any case, there&rsquo;s demand for opium in China, and you intend to meet it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;See the Living Rules.

The game is played in twelve turns, each one representing 2 days time, on a map scale of 10.5 km/hex.&#10;&#10;This wargame is famous for its innovative use of &quot;untried&quot; Soviet units.  These untried Soviet counters enter play face down, their combat strength unknown to either player, until they take part in combat, at which time they are flipped to reveal their strength and defense numbers.&#10;&#10;The game also models the effectiveness of German operations by allowing them a full mechanized movement phase both before and after combat, while the Soviets only move prior to combat.  In addition, if all of a German division's regiments attack or defend in the same hex, their strength is doubled by a divisional integrity bonus.&#10;&#10;The German player scores victory points for the capture of cities, and for any Soviet units redirected from the Southwestern Front.  The Soviet player scores vp for recaptured cities and destroying entire German divisions (which possess several steps of strength).&#10;&#10;The game includes: 1 map, counters (AH edition = 260; SPI edition = 200), 1 6-sided die, 1 Soviet reference card, 1 German reference card, 1 rules book, and 1 advanced rules insert.&#10;&#10;",

Players play cards from their hands of different values. But the colour of the card is not determined until the card is played, and the cat is let out of the box.&#10;&#10;Played over three rounds for three players, and four rounds for four, players begin by making a bid on the number of tricks they will win, based only upon the value of their hand cards. The cats on the cards have no colour at this point. Players will score for tricks they win, and score more for completing their bid.&#10;&#10;As a player leads with a card from their hand, they declare its colour. A player's marker goes onto the communal research board, covering the value for that colour. Subsequent cards must have different values of the same colour if possible. However, a player may declare that they do not have any more cards of that colour, and so play the same value but in a different colour. That player now marks their own board for Do Not Have in that colour.&#10;&#10;The highest card of the colour lead wins the trick, unless a card is declared as red, the trump colour.&#10;&#10;Crucially, all cards values and colours played out must be unique, otherwise a paradox is formed, ending the round.&#10;&#10;So if a player is holding a 1,3,6, and yellow is lead, and only the yellow 1 remains open on the research board, the player is forced to play their 1 card as a yellow. But if that player has already claimed they Do Not Have yellow (as above), and if the other colours are also blocked on 1, 3 and 6, this causes a paradox. They cannot play, thus ending the round and triggering a scoring.&#10;&#10;The player causing the paradox does not score and incurs penalty points also.&#10;&#10;Scores are accumulated over the rounds, and the player with the highest total at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must balance trying to win tricks to their bid with avoiding forming a paradox, forcing the round to end and incurring penalties.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A States of Siege (TM) game.&#10;&#10;This solitaire game, suitable for group and classroom cooperative game play, tells the story of the English Civil Wars (1640-53) through its key events and decision points. You attempt to stop the advance of four armies bent on destroying Parliament and Puritanism, whom you represent; simply holding on to London is not enough.&#10;&#10;Each of the three English Civil Wars are replayed through the use of separate card decks that recreate the historical military and political events that could spell doom to the Parliamentarian forces. There are civil wars going on not just in England, but in Scotland and Ireland too; and each will have varying impact on the play of the game at different times.&#10;&#10;The title comes from the purported response to the beheading of King Charles by his implacable foe, Oliver Cromwell, who remarked that this act of regicide was a &ldquo;cruel necessity.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Note: Cruel Necessity is our first Gold Banner wargame to exclude a mounted map inside. Because of all the gameplay real estate in Cruel Necessity, mounting the boards using our print-on-demand publishing model would have raised the Retail Price to $55.00 (i.e., a $15 increase), and that just seemed like too much. We hope our vaunted wargame customers can soldier on with our sturdy paper maps as the great wargames of yore have long provided.&#10;&#10;What's in the box:&#10;&#10;&bull; One full color 22-page Rulebook (Designer's Notes included)&#10;&bull; One 22&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; paper game map (in two sections)&#10;&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; Battle Display Mat&#10;&bull; 75 cards&#10;&bull; 98 thick, two-sided, multi-shaped game pieces&#10;&bull; One 2-sided player aid&#10;&bull; One blue (Parliamentary) 6-sided die&#10;&bull; One red (Royalist) 6-sided die&#10;&bull; One bright red, 9&quot; x 11 7/8&quot; Deluxe cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull; One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull; One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull; One charcoal desiccant packet&#10;&#10;",

But five days ago, a mysterious evil power opened the gate and changed the code. Asteros is haunted by fear and disasters again! The wise leader ORAKL asked the Council of United Planets and they sent four famous agents: EKHO, HAL, ELLI and NOVA. ORAKL the wise and the four brave agents begin to fight against the evil powers to save Asteros. They must find the Code to reset the Gate and confine the monsters again.

Players must find the answer Code with the four Runes in the right arrangement before the evil power devours the planet. Players can explore the planet to collect energy or clues and to fight against evil monsters. When players try to unlock the code, the App or the game master will give signs that lead to right code.&#10;&#10;If players successfully find the code, they win; if the Darkness Level reaches the Red Moon because of the evil monsters or if the Character card deck is exhausted, the players lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ships deals with the history of shipping, from the time of the Phoenicians to the modern era. The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.&#10;&#10;Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.&#10;&#10;When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.&#10;&#10;Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.&#10;&#10;NOTE: this description is out-of-date.&#10;&#10;",

Devices start simple with just two components (one source and one component), but devices with three, four or more components will become possible &mdash; as soon as the players assemble a device to let it be possible. Because of the modular mix-and-match nature of the components, the available action spaces vary widely from one game to the next, providing great replayability: each game players will create devices never seen before!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The future of humanity awaits you in Space Gate Odyssey. A system of viable exoplanets has been recently discovered and the Confederations are flocking into space to colonize it. In this 2 to 4-player development and flow-management board game, you play the leader of one of these Confederations and play your influence in the Odyssey command station to send as many of your settlers as you can on these exoplanets.&#10;&#10;After decades of research and technological development, humanity is preparing to leave the Earth to colonize this discovered system. To get there, only one possible means of transport exists: space gates. For reasons related to physics and other quantum aspects, these gates can be built only in space. The Confederations have therefore embarked on the construction of their own station in orbit, equipped with space gates.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the colonizing era, these portals make it possible to go on one of the first three discovered planets. As soon as an entire contingent of settlers has joined the gate of a space station, it is teleported to the corresponding exoplanet. The landing conditions vary according to the planets and the choice of colonized spots quickly becomes strategic.&#10;&#10;As soon as one of the three exoplanets is fully colonized, each Confederation gains influence according to its placement, then access to one of the two later discovered exoplanets becomes possible. At the end of the colonization of the five exoplanets, the stations are teleported to the Hawking planet and the influence of each Confederation is assessed. The leader of the most influential Confederation will be promoted to the rank of Governor of this new system.&#10;&#10;One of the biggest challenges in Space Gate Odyssey is your ability to quickly develop and intelligently arrange your space station. The better you optimize the flow of your settlers to your station, then to the exoplanets, the more of them you can send to the favorable spots and thus gain influence.&#10;&#10;The choice of the modules, their arrangement, and the distance between the airlocks and the gates are therefore essential elements &mdash; especially since, at the end of the game, the domains of the modules you used to build your station will bring you additional influence points if they are in line with the position of the domains on the Hawking planet Predominance.&#10;&#10;Finally, you must be careful not to leave too many open corridors on the space void as this represents a real danger for your settlers and could therefore damage your reputation.&#10;&#10;Your most amazing quest starts with Space Gate Odyssey. Will you be able to take over your opponents in order to take control of the new system, or will you stay at the dock?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle for Castle Itter was fought near the Austrian village of Itter on 5 May 1945, in the last days of the War in Europe during World War II. US soldiers joined forces with Wehrmacht infantrymen, an SS officer, an Austrian resistance fighter, and recently freed French prisoners of war to defend an Austrian castle against an attacking force from the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division.&#10;&#10; &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Object of the GameDuring a game of Castle Itter, you take the role of the force that defended the castle from 0400 - 1600 on 5 May 1945. The goal of the game is to last until the SS deck is depleted, without allowing SS Counters to reach the castle. You score points for each Defender that survives the assault and lose points for each SS Counter remaining on the board at the end of the game - the higher your score, the better. &#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game OverviewCastle Itter is divided into turns. Each turn consists of two phases:&#10;&#10;&bull; Defender Phase: Take five actions with Defender counters&#10;&bull; SS Phase: Play three SS cards&#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Defender PhaseDuring each turn you take five actions with your Defenders. You can only take one action with a Defender on a turn. When you take an action with a Defender, place an Action Token on the Defender.  If you use an action that exhausts a Defender, flip the Defender to its exhausted side. The actions include:&#10;&#10;&bull; Attack&#10;&bull; Suppress&#10;&bull; Move within a location&#10;&bull; Move to a new location&#10;&bull; Special Actions (Command and Escape)&#10;&bull; Recover&#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;SS PhaseOnce you have completed your five Defender actions for the turn, reveal three SS Cards from the SS deck, one at a time, resolving the effect of each one before moving to the next. After all three SS Cards have been resolved, discard them. The turn is over and the next turn begins with five new Defender actions.&#10;&#10;There are four different categories of SS Cards, based on the card effect:&#10;&#10;&bull; Attack Defenders&#10;&bull; Attack Location&#10;&bull; Disrupt Defenders&#10;&bull; Place SS Counters&#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Ending the GameThe game ends at the end of the turn when the SS deck is exhausted or immediately if the 142nd Infantry Regiment card is drawn from the SS deck.&#10;&#10;",

The next player either passes (but can play on a future turn) or plays the same number of cards (or one more than that number) with a higher value. When you play two or more cards, the cards must be the same number or color, and the value of these cards is created by placing their digits in order from high to low. For example, if you play a blue 3 and blue 6, their value is 63, not 36. When you play and are not the lead, you must take one of the cards from the previous play into your hand, then discard the rest.&#10;&#10;Play continues around the table until either a player is out of cards, which ends the round immediately, or all players have passed in succession. In the latter case, discard the cards last played; whoever played these cards lays a single card to start a new round. Alternatively, if the lead player has cards in hand of a single suit or number, they play all of these cards at once to end the hand. When a hand ends, each player scores 1 point for each card they still hold.&#10;&#10;If no player has at least 15 points, shuffle the deck and start a new hand.

    "Description": "(not to be confused with Knizia's Beowulf: The Movie Board Game)&#10;&#10;The fascinating legend of the great hero Beowulf is told in one of the oldest works of English literature.  This game relives the legend of how the Geatish warrior Beowulf comes to the aid of the Danish King against the fearsome monster Grendel, how he returns to his home in Geatland to become King, and how Beowulf meets his end when fighting the terrible dragon.&#10;&#10;Beowulf: The Legend, designed by renowned game designer Reiner Knizia, invites you to accompany the mighty hero as one of his brave comrades.  Will you become the most renowned warrior and succeed Beowulf as king?  Only the strongest will prevail!&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of auctions depicting different events in the legend of Beowulf. Players &quot;bid&quot; in the auctions by offering up cards representing the skills they will offer to help Beowulf succeed (fighting, cunning, etc.) in an attempt to earn rewards of points or powerful cards, or to avoid injuries or other penalties. Players can also take a `Risk' and draw two cards from the deck to bid with. But if the cards don't match the current auction, the player is forced to drop out. Players need to carefully manage their hands and the timing of when they choose to take risks to increase their chances of winning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As long as your action markers remain on the board, you may be able to gain secondary bonus actions whenever you or another player repeat the action.&#10;&#10;While Dark Ages features objectives commonly found in 4X games &mdash; encouraging you to explore nearby regions, expand your territory, exploit the resources, and exterminate your opponents &mdash; it does so featuring several Euro-centric mechanisms. Collect resources from lands under your control, using them to build up your cities and fortifications. Some building types provide several ways for you to gain important in-game advantages, while others enhance your military strength or simply score you victory points. As you expand your territory, you will lay claim to noble titles, acquire new technologies, and train your military units. Each region and leader offer asymmetrical choices with their unique abilities.&#10;&#10;Dark Ages is actually two games: Western Europe (subtitled Heritage of Charlemagne) and Central Europe (subtitled Holy Roman Empire). While both versions feature identical gameplay, each focuses its attention on a specific part of Europe during the Dark Ages (Western and Central, respectively). As a result, the game board maps differ between the two versions, as do the lands in which players vie for control over along with the flavor of the inhabitants and leaders of those lands. However, by combining both versions, you can enlarge the map into an epic battle for superiority for five or more players!&#10;&#10;Each game box is filled with finely sculpted miniatures of cities, fortresses, farms, and other buildings. The different types of troops &mdash; infantry, bowmen, and cavalry &mdash; are represented by unique miniatures.&#10;&#10;The solo mode for Dark Ages has been designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "How did Rome get to be Rome? Why did the Glory That Was Greece fade? What stopped Carthage from making an empire of the Mediterranean? Could the Seleucids really have conquered the western world?&#10;&#10;PAX ROMANA covers Europe from 300 BC through the end of the 1st century BC, when control of the Mediterranean was in a state of flux with four empires possible. The emphasis is on strategic operations, from raising armies to colonizing outlying areas, to fighting barbarian incursions, to maintaining political stability at home. &#10;PAX uses a unique marker-oriented play sequence that provides surprise and opportunity, plus a deck of unusual cards that provide the historical background of events and calamities within which the players must operate.&#10;&#10;PAX provides wide variety of scenarios, from fast-playing, one-sitting two-player games to vivid recreations of the entire era with four players. The game works well with 2, 3 or 4 players, and is designed to be playable solitaire for those interested in the historical view it provides. Scenarios range from The Punic Wars, through the Eastern Med conflicts between the Greeks and the Seleucids, all the way up to the entire 10 turn game, covering 300 years of history. In addition, there are two versions of PAX: the Standard Game, designed for fast play, and the Advanced version, which adds in much tangential history and allows for a more introspective examination of the era.&#10;&#10;PAX ROMANA includes one gamemap, 55 cards, 400+ counters, and a host of play aids and charts to keep things organized.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Legacy: Gears of Time is a strategic card game, mechanically rooted in its time travel theme. Players each play cards from their own hand, draw from a central draw pile, move and play technologies on a single timeline, while placing their influence cubes on existing technologies.&#10;&#10;Legacy is played on a timeline that grows at the end of each of 4 rounds. Players take turns during a round consisting of 3 actions each. During each turn, you may travel back in time, play a technology card from your hand, influence an existing technology, or draw two cards (keeping only one).&#10;&#10;As you travel back in time, Technologies are played from your hand by paying their discard cost. Any technologies you play generate influence for you automatically.&#10;&#10;Having more influence than your opponents is the key to claiming rewards for a technology! At the end of each round, rewards are given for each technology and its dependencies. One Influence cube from each technology will come off at the end of each round, forming your influence pool to be used in future rounds to influence existing technologies. Keep in mind, a technology is only considered successful if all of its dependencies exist previously on the timeline.&#10;&#10;Since there are several copies of each technology, you may be able to preempt and eliminate an existing copy by playing yours earlier in the timeline!  Be sure there is room for your new technology, though; each time-frame has a capacity equal to it's distance from the present.&#10;&#10;There are also a few rare but powerful Fate cards, each allowing you to break the rules in interesting ways. Fate cards have no discard cost and don't require an action to be played.&#10;&#10;By strategically influencing existing technologies, adapting to your opponents actions, and carefully choosing when to go further back in time, you will find yourself victorious over your rivals! History remains intact until the Ancient Machine demands you return to the past to rebuild history, and your Legacy, once more.&#10;&#10;Summary:&#10;&#10;     4 Rounds&#10;     4 Turns per Round&#10;     3 Actions per Turn (any mix of the following):&#10;         Travel back in Time&#10;         Play a Technology card&#10;         Influence an existing Technology&#10;         Draw two cards (keep one)&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dinosaurs reside on the modular hexagons of the super-continent Pangaea. Each hex can only support a certain number of animals. Not only that, the continent is splitting up with parts of the land disappearing and new lands emerging elsewhere.  Players try to disperse as widely as is wise while still dominating each continent where they exist. The game ends as the meteorite strikes, ending the age of the great dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;Players begin by placing herds of their dinosaurs on the single continent of Pangea, made from tiles of various terrain types. They then take turns, which comprise of drifting tiles, conducting optional actions, and finally resolving any of their own tribes that have been left in water or on overpopulated tiles. The first phase, the drift, involves a player moving a landscape tile of the same type as depicted on the card they play. The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds. Players have 4 action points to spend on other optional actions, including another drift, migrating herds, rescuing swimming herds and reproducing to create more herds.&#10;&#10;Points are scored during the game whenever a new separate continent is formed as a result of a landscape tile drift, as well as at the end of the game for each continent. During the game, the player with the most herds on the new continent scores 2 points, while the player with the second-most scores 1. End-game scoring is much more significant, as the player with the most herds gains 1 point per landscape tile on the continent, and the player with the second most scores half that amount.&#10;&#10;The final round begins when the meteor strike card is drawn, and the game then ends. After final scoring is completed, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Premiere: Essen 2002&#10;&#10;",

Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful as this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.&#10;&#10;Death Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau-building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their journey and scrapbook in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose whether to assign a card to their journey, or move cards from their journey to their scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (which affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley. Each card also lists a hazard: heat, terrain, flood or animals. Having three of the same hazard visible in their tableau causes the player to bust and lose all the progress in their journey.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players sum the stars in their journey and any additional points from card abilities to determine who wins.&#10;&#10;Death Valley was a top-three finalist in Button Shy's 18-Card Challenge: Design a game about a real life location.&#10;&#10;",
