The Inner Sphere 'Mechs hastily upgraded with field modifications to counter the Clans are proving their worth, as notable pilots rise to become heroes and new, more time tested variants - sporting weapons right out of R&amp;D labs - make their presence felt, while the Clan OmniMechs continue to prove they are still the cutting edge of military technology.&#10;&#10;Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrades fully updates this venerable product, fleshing out the history of each design, including notable MechWarriors/pilots, as well as providing fresh illustrations. Additionally, all the 'Mechs, vehicles and aerospace fighters originally found in the now out-of-print Technical Readout: 2750 are included.&#10;&#10;",

Use this tile to make your next opponent &quot;sleep&quot;, causing them to have their turn skipped. Play continues with the next player.&#10;Mayor: The Mayor of Halloweentown often flips his head around to express joy or anxiety and this tile can help you &quot;flip&quot; your opponent's rack around. When using this tile, choose any opponent to spin his/her rack around. He/she can spin the rack as fast as he/she likes but should be careful as tiles often fly off in many directions.&#10;&#10;",

The second battle pack, The Path of the Zealot, brought new forces for the Skaven and the witch hunters. Now, new heroes are rising to do battle with the growing rat menace.&#10;&#10;The might of Gurni Thorgrimson and Ugrok Beardburna explode on the scene. Gurni gets more deadly with each attachment he is given. Ugrok takes the berserk ability to a new level, gaining a point of power for each damage on him. Empire Reiksguard Swordsmen are a powerful ally with their Counterstrike capabilities, and Dark Elf Cold One Chariots get bigger with each development put into play. Chaos and High Elves each gain new units to lay waste to their foes.&#10;&#10;The Skaven will not give up the gains they have acquired and are bringing to bear the power and ferocity of the Rat Ogres and Gutter Runners. Rat Ogres can allow you to get more out of your Skaven units, and the terrifying Clan Moulder Elite Rat Ogres are solid walls of muscle that can overwhelm many a foe.&#10;&#10;Empires rise and fall, and they require development and support if they are to last. The Scout Camp can provide you new options, and the Anvil of Doom assists the forces of Order by improving the quality of their weapons and armour. Each side will be forced to employ new tactics in an ever-shifting tide of battle and kingdom-building. Mob Up lets the Orcs see the fruits of their fighting, without that annoying Order ability to cancel damage getting in the way. Grasping Darkness gives the Dark Elves control of a unit with low power, if but for an instant. Lastly, Reap What&rsquo;s Sown gives vast power to those who build up their lands.&#10;&#10;War has arrived. Blood has been shed. Many lives on both sides have been lost. New power is coming.

    "Description": "This is a game for the piecepack game system. The rules and examples of play are in the files section.&#10;&#10;In the Age of Sail there was the development of the Battle Line to have a combat effectiveness as high as possible. In particular the British Royal Navy laid this doctrine down in the Fighting Instructions and adhered to them in a stubborn manner. This led in the second half of the 18th century to many undecided battles which could have been won with a little initiative. The Navy had to wait for an Admiral Nelson to change this.&#10;In Piecepack Seabattle each player tries to destroy the opposing battle line with his own battle line. During manoeuvring you can achieve an advantageous position. During the fighting you need luck as it was in all sea battles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Consensus Junior is the third and newest addition to the award-winning Consensus collection. As the name implies, this one's for the kids.&#10;&#10;The game follows the same, award-winning design as the other two versions. There's a large, colorful board, a deck of 200 noun cards, a deck of 75 adjective cards, a deck of voting cards (8 sets of cards, each with a unique border color, numbering 1-10) and a collection of 8 colored pawns, one for each of the sets of voting cards. The board has numbered spaces for 10 noun cards, a space for the adjective card, and a scoring track. The noun cards are drawn and placed face-up, one in each of the numbered spaces on the board. An adjective card is turned over. Players select the one noun they think most closely fits the adjective, place their vote face down on the table, and then take turns revealing their selection. The answer receiving the greatest number of votes is deemed the winning answer and the players who chose the winning answer move ahead one space. In a case where there is no clear majority, no one scores. Hence the name, Consensus.&#10;&#10;The key to the difference between the Junior Edition and the other editions of Consensus is the content of the noun and adjective cards. Given, for example, the following randomly selected noun cards:&#10;&#10;* Bee Hive&#10;    * Bed Bug&#10;    * My Daddy&#10;    * Nemo&#10;    * World Peace&#10;&#10;Which would you vote for if the adjective were (also a random sample):&#10;&#10;* Rare&#10;    * Adorable&#10;    * Unforgettable&#10;&#10;If the adjective were &quot;rare,&quot; which do you think is, um, rarest: your daddy, world peace, Nemo? Which the most adorable? Which the most self-evidently unforgettable?&#10;&#10;Even as the mature person you most obviously are, you'd still have a somewhat clear and more or less patently obvious choice, regardless of which adjective was chosen. And, with an &quot;opponent&quot; of the unabashed certainty of an eight-year-old, you know there will be strong opinions about everything. This is what makes the Junior Edition so appealing: everyone counts, everyone in the family finds themselves personally invited, everyone has an opinion, everyone feels equally entitled, equally correct, and, with the Junior edition, pretty much equally informed. How many family games can you say that about?&#10;&#10;",

Millions have died, mighty armies have fallen, and ancient empires have shattered, with no end in sight. But even as all hope seems lost, heroes old and new rise from the ashes of fire-blackened worlds to stand against the chaos and, maybe, to start turning the tide at last.&#10;&#10;Jihad Hot Spots: 3072 continues the series begun with Dawn of the Jihad, bringing the readers into the ongoing chaos and horror of the Sphere-spanning war, as seen from the eyes of those who fight - and die - in this epic conflict. Players of both Classic BattleTech and the Classic BattleTech RPG will find additional rules and campaign tracks within to continue their campaigns across the Inner Sphere as the Blakist holy war rages on. Finally, Jihad Hot Spots: 3072 contains a mini-Technical Readout section - including record sheets - for several new units, including the six new celestial-series Word of Blake OmniMechs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On October 25, 3068, the Word of Blake flooded the Inner Sphere HPG networks with &quot;White Noise&quot;, a stream of gibberish and propaganda that made communications virtually impossible. Amid the noise, stunning secrets were revealed: Anastasius Focht was once Frederick Steiner; ComStar Primus Sharilar Mori was a Kurita spy.&#10;&#10;Yet along with the secrets revealed and the spreading fires of the Jihad, the Blakists unveiled terrible new weapons and an army the size of which the intelligence agencies of the Inner Sphere had scarcely dreamed, spawning a darker, new wave of mysteries, and whispers of shadowy cabals. Hidden worlds, cults of assassins, ancient societies and even the mysteries of hyperspace - all emerged as possible sources for the Word of Blake's newfound power. Once more spanning all of human space from ancient Terra to the far-flung Clan homeworlds, the conspiracies behind the Jihad could be the key to unraveling the greatest war since the days of Amaris.&#10;&#10;Jihad Conspiracies: Interstellar Players 2 describes several of the most powerful and influential people, organizations, and entities at work behind the scenes of the Word of Blake Jihad. Some of these conspiracies are firmly grounded in Classic BattleTech lore, but shown here in ways never before seen; others have only recently emerged from their own shadows. Gamemasters and players can decide which of these power brokers are real and which are paranoid fantasies spawned by the chaos and fear of the Blakist Holy War!&#10;&#10;",

Almost as soon as the Word of Blake formed in 3052, &quot;Uncle Chandy&quot; put his vast network of spies and his massive wealth toward digging behind their fa&ccedil;ade and now, two decades later, Uncle Chandy has discovered more than he ever thought possible. Now he&rsquo;s using that knowledge to send a coalition of forces against one of the Blakists&rsquo; hidden five worlds: the Ruins of Gabriel. More importantly, he&rsquo;s found a connection to the single greatest mystery in the last half-millennia.

One player plays the 4 tigers, the other one the 25 hunters. Tigers are on the board from the beginning and moving one space orthogonally, while hunters are first placed on the board one by one until all hunters are on the board. Then these also move in the same way.&#10;Tigers now can capture hunters by jumping over one hunter and land on a free space behind it or move (not jump!) between two hunters and remove both of them. If a jump opens an occasion for another jump, this is done in the same move, and so on. The tigers are forced to capture as many hunters as possible, and the tigers` player has to tell before his move, how many total hunters he will capture in his move.&#10;The only way hunters can capture tigers is a wrong move by the tigers` player. This is, when the tigers move in a way that they are only capturing less hunters than possible, if made a &quot;perfect&quot; move. The tiger which is doing the &quot;wrong&quot; move, is captured.&#10;Hunters win, if tigers are all captured or immobilized. There are two more special situations, both &quot;stalemates&quot;, but wins for the hunters: 1. If hunters are immobile (Mandua stalemate) or 2. if they are even sacrificed with the effect of immobilizing the remaining hunters. &#10;Tigers win, if all hunters are captured.&#10;This game was invented by two Germans living in Indonesia and is derived from the tactics of ancient Indian tiger-hunting.&#10;&#10;",

The rest of the players get different game boards depicting 9 objects or people and corresponding US measurements such as &quot;7oz bottle of soda&quot;.  The caller reads off a metric measurement, and then players say if they believe they have the matching US measurement depicted on their card, they get to cover that picture with a miniature metric ruler.  The first player to cover all of the pictures on their cards wins the game.  If answers are disputed, players can refer to the reference book.&#10;&#10;",

If the color matches one of the dice, he or she gets a chip and the game passes on to the next player who has to find a stick in one of the remaining two colors, etc. If a stick doesn't match any of the dice, a chip has to be paid to the bank, the stick is put into the tray (on the other of the two sides of it). A player who can pull out the stick matching the last die gets all chips from the bank. The sticks are then put back into the tray, on the side which currently has less sticks.

Players move one pawn around on a one way board using numbered tokens from one to three. Only after all players have used all of their tokens they become available to be used again. This constitutes one round, while the game is played for six or eight rounds for three or four players. Each turn the active player has to carry out the action where the pawn lands. These actions inluce buying &amp; selling stocks in four companies, drawing an event card, or one of four more special actions.&#10;&#10;Compared to Fund Manager in Super Stocks players have both more power to influence the stock prices and more tools to reduce randomness.
