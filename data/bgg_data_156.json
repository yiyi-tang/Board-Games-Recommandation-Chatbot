If you turn over a square tile along with a matching round tile in an opponent's possession, you get to keep that face-up round tile and give the opponent one of your face-down round tiles in exchange. Sweet!&#10;&#10;In addition, if you reveal the empty package, leave that tile face up and add another round tile to the ones you already have; now you must reveal five tiles instead of four. If you turn over a money tile at the start of your turn, then turn over the other two money tiles, you remove them from play and place them on one of your round tiles, which now counts as being face-up.&#10;&#10;The first player to turn all of his round tiles face up wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Parikrama is a relaxing, yet witty travel card game. In this game, you are a solo traveler wandering through a myriad of landscapes in the pursuit of discovery, adventure and enlightenment - traversing across forests, rivers, deserts and valleys that come along your path... occasionally discovering monuments along your way to rejuvenate and pray.&#10;&#10;There are a lot of choices to be made - taking a shorter journey can help you move faster in the game, but a longer journey can be more rewarding, additionally landing you a chance to hitch-hike on your next journey via a bullock carriage, a riverboat ferry.. or even jump on the truck to travel even faster!&#10;&#10;Completing a journey awards you with not just points but experience as well, which will help you travel more efficiently as the game progresses. Every journey also gifts you with an inscribed tile, a lost clay tablet with mysterious symbols and patterns that unveil fantastic Parikrama routes of the ancient times! When connected carefully, these tiles yield powerful results - and the player who first joins a pattern of 9 tiles, has completed their Parikrama map and triggers the end game!&#10;&#10;The player with the best balance of a vivid journal, the right collection of symbols and Parikrama routes gathers the most points and wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Designed by veteran designer Brian Train, Summer Lightning is an operational simulation of the invasion of Poland by German, Slovakian and Soviet forces in September-October 1939. The campaign was a brief, bloody, and confusing affair fought between two armies which were considered equals by many in the world.&#10;&#10;Despite the interesting campaign, there aren&rsquo;t many war games on the Polish campaign, probably because the conventional wisdom is that it was a very unbalanced contest. This is informed mostly by hindsight. The German Army knew it had superior numbers and organization, but much of its equipment was no better than that fielded by the Poles, the concept of blitzkrieg had not been proven in actual combat, and they were not at all sure that the campaign would not bog down into static fighting. As it was the Germans lost over 16,000 dead in five weeks of campaigning.&#10;&#10;Summer Lightning uses a proven game system that features an interactive sequence of play and near-diceless combat that both shows the historical German superiority in command and control and is flexible enough to allow players to explore many variations and options, so that the game can be as equal (or unequal) a contest as they want. Options include: variable Polish deployments; greater or lesser surprise and speed of mobilization; changed attitudes of the Soviet Union or neighbouring countries; French intervention; Plan Zachod (the Romanian Bridgehead Strategy); and even the possibility that the Blitzkrieg, so appealing in theory, fizzles out on the battlefield. Also, because so many war games are designed for two but played by one, an optional solitaire play method is included.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your mission? Lead a daring rescue attempt to save innocent citizens from the corrupted Paris Nouveau government. You've been in this together from the beginning. You've had each other's backs, but we fear some of your team may have been bought off by the hunters &mdash; especially since our last team didn't come back. Trust no one but yourself!&#10;&#10;In Exodus: Paris Nouveau, you're a member of a specialist team sent on a rescue mission to save refugees trapped in an urban warzone. At the start of the game, the players are secretly and randomly divided into two teams: those with a secret hunter ID card are on the hunters team, and those with a secret rescuer ID card are on the rescuers team. The problem is that although you know which team you're on, you don't know which of the other players are also on your team and which are on the other team!&#10;&#10;Further, in Exodus: Paris Nouveau, you win or lose as a team. Throughout the game, you use abilities, deduction, and guesswork to determine your team members, and together strive to win as a team. The game may end in a number of ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a player has no life tokens, the game immediately ends. That player reveals their secret ID card and their team loses, resulting in a win for the other team. &#10;    The hunters win (and the rescuers lose) immediately if no cover tokens remain in the game. &#10;    The hunters win (and the rescuers lose) immediately if the total hunter distance (i.e., the sum of the distance values on all face-up cards in the hunter line) equals or exceeds the total rescuer distance (i.e., the number of distance tokens remaining in the game plus the sum of the distance values on all face-up cards in the rescuer line).&#10;    If the game hasn't ended beforehand, it concludes at the end of the seventh round. In this case, the rescuer's team score is the number of victory point icons on the face-up cards in the rescuer line (i.e., each running figure symbol is worth one victory point), and the hunter's team score is the number of victory point icons on the face-up cards in the hunter line. Whichever team has the higher score wins.&#10;    If scores are tied, continue playing rounds until either an immediate-win condition has been met or at the end of a round one team has a higher score than the other, at which point they're declared the winning team.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Through command of their skeletal minions gathered in the Nexus, players will battle against one another in a struggle to control six portals and channel the energy that manifests within them. As players channel the four different strains of dark arcana from the portals, they will enhance their powers through invoking and forging unholy pacts with demons gathered beyond the breach. Each demonic pact moves a player towards victory through accumulation of points of blasphemy.&#10;&#10;     Roll dice to see which portal (which is marked by different symbols) gets resources. Your dice determine the color of resources as well as the portal. &#10;     Roll dice to see where your first skeleton will travel to. Initially this move means nothing, but as more of your skeletons invade the board you'll have to roll a higher number on the threshold to allow a new skeleton to enter the arena. &#10;     Once your skeleton is on the board they can move to any other portal they choose. Later on in the game when multiple skeletons are in play players can spend a blue resource to move an additional skeleton.&#10;     If two players have a skeleton on the same spot, a player can roll dice and see if they can kill the opposing skeleton. The attacker will need to roll a 4 or higher on a six-sided die to defeat the opposing skeleton, and the defender will roll a D4. If the defender rolls a 4, they will kill the attacking skeleton. In later rounds, players can use a black resource to attack more skeletons.&#10;     Player will then roll a D4 to determine how many resources they can pluck from their portal. &#10;     Player can then choose to bank their resources and hold them until their next turn, or spend it on a demon in the pool. Each demon has different values and purchasing a demon will eventually allow you to unlock pacts which grant you points as well as additional abilities throughout the game. Pacts are only unlocked when a player successfully gains a pair of demons from the same color scheme.&#10;     Next player moves...&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "My Favorite Carrera RS is a &quot;must not follow&quot; trick-taking card game for 3-5 players based on the Japanese manga &#229;&#189;&#188;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#169;, a.k.a. My Favorite Carrera. The game has six suits of cards ranked 1-5, with two differently suited versions of the 4-ranked card. Each rank is its own suit, e.g., all 1s are yellow, all 2s are blue, etc.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a game, each player has six cards and five fuel chips. The lead player of a trick plays a card from their hand, then in turn order, the following players each play a card of their choice to the trick with the caveat that no two cards can be of the same suit. The rank on a played card represents the speed of the player's race car. When playing a card, the player can place any number of fuel chips from their reserve on the card to increase its rank by 1 per chip. The player whose card rank is the highest wins the trick and receives a momentum token, then leads the next trick. Momentum tokens can be thought of as permanent fuel chips; when a player plays a card to a trick after having won any momentum token(s), their card rank will automatically be +1 per momentum token they have in their possession.&#10;&#10;When a player cannot play a card of a unique suit to a trick, they play a card of choice face down. Note that a player can also choose to play a card face down even if they could play a unique suit. This card's rank is 0, and momentum tokens and fuel chips have no effect. After determining the trick winner, all players who have played face down refill their fuel chips, splitting all of the fuel chips played on previous tricks as evenly as possible. If a player now has more than five fuel chips, they discard the excess from the game. (Any chips that could not be divided evenly are also discarded from the game.)&#10;&#10;The final trick of a round is the most important trick as that round's winner receives a trophy token, then a new round begins, with all players discarding their momentum tokens and keeping their fuel tokens; all fuel chips in the market remain there. Whoever won the final trick of the previous round is the first lead player. The game continues until one player earns a second trophy token and wins.&#10;&#10;Twists: Small card powers.&#10;&#10;-Cards ranked 1 will turn rank 4 or 5 cards to 0 when assessing the trick. However, any momentum tokens and fuel chips on the affected cards still increase their rank by the normal +1 per.&#10;&#10;-Cards ranked 2 will allow a player to immediately take a single fuel chip from the market upon playing the card. The player may even immediately use this fuel chip to increase the rank of their card, however, if this chip would exceed their fuel chip limit of five they must discard the chip from the game.&#10;&#10;",

Most of the core mechanisms are identical to Pax Pamir, though some have been tweaked to fit more appropriately to the Expanse setting.&#10;&#10;In the game, 3-4 players act as powerful puppetmasters acting behind the scenes of the Solar System, manipulating the three main factions to their own advantage: The United Nations, the Mars Congressional Republic and the Outer Planets Alliance.  All while mysterious events are occurring due to the arrival of the extraterrestrial Protomolecule.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is mostly in the form of area control.  However, each area of the board can be controlled in two different ways (often simultaneously): a faction can control a region by having the most fleets and transports there, whereas a player can control a region by having the most supporters and fleets of a faction they are loyal to present.  Four scoring phases occur throughout the course of the game, and the method of scoring is determined by whether any one of the three factions is in dominance when the scoring occurs.  If so, then players loyal to the dominant faction will score victory points.  If not, then players score victory points based on their individual power and presence on the board.&#10;&#10;Players can increase their power and abilities by purchasing asset cards from a communal market using influence, the game's currency.  Each asset grants its controller particular actions and abilities, and at any particular time one of the four types of cards - Military, Subterfuge, Political or Economic - will be able to perform their actions for free based on the current political climate.&#10;&#10;Players must acquire the most powerful assets, ally themselves with the ascendant factions, and make deals with other players to secure their positions on the board and score the most victory points when the scoring phases occur.  After four scoring phases, the player with the most victory points is the winner!&#10;&#10;Cole Wehrle (designer of the original Pax Pamir) has indicated that he has no objection to the files for this game being shared on BGG.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A patrol had mistakenly reported a rebel camp ripe for raiding so Stone, in turn, ordered Colonel Deven to advance on the supposed camp. Having done so, Deven found nothing of the kind. Confused, he settled his men in a defensive position and awaited new orders. Stone decided to send the remainder of the 15th Massachusetts, With Colonel Edward Baker in command, across the river so that he might conduct a reconnaissance in force around Leesburg, VA. A sharp engagement ensued with Baker calling for more reinforcements. The army strength on both sides grew to approximately 1700 men.&#10;&#10;Colonel Baker was killed late in the afternoon during a failed attack on the rebel line. Before long, disorganized federal troops were recrossing the river. By early evening The 18th Mississippi arrived and aided in an assault that fully routed the boys in blue. Their artillery abandoned, many Union soldiers were forced down the steep slope called Ball's Bluff and into the river. Soldiers swarmed the waiting boats. Overcrowded, several boats capsized on their way back to Harrison Island. An untold number of Federals drowned in their desperate attempt to escape. By day&rsquo;s end, 223 Union men were killed, 226 were wounded, and 553 were trapped and captured by the advancing rebels. In all, the rebels lost 36 KIA, 264 WIA, and 3 captured for a total of 303 &ndash; killed, wounded and captured.&#10;&#10;Ball's Bluff is a hex-based, chit-pull system game using company sized units. It features low complexity rules and low counter density - 103 pieces. The map has been drawn by famed Civil War map creator, Rick Barber and covers the area immediately surrounding Ball's Bluff. The action represented covers only the heavy fighting which took place from the early afternoon on. Playtime, once the rules are understood will average two hours or less.&#10;&#10;",

To capture this second capital of Russia and the birthplace of Soviet communism would deal a severe psychological blow to the enemy, protect the northern flank of Army Group Center, and bring an overland route into Finland, Germany&rsquo;s Axis ally in the north. Hitler would obsess on the capture of Leningrad.&#10;&#10;Taking Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in their Baltic drive, as well as the north regions of Byelorussia, the Germans found themselves facing stubborn resistance from the Red Army and the Soviet Baltic Sea Fleet. Several Soviet counteroffensives were launched, but the Baltic States were soon overrun and operational objectives such as Talinin eventually fell to the German Blitzkrieg. The Soviets would improvise defensive barriers like the Luga Line, but Germans kept coming...&#10;&#10;Target: Leningrad is a new game from legendary game designer Frank Chadwick, iterating the Campaigns in Russia game system used in Battle for Moscow, The Arduous Beginning: The Attack of Army Group Center June - August 1941 and Objective: Kiev  (The Advance of Army Group South: June-August, 1941). Featuring countless opportunities and variations, Target: Leningrad presents an endlessly fascinating series of puzzles, filled with rich historical narrative in every move, as Leningrad becomes the focus of this great campaign.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 2.5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 8 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is one German corps or Soviet army or corps, and each turn is approximately eight days.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&bull; One 6-page, color  Standard Rules booklet&#10;&bull; 32 color, two-sided die-cut 5/8&rdquo; mounted pieces&#10;&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color game map with tables&#10;&bull; 1 Player Aid sheet&#10;&#10;",

This takes the form of dice, chaos cards and a choice of spells to alter the flow of the game. Because during conflict - just as in life - nothing is static and linear. And so, while playing, you'll have to learn to change your tactics to suit the altered conditions of the game as it progresses.&#10;&#10;",

They&rsquo;ll enter dungeons as you command, clashing with their rivals, battling for loot all while navigating the enchantments left by the necromancer.

Where you start with a double domino.  You play 10 rounds, each round starts with a different double domino working your way down from double-nine to double-blank.  You must first fill the double chickenfoot with the 8 tiles that go around it. If you can't fill you must draw a new tile, it is like Uno in this aspect.  Once the chickenfoot is played you may play a new domino, either putting a number against a number or playing a double tile in a T arrangement across another domino, this becomes a new chickenfoot and must be filled before continuing, a player draws a tile if they can't finish the Chickenfoot.  The round ends when one player has no tile, or there are no tiles left to play on a chickenfoot.&#10;&#10;A fun game that can be played by gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;&#10;",

American forces from off-map transports assault the beach. Those units not swamped during the approach attempt to move up the beach toward the German-occupied bluffs, clearing obstacles as they advance.   Some units (tanks, sharpshooters, bazookas) execute ranged fire at fortified German units.  Naval Forward Observers guide ship-to-shore fire support.   The Player&rsquo;s assault force faces German defensive fire (solitaire, system-controlled) from machine guns and anti-tank emplacements, panzerfaust and rifle fire, as well as off-map German artillery.  When the bluffs are reached, American units must clear the trenches by assault. The game tension is visceral as your brave Joes are pinned down or hit by the intense German fire. You&rsquo;ll grit your teeth as a Combat Engineer team deploys Bangalore torpedoes to clear obstacles while under fire, and cheer when a German unit is taken out by a tank or by a ship&rsquo;s guns directed by one of your forward observers. How many sections of German trench will your men be able to clear in the twelve, heart-pounding game turns? Will you be a private or a colonel at the end of the game?

Simply put, it&rsquo;s a chance to play an entire race (not just a ship or fleet) and conduct an entire war one step at a time. You&rsquo;ll colonize planets, manage resources, build ships, capture territory, and negotiate with your neighbors. The ultimate aim of a campaign can be as straightforward as galactic dominance. Although this can be achieved in other ways such as accomplishment of a set of predefined victory conditions.&#10;&#10;VBAM has been designed in such a way that you can use any background setting for your campaign. The primary goal of the master book is to provide the basic structure and rules to handle campaign-level issues. The campaign guide is designed to offer the players a variety of choices in complexity and style of play. It can be played by itself as a stand alone game using our quick space and ground combat resolution system with the included source materials or used with more complex tactical combat systems with source materials that you already own.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Victory by Any Means: Campaign Moderator's Companion&#10;    Victory by Any Means: Jovian Chronicles&#10;    Victory by Any Means: The Starmada Edition&#10;    Stars Divided: Terran Civil War (Victory by Any Means: The Starmada Edition also required)&#10;    Victory by Any Means Source: Wars of the Kuissians and Boltians&#10;    Victory by Any Means: The Menagerie&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Different options exist for various units (for example, cavalry can be dismounted to create men-at-arms.)&#10;&#10;Each game in the PRESTAGS series shares a set of the same common rules.

As soon as you launch a tiny secret project, hordes of fighters in party-colored tights come out of nowhere and dismantle it into small screws. How unfair!&#10;&#10;Now everything is different. The former 'guardians of mankind' have quarreled into pieces, squabbled, and perished into thin air. Good riddance! The horizon is clear, so my time has come! The time of a genius, merciless, and of course unbelievably vile supervillain &mdash; actually, at this point, just a villain because there are stupid, spineless, and cowardly other villains who also seek world domination. It's time to put an end to this. This morning I have finally realized that. This galaxy shall be mine!&#10;&#10;Supervillain: This Galaxy Is Mine! is an intense card-based strategy game of galactic domination inspired by all sci-fi worlds put together and fueled with frenzied humor. Each player becomes a villain, and you have to overcome other villains and conquer the galaxy! To do this, you use two universal card decks &mdash; the domination deck and the minion deck &mdash; and in each deck, each card may be used in multiple ways.&#10;&#10;You may launch a domination card as an asteroid at another villain. The asteroid would disrupt their plans and possibly kill their minions &mdash; and if you charge your asteroid (using minion ops), it can blow up everything! Or you may take a domination card as a project to build. Every project has a minor ability. Upon completion, the project transforms into a secret facility and its major ability comes into effect, providing you with new tactical opportunities.&#10;&#10;You also command millions of loyal minions who are not too smart &mdash; but they are devoted and diligent! You can use a minion card in two ways: You may put a minion card on your project as a minion mob to build it, or you can discard it as minion ops to perform a special operation. For instance, you may shoot down or charge an asteroid, destroy a mob or a project, increase the building capabilities of your mobs, and so on.&#10;&#10;Secret facilities bring you domination points, and a villain who acquires five domination points immediately becomes the supervillain and is proclaimed &quot;Emperor of the Galaxy&quot;, winning the game as well.&#10;&#10;Team play is possible, and with two copies of the game up to six players can compete at the same time.&#10;&#10;",

Settlements, cities, and roads earn their owners victory points (VPs), and the first player to have ten VPs wins.&#10;&#10;Where Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg Catan differs from some Catan games &ndash; yet is similar to others, such as Catan Geographies: Germany &ndash; is that the game board features the southwestern state of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg (with fixed resource numbers on the locations) and players can build key landmarks within the state, such as the Stuttgarter Fernsehturm or Heidelberg Castle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Struggle between the Russian and Ottoman Empires was already centuries old when war broke out in 1877. It had its origins in the bitter conflict between Muslims and Christians, Slavs and Turks. The war proved to be a turning point in that it completely altered the balance of power in the east. In less than 40 years this helped produce the European catastrophe known as the Great War (WW I). Echoes of these ethnic and religious troubles resound today, as the peoples of Balkans and Near East still fight each other in a struggle for dominance. The Russo-Turkish War did not just cripple the Ottoman Empire. It made Russia into the dominant power in the East, and demonstrated the twin impact of modern technology and modern ideology on warfare.&#10;&#10;The System rules apply to all games in the Wars of the Imperial Age series, and simulate the conditions of warfare in the late 19th century. This is a revision of the System rules presented with Franco-Prussian War (S&amp;T #149), and completely replaces the System rules book found there. Important changes from the original version are indicated by a double pound sign (##) at the beginning of the rule. Players familiarizing themselves with the game may wish to use just the System rules. The Specific Rules that apply only to the particular game and cover military and political conditions unique to the specific situation.&#10;Units represent historical leaders and headquarters staffs; corps, division-, and brigade-sized units; and fortifications. Each unit is rated for its combat strength, training class, and movement ability. (Specific Rules) Additionally, headquarters are rated for their Operations capability to enhance movement and combat capabilities, as well as conduct various politically oriented functions.&#10;&#10;All units are deployed face down, and are revealed to the enemy only if he conducts reconnaissance or intelligence operations. Movement is performed by the moving force rolling on one of four March tables (Regular March, Forced March, Railroad, Naval) and applying the result. Combat is fought between enemy units in individual adjacent hexes; each player draws a Battle Results marker at random. This gives the number of enemy combat factors eliminated, effects on enemy morale, and special results for cavalry, and siege guns.The typical size of units are brigades.&#10;&#10;Politics are a factor in the game. Each side has a National Will Index which gives the current level of popular support. This is affected by combat outcomes and other game events. (Specific Rules) Each turn, players have the opportunity to draw Political Events markers, representing various factors affecting the outcome of the conflict.&#10; Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #154, Sep 1992.  Errata was published in S&amp;T #157 &amp; 159.&#10;Replacement counters were issued in S&amp;T #162 (2 counters) and S&amp;T #171 (1 counter).&#10;&#10;",

Fighting rages from St. Petersburg to Verdun to Baghdad and beyond. The maps can be combined for one grand game of the Great War, or they may be used separately for theater-level campaigns of the eastern front, the western front and the Middle East. The game rules use a modular approach, which allows players to employ the level of complexity they desire. Turns are quarterly, but players can use special campaign cards to provide additional move-fight impulses, recreating the intensive offensives of the war. There are scenarios for each year and each front of the war, as well as a grand game for the entire war. There is also a &quot;what if&quot; scenario for the war continuing into 1919.&#10;&#10;Units represent land, naval and air forces. Ground forces are portrayed at corps level. Each corps is rated for the number of divisions it includes; so players can concentrate for the offensive or disperse for the defense. Corps include infantry, shock troops, mountain infantry and cavalry. There are also specialized armored car and tank brigades, as well as tank corps for 1919, plus the planned-for American airborne division. Each country has its own unique order of battle so, for example, the Austro-Hungarians have mountain corps, and there are also additional units representing Bolshevik and independent nationalist forces.&#10;&#10;Naval units are at the squadron level for capital ships, and flotillas for cruisers and destroyers. There is also a complete submarine warfare module for attacks on merchant shipping. Air warfare is represented by strategic and tactical wings. A unique feature of the game is players can improve their aerial warfare capabilities by increasing their air doctrine level. As air doctrine improves, players can employ interception, aerial supply and aircraft carrier operations. On the subversive side, players can utilize agents to conduct propaganda and sabotage operations to undermine their foes from within.&#10;&#10;Land combat uses three different combat results tables to model different tactics. Tank and shock troop units can use the much more effective Infiltration CRT. Naval combat requires opposing fleets to first acquire each other, then engage in gunnery. Lighter fleet units become invaluable for recon and screening, while battleships and battlecruiser squadrons close in for the kill. In the air, players can execute a variety of missions, including air superiority and bombardment.&#10;&#10;An industrial production module gives players the capability to produce different types of forces. Production is tied to morale, and winning great battles will enhance your side's output while a disastrous defeat may lead to strikes on the home front. Storm of Steel uses a card system to generate major operations. Campaign cards give players additional move-fight impulses, combat bonuses and extra reinforcements. Players have to carefully choose which campaigns they will implement because some cards, such as the Schlieffen Plan, will provide for more maneuver, while others, such as Verdun, will enhance combat. There are also cards that will grant tactical innovations such as chemical warfare and armored doctrine, as well as bringing into play leaders such as Hindenburg, Brusilov and Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Build your army. Crush your friends.&#10;&#10;REINFORCEMENTS is a strategic battle card game where 2 -4  players build up powerful armies and compete to be the last one standing. It&rsquo;s a simple card game that&rsquo;s easy to learn but packs a board game punch! Each player takes turns drawing from a shared deck containing cards from 3 distinct kingdoms, each with unique art and special abilities. Using these cards players build up their army to unlock additional actions and attack their foes using powerful combos. In Reinforcements you can blast your foes with magic, hire deadly mercenaries, incite a peasant mob, and summon mythical totems. When two cards of the same power collide, it's time to call in REINFORCEMENTS! Both player&rsquo;s shout exuberantly and draw two cards from the deck to decide the battle. Do you have what it takes be the last player standing?&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a handful of five cards and three face-down Foundations (selected during setup). On your turn, you can do one of three things: use a card in your hand to Attack the lead card in one of your opponents &quot;stacks&quot;, Defend your foundations by adding a card that matches the suit of that foundation from your hand to the &quot;stack&quot;, or Discard as many cards from your hand as you want (you will fill back up to begin your next turn.)&#10;&#10;Once you add a third card to a stack, that stack is turned face up and you draw a card from the top of the draw pile to start a new foundation. Having a faceup stack will give you a bonus depending on the suit. A faceup stack of Blue cards allows you to Fortify which lets you take an additional Defend action on your turn if you have a blue card in hand that you can place. A faceup stack of Red cards allows you to Barrage your opponent by allowing you and additional attack on your opponent each turn if you have a red card in hand. Finally, a faceup Green stack gives you the ability to Adapt by either swapping a green card from your hand with a green card from the stack or swapping the position of two of the green cards in your faceup stack.&#10;&#10;Each color of stack that is face up grants you these abilities, so they can add up quickly and each color that's face up also gives you a passive ability: blue - your blue stacks may now have 4 cards instead of just 3, red - red cards that attack or Barrage automatically win all ties, green - your hand size increases by 1 for every faceup green stack in your army. Cards range in value from 1-7 and it's a basic war mechanic that higher card beats lower card, however if you win a battle (i.e. your six beats your opponents' two) any extra points carry on to the next card in the line (in the example you would have four points left to face whatever card was next in line.)&#10;&#10;If there is a tie both players yell &ldquo;REINFORCEMENTS!!!&rdquo; Each player MUST yell this when a tie occurs. This rule is non negotiable. Players draw the top card off of the draw pile and flip them until the battle is resolved. There are also some special cards that truly mess things up (Assassins, Mages, and mobs of Peasants) and if you flip two stacks of one color or one stack of each color (three stacks in total) one of the Totems will visit you and provide a special power. But you have to use it before an opponent completes their requirement and steals the Totem from you.&#10;&#10;",

The game is to divide the treasury between the players and when the treasury is empty, the winner is the player who has more coins in her hands.&#10;In the beginning, the cards are drawn in front of players and the player with King starts the game.&#10;The starting player shuffles the cards and places all 6 cards from the back on the table. In all games from 3 to 6 players every 6 character cards should be placed on the table and every player has a card. So in 3, 4 or 5 player game, there are 3, 2 or one card which is not owned by any player but they have their spot in the game.&#10;Before the start, every player can see one card except the one she owns.&#10;Then the game starts!&#10;Every player can do 3 things on her turn:&#10;&#10;     Rotate the cards: by saying &ldquo;to right&rdquo; every card goes to the spot in its right. By saying &ldquo;to left&rdquo; we do the same to the left. And by saying &ldquo;to the counter card&rdquo; every card goes to the spot in the counterpoint (which means the 3rd card from the left or the right).&#10;     Pay a coin to the treasure and see her card.&#10;     Claim a character and act!&#10;&#10;&#10;Character Acts:&#10;King: Says &ldquo;Who is the minister?&rdquo; and takes 3 coins from the treasury. Then another player can claim he is the Minister, say &ldquo;Yes Sir&rdquo; and take one coin.&#10;Thief: Takes one coin from the player in his right and one from his left. If any of them is out of coin, takes from the treasury instead.&#10;Minister: He can take any 2 cards and shuffle them under the table without seeing them and place them back.&#10;Executioner: He attempts to kill one player by calling his character card. The victim should check his card. If executioner was right, takes all the victim&rsquo;s coins.&#10;Sheriff: Says &ldquo;Pay Tax&rdquo; and all players should pay one coin to the treasury. As sheriff doesn&rsquo;t pay tax, chooses one player and says &ldquo;You pay 2&rdquo; and that player should pay 2 coins. If you are out of coins, you shouldn&rsquo;t pay tax.&#10;Peasant: She can show her card and say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peasant&rdquo;. Then she should say the character of all players and take all the coins remaining in the treasure. If she gets wrong, she should pay 2 coins to the treasury and the game continues.&#10;When a player claims a character, another player can challenge her. In this case player 1 gives her card to player 2 and He checks the card. If player 1 was right, player 2 should pay one coin to the treasury. If he was wrong, the game continues.&#10;Whenever the treasury got empty, the game is over and player who has more coin than others is the Winner!&#10;&#10;",

The scale for the system will be 10 miles a hex and weekly turns, with Divisions as the primary maneuver unit.&#10;&#10;Using at its heart a system that is from an older but wonderfully conceived game called &ldquo;Road to the Rhine&rdquo;, players will be able to move all their units once but can, if they can afford the supply cost, move the still unmoved units impulse after impulse. The opposing player will have to maintain adequate reserves to counter this.&#10;The grand campaign game covers the first year of the war.&#10;&#10;Using a moderately complex rule set, players will be able to concentrate on the play and not the rules. Keeping your units well supplied will be the key to victory &ndash; but as you advance, you&rsquo;ll see your supply situation deteriorate.

Also covered are the epic F-86 versus MiG-15 battles, political limitations of surrogate wars, possible Soviet intervention, possible nuclear weapons, and of course, the United States Navy &ndash; for both support and invasions.&#10;&#10;There will be scenarios covering various sized battles and campaigns (with a play time of 2 to 20 hours), as well as a grand campaign game for players that want it all.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 6 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 1 week per turn&#10;Map Scale: 7 miles a hex&#10;Players: 1-4&#10;Playing Time: 2-60 hours&#10;Designer: Adam Starkweather&#10;Artist: Ilya Kudryashov&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;One 48 page rulebook&#10;One 24 page scenario book&#10;Three 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo; maps&#10;Five Displays and Charts&#10;Two 9/16ths Countersheets&#10;4 Dice&#10;Game Box&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A fantasy Miniatures game based on Legend of the Five Rings, which combines a use of a card deck with a d10 based rolling system.  It is based on a fantasy setting heavily influenced by feudal Japan with Samurai of various clans fighting to support their lord's quest to become Emperor. There are also shugenja (mages), Dragons, Naga, and hordes of evil demons (Oni). You get a certain number of points to build an army, and armies must typically have units that are either from the same clan or unaligned. You can be units from other clans, but they cost a premium (usually 20% above list price).  Typically, personalities lead units, which is some number of basic troops (usually samurai). A good personality can cost as much as 30 or 40 basic troops, but most cost around 10 times more. Leaders, and occasionally units, have skills. Skills are used to modify initiatives, absorb damage, boost morale, and the like. Many personalities (and some units) also have skills that are unique to that personality / unit.&#10;&#10;In addition to the units, each player also has a customized deck of thirty cards. These cards let the player make special moves, pass morale tests, and do other acts of courage. Each player builds their own deck (just like in a collectable card game) and typically draws a card a turn, although one player gets to draw two. Since a game lasts about 6-10 turns, a player should expect to see 1/3 rd to 1/2 of their deck (you start with three cards) in a battle.&#10;&#10;After setting up, a turn looks like the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Determine Initiatives,&#10;     Do Special Action/Orders,&#10;     Move,&#10;     Cavalry Move Again,&#10;     Shoot,&#10;     Fight,&#10;     Reserve Movement.&#10;&#10;&#10;(Detail from the review by Bankler: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/68739/clan-war-review)&#10;&#10;",

Vigilus is at the mercy of five warring factions: Ultramarines, Orks, Chaos Space Marines, Aeldari Craftworlds, and Genestealer Cults, each represented by tokens for their leaders and custom game pieces for their single and triple-threat units.&#10;&#10;To name a few, Marneus Calgar leads the Ultramarines with individual Primaris Intercessors and Repulsor battle tanks as their three-unit pieces. The Aeldari Craftworlds faction, led by an Autarch, has Guardians at attention with Falcons as their tanks. A Magus's Genestealer Cult boasts weapon-wielding Acolytes and heavily armored Goliath Rockgrinders. All five factions' leaders have various special abilities, while armies are deployed with daring attacks and defense at the roll of custom red and black dice. Players gain reward cards for completing objectives, allowing the acquisition of additional armies and providing strategic advantages. Conquer not only three objectives, but total control of all territories to win &quot;Total Domination&quot;!&#10;&#10;",

They fight over provinces in quarterly turns. Combat can be fought tactically, using a separate display reminiscent of the way of resolving combat in Eagle games, with units assigned to various sections of the battlefield. Units which survive tactical combat can lay siege to cities.&#10;&#10;The game can last varying numbers of turns, depending on the course of the war. There are several conditions, including the death of leaders and conquest of overwhelming numbers of provinces, that can end the game early. Otherwise the game ends in the summer of 323 (when Alexander actually died) or in an optional scenario, keep going up until 318 if Alexander survives that long.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vive l'Empereur Series - Vol. IX&#10;&#10;Vive l'Empereur Series is a simulation of the battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;J&eacute;na, fought on 14 October 1806, is the turning point of the 1806 campaign against Prussia. Eventually a crushing French victory, starting in the fog by Lannes engaging a single Prussian division under Tauentzien, it escalated into a full battle against Hohenlohe and half of the Prussian army, at first not fully grasping what he was facing, engaging his army piece-meal. While starting outnumbered, the French are at the top of their military value and the masterful&nbsp;concentration of the army during the day makes J&eacute;na&nbsp;the epitome of victories.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Auerstaedt, was fought on the same day, opposing Davout and his Third corps to the main Prussian army under Brunswick and the King of Prussia. An unexpected battle, as more troops enter the battlefield on both sides, a masterpiece where Davout earned his title of Duke of Auerstaedt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of that day, the two Prussian armies, both beaten in this double battle, join in a common rout, followed by a legendary pursuit lead by Murat to the destruction of the arrogant Prussian army in a few weeks. &nbsp;&#10; Both battles comes with many what-ifs and a total of 15 scenarios, using troops from both armies not historically engaged. Several scenarios give finally a real chance to the unlucky Prussians.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Le si&egrave;ge de Danzig,&nbsp;simulates the siege of the great fortress of Danzig between March and May 1807, between the Eylau part of the campaign of Poland and its conclusion at Friedland. It is played on two maps, an operational map of the region of Danzig, using the regular Vive l&rsquo;Empereur rules, and a siege map where the French player will build a siege network to get closer to the mighty walls to breach them. A lot happens on both maps, sorties, relief Russian forces under Kamenski, the Danzig morale that conditions victory goes up and down depending on the progress of the siege works and other events. The players will have to be patient, the siege can be won or lost on the last turn of play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Head-to-Head Poker is a 2-player game that gives a good, fun introduction to Poker without the stress of betting or bluffing. The rules give 5 variations of play, such as simply drawing one card and playing it, or drawing two, choosing one to play on your side and giving your opponent the other and so on. A die is rolled to determine how each hand will be played. The game is played in 3 rounds, and 3-5 cards are turned up at the start of each round and get $200 in chips placed on them. Players take turns to lay up to 4 more cards on their side, to make the best 5 card hand they can. In this way, the original face-up card on each row is shared by the players, and you can easily see what you need to play to beat your opponent's hand.&#10;&#10;When the rows are complete, the player who has the winning hand on each row takes the chips in the middle. After playing the simple version, players can then use the betting rules, which let them raise the betting on the center cards. This makes the game more tense and more fun as the stakes are raised. Can you play the right card to beat your opponent and win $100s?&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Head-to-Head Poker Game Parker Brothers and Hasbro Games.&#10;Build the best hand in this poker duel!

Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 mini-maps located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating mini-games in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.&#10;&#10;The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.&#10;&#10;The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.&#10;&#10;The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake.

    "Description": "In ONDA, players use cards from their hands to compose wave formations superior to those of their opponents according to the current tide. Your goal is to be the first to play all your cards; failing that, try to have as few cards as possible since you lose points based on what's left in your hand.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the start of play the tide is coming in, that is, high numbers are better than low. In each round, each player starts with a hand of cards, placing two cards face down in front of them; these cards are now wild and still considered part of their hand. To start the trick, the lead player plays a formation consisting of a single card, 2-4 cards of the same value, or a sequence of 2-4 cards. Subsequent players can (1) play a better formation &mdash; &quot;better&quot; being determined by the tide &mdash; (2) pass and be out of the trick, (3) turn the tide by returning one of their face-down cards to their hand, flipping the tide card (so now low numbers are better than high, or vice versa), then playing a better combination, or (4) play a bomb.&#10;&#10;Six types of bombs exist in ONDA, and the current bomb type is shown on top of the bomb deck. A bomb, e.g., a two-card sequence in the same suit, supersedes the current formation, and once played players must beat this formation instead of the previous one. At most one bomb can be played in a trick, and only one player can turn the tide.&#10;&#10;Once all but one player have passed in a trick, clear all played cards and move the top bomb card to the bottom of that deck. Whoever last played leads a new formation. Once a player has no cards in hand &mdash; regardless of face-down cards on the table &mdash; the round ends, and everyone but that player loses points based on their unplayed cards.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",
