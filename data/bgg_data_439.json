    "Description": "This chess variation uses the traditional pieces but is played on a board with a different topology: it's as if the board were pinched together in the middle, or as if the board were centered over the north pole of a globe, so all moves from the 4th to 5th rank pass through the center point.  There is an extra file that prevents the two player's rooks from being adjacent; you cannot move through the outer two ranks of the file, you can move through but not stop in their inner two ranks. Diagonal moves for the bishops and queens are defined so that they make S-curves after passing through the center point, allowing for attacks that are hard to spot until you get used to them.&#10;&#10;This set comes with a 2-sided board, a standard 8x8 board being on the other side; and it includes a checker set, so you can play Centre Checkers as well.  Rules are included for all 4 games, chess and checkers, traditional and Centre.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Board Talk is a letter-by-letter word card game that uses a board for building up one's hand.  During their turns, players roll 2 dice and move around the board.  The space they land on allows them to get cards (1-3), lose a card, or use a particular letter with their cards to form a word.  You may end the round by calling a word if it is 4 letters or longer.  Similar to gin rummy, you get the points for the word you call only if it isn't beaten by another player.  If beaten, the higher player gets your points *plus* his.  After the scoring, the board and cards are reset, and another round starts.  The winner is the first to reach the total point goal.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game combines card and board play.  At its heart, it's a letter-by-letter word game, where you spell words from your hand to get points.  The Spellway track of the board keeps track of your total points, and the game is won by reaching the castle at the end of the track.&#10;&#10;Several other features make it more like a board game race:&#10;&#10;a) What you can do in your turn is determined by rolling a die and moving a shared piece around the S-track: you may draw 1-3 cards, discard a card, lay down a word, or draw a Spoiler card.  Several junctions allow choices of play.&#10;&#10;b) The Spoiler cards allow you to give and/or take letter cards from other players.&#10;&#10;c) The Spellway track has some spaces that let you try to spell a random word on a Speller card, for 5 extra points.  There are 2 levels of cards so different ages can play together.&#10;&#10;d) If you play all your cards to spell a word, all the other players move back 1 space per card they hold, up to 3 max.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Juggernauts is a customizable, non-collectible dueling game for two players, each with his or her own customized deck.  Your deck represents your Juggernaut.  Your opponent also has a Juggernaut. Your goal is to incapacitate your opponent&rsquo;s Juggernaut so your ground forces can infiltrate and overwhelm it before he or she can do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, you need to download and print out Juggernauts cards and build your deck.  Cards fall into general categories of power generators, attacks, defenses, and miscellaneous effects.&#10;&#10;At the start of a game:&#10;&#10;     Pick a standard polyhedral die to be your Juggernaut's Commander.&#10;     Draw cards equal to the number of sides on your Commander, plus three.&#10;     Lay out all but three of the cards in your hand face-down so that each card:&#10;         occupies one square in an imaginary grid, and&#10;         is adjacent to at least one card.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;This matrix of cards is your Juggernaut.  Face-down cards are inactive nodes and face-up cards are active nodes.&#10;&#10;Play during a game is simultaneous; you and your opponent go through the same phases in a turn at the same time.  You  start your turn by gaining 1 power (plus any additional from active cards in your Juggernaut).  You use power to:&#10;&#10;     Activate cards that require Power,&#10;     Increase the effectiveness of an attack or defense,&#10;     Maintain cards you want to keep&#10;&#10;&#10;After you gain power, you roll your Commander to see which card in your Juggernaut's matrix activates.  If you do not have an active card by the end of your command phase (this can happen if your Commander tries to activate a damaged sector, a neutralized card, or a card token), put an alert token on your deck. This means that your enemy&rsquo;s ground forces are approaching. Remove all alert tokens when you activate a damaged sector. If you have three or more alert tokens on your deck at the end of a round, enemy troops have infiltrated your juggernaut and taken control. You lose and your opponent wins.&#10;&#10;Next, you and your opponent reveal your active cards and resolve them.  Once cards resolve, you discard them, draw cards to replace them, then play cards from your hand to fill in the ones that you discarded.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are such that large Juggernauts with many-sided Commanders (d 12, d 20) have lots of &quot;hit points&quot;, but are easy to hit with attacks, difficult to get reliable results from, and vulnerable to accumulating alert tokens.  Small Juggernauts with few-sided Commanders (d4, d6) are difficult to hit and produce very predictable results, but have very few &quot;hit points&quot;.&#10;&#10;Juggernauts is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License.

Reference charts, a protractor and turning templates are included, as are templates of each ship with their game characteristics.&#10;&#10;The rules themselves are very similar to Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War, different values are used and special rules have been added (some that can be applied to Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War). The rules include an extensive list of naval vessels from 20 countries, virtually all navies over the world of the time. This rules set covers an obscure, but colorful, period of history that is represented by very few games.&#10;&#10;",

First, it will provide you with many hours of fun as you try to outlive your opponents by keeping yourself as healthy as possible. You will begin the game as most people begin life; with a clean bill of health. Staying healthy and risk free won't always be so easy. As the game progresses, as in life, risk factors will increase. Some are predictable, some are not. Some are good for you, some are not. You may end up in the hospital, possibly more than once. Perhaps an operation will be necessary and you may find yourself in the operating room. If successful, you continue the game. If not, you'll find yourself in the I.C.U. Many twists and turns await all the players. In any event, you'll find yourself having loads of fun as you attempt to remain healthy. Secondly, it is intended to educate all players about many of the risk factors associated with heart disease and heart attacks in an attempt to help everyone minimize their risks for having these problems. It is our belief that learning is much more effective when it's fun. Although the information presented about heart disease and heart attacks is valuable information for everyone, this game is not intended to provide medical advice to anyone. Any person who believes they are at risk for these problems, should consult a doctor for specific and individualized treatment and advice.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Following on the heels of the first Squadron Pack for the Down in Flames series of WWII air combat card games comes Squadron Pack 2: Bombers. While the first pack contained new fighters, this one adds more Light Bombers and Formation aircraft to the  system.&#10;&#10;The pack will include such famous aircraft as the B-25H (complete with 75mm gun) and the Il-2m3 Shturmovik. But there will be lesser-known planes as well, like the German Hs-129B-1/R2 (a sort of WWII version of today's A-10) and the Italian CANT Z.501 Gabbiano flying boat. All the cards will be printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years.&#10;&#10;One of the difficulties in creating a pack of bombers and patrol planes is that up until now these aircraft types have only been used in the context of a Down in Flames campaign. The rules included in the pack provide three ways around this problem. First, there are guidelines for adding Formation aircraft to basic game dogfights. Second, the pack includes a number of stand-alone generic missions into which players can simply &quot;plug in&quot; appropriate aircraft. Finally, we have included rules (courtesy of Roger Horky) that allow Formation aircraft to engage in a form of dogfighting (called Gunnery Duels in the game) with other Formation planes. So if you've ever wanted to fly a Short Stirling against an FW-200 Condor, now is your chance.&#10;&#10;Squadron Pack 2's rules also contain reprints of some of the rules from Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who don't own that game (you know who you are). In addition, there are rules for two new ground attack weapons: the German Hs 293 radio-controlled air to surface missile and Fritz X radio-controlled glide bomb.&#10;&#10;Like the first pack, Squadron Pack 2: Bombers will contain 64 new aircraft cards printed 8 to a sheet in the same enhanced graphic style as Squadron Pack 1. The pack will also include a short (4-8 page) rulebook and an 11x17 wrap around cover decorated with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous artwork. The inside of the cover sheet will form a play mat for use during Gunnery Duels.&#10;&#10;Developers: Mike Lemick and Rodger B. MacGowan&#10;&#10;",

It was the last attempt to &quot;spill American blood&quot; in large quantities. Politically, the January attack was a success as the American media heavily reported it. Militarily, it had totally failed in the assigned objectives. For the August offensive, the NVA concentrated two divisions, the 5th and 9th. The 5th had grown to 15,000 men and elements of the plan called for the capture of American M113 APCs from the 10l ARVN squadron to infiltrate into the US headquarters for it's destruction. The plan also called for the divisions to be used piecemeal with the objective of killing Americans and occupying Tay Ninh City. Such an event would reap a political bonanza equal to the Tet Offensive. It was thought this would decimate US morale because War Zone C was well occupied by American troops. More important to the NVA plan was the hope that the awesome American airpower would be neutralized by the August monsoons. For the next 11 days, a hectic, fierce battle strung out the Americans and their M-48 tanks. When the NVA occupied over five city blocks of Tay Ninh, it was the worst nightmare for the US.&#10;&#10;Game contains:&#10;2 11x17 inch maps (which combines together)&#10;280 counters&#10;Player aids, charts and tables.&#10;&#10;Scale: company and platoon level, each hex 1/2 mile, each turn one day for a total of 11 turns.&#10;&#10;",

Those players get to move 3 free spaces on the board.&#10;&#10;Red is Impressions&#10;Blue is Art&#10;Yellow is Performance&#10;&#10;In the event that the Judge must read a Red, the players must do their best Impression of whatever is on the card. If the Judge reads an Yellow, the players must do their best Performance of whatever is on the card. When the Judge reads a Blue, the players use the sand timer and have 30 secs to Draw whatever is on the card.&#10;&#10;By the end of game play, all players will have had the chance to Judge, show their skills in all of the categories. Hilarity results from performing the said Idiosyncrasy successfully, as well as the attempts made along the way.&#10;&#10;The player who makes her way around the board to the end, first, wins the game. Keep in mind, Idiosyncrasies works very well with team play!&#10;&#10;",

You start the game with a standard poker deck, an Elemental Warriors II play sheet, and a limited number of coins.  The play sheet is divided into 10 columns (number 1 to 10) and 5 rows (labeled Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Combat).  Before the game begins, you allocate your coins to spaces on your play sheet.  During the game, you draw and play cards to activate columns on your play sheet.  Your combat value and any effects you generate are determined by the coins in the column you activate.  Earth effects tend to prevent damage.  Water effects tend to add coins to your play sheet.  Fire effects tend to deal damage to your opponent.  Air effects tend to let you move the coins on your play sheet or draw extra cards.  These special powers enable you to change your strategy during play and adapt to your opponent's behavior.  When you take damage, you lose coins from your play sheet.  If you surrender or run out of coins, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

Once all the players have revealed their maneuvers, players move their aircraft and then the shooting begins.&#10;&#10;The game provides for the use of air/flight stands to be used with miniatures, and is played on a hexmat large enough to hold several aircraft at a time. When planes are damaged, they are marked with either counters or specially made clips resembling smoke or fire.&#10;&#10;The Warbirds in Miniature Rules package comes with a 34 page rulebook, 2 double sided sets of charts, 2 double sided sample aircraft sheets, and a CD with over 50 Aircraft sheets covering all the major combat aircraft flown in World War 2. The CD also includes some early Jets for later World War 2 and for use in Korean War scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

The game package consists of a pack of 100 cards, plus a three-page instructional leaflet; 78 of the cards represent atoms or ions (H, O, etc.), 20 multipliers (two or three) while the remaining two are Mendeleef cards (jokers) that can be used to represent any other card except a multiplier.  The basic idea of the game is that pupils have to use the cards to make up chemical formulas.&quot;&#10;&#10;Taken from the book, A Handbook of Game Design, by Henry Ellington, Eric Addinall, and Fred Percival.

Just mix the 55 transparent cards in this new set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family - the malodorous Malone mob - including The Broken Arms Hotel as a Residence card to use with the Unhappy Homes expansion. When Boils Malone brought his family overseas to &ldquo;get away from the heat,&rdquo; he wasn&rsquo;t expecting quite so much rain!&#10;&#10;Adding an extra level of strategy, new persistent effect icons on cards allow their special effects to continue to be active even if covered by another card. A persistent effect ends only when the attached character is killed.&#10;&#10;Also inside are five Unwelcome Guest cards. Deal one or more face up to the table&rsquo;s center at the start of the game. Guests &ldquo;follow&rdquo; the card types noted on them; no matter where it currently is, a living Guest immediately moves to join the family of the character on which one of its &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; cards is played. All its Modifiers are moved with it, and it&rsquo;s considered a member of that family until it moves again. This may delay the game&rsquo;s end if a final play draws a Guest to the near-winner&rsquo;s family.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Enterprise is a real estate trading game, with some resemblance to Monopoly, but with elaborations. While it is designed in Australia, and uses a few Australian expressions, the content and theme are not noticeably Australian.&#10;&#10;The playing area is a simulation of a planned city, divided into two zones : an inner Residential ring and an outer Industrial ring. The play proceeds on a circular track, with each ring containing a series of &ldquo;sites&rdquo;, of which two aggregate to a &ldquo;subdivision&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The ultimate objective is to &ldquo;evenly develop&rdquo; as many of these sites as possible, without going broke !&#10;&#10;The Residential zone can be developed by building Cottages, Mansions, and Flats(apartments), while the Industrial zone is available for a variety of uses, represented by card &ldquo;shares&rdquo;( stocks). It is NOT necessary to land on a particular site to purchase it.&#10;&#10;Players alternate between each ring according to dice throws, and pay penalties for landing on other Players&rsquo; sites. Several spaces mandate change of zone. Movement is subject to considerable randomization.&#10;&#10;Each player receives an initial land allocation of two &ldquo;subdivisions&rsquo; (two sites each of Residential and Industrial) ; plus a cash &ldquo;float&rdquo;. Players proceed to buy development items, initially from the bank. The pool of available items is limited, to induce competition.&#10;&#10;The inventory comprises: Cottages 14, Mansions 10, Flats 6 ( total 30). The space available to place these items totals 24. Prices range from a low of $100 for &ldquo;Cottages&rdquo; to $400 for a &ldquo;share&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Electronics&rdquo; factory. More expensive items eventually provide a disproportionately higher return, but may be too expensive in the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Players are able to increase the value of their holdings by increasing the capital investment on each site from a single unit up to two units and/or more valuable buildings and upgraded shares. Any site must contain only identical items, but any subdivision may contain a mix ( eg cottages and mansions on adjacent sites; or, say, &ldquo;railway&rdquo; shares next to &ldquo;glass works&rdquo;).Various bonuses accrue when sites are &ldquo;double developed&rdquo; and/or when sites are &ldquo;evenly developed&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;These development items are available initially from a bank, but soon become tradeable between Players. Players short of cash for Landing fees may even have to trade/sell at &ldquo;distress&rdquo; prices.&#10;&#10;When all a Player&rsquo;s sites are &ldquo;evenly developed&rdquo;, Players can attempt to buy more &#10;(vacant) land, from the bank only.&#10;&#10;The game has several unusual features:&#10;1. &ldquo;stock&rsquo; ( houses, shares etc) can be moved from one site to another, or even &ldquo;off board&rdquo; until required again.&#10;2. un-developed sites attract no landing fees (unlike Monopoly)&#10;3. there is some limited scope for trading of rationed items above their &ldquo;bank price&rdquo;, as Players seek to establish &ldquo;double developed&rdquo; sites&#10;4. The amount of cash available to any Player for buying at any one time is limited by certain arbitrary rules.&#10;&#10;Possible faults :&#10;1. The supply of in-coming cash seems too small compared to the amount leaving the Game via random penalties.&#10;2. Arbitrary limits on Players ability to spend seem unnecessary.&#10;3. The Game relies on a &ldquo;Special Lucky Seven&rdquo; rule that is easy to overlook ! &#10;4. The Rules are numbered, thus easy to reference; they are not however, arranged intuitively, and contain a few cryptic passages!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Embargo is an abstract strategy game for 2 or 4 players. You begin the game with your six pieces arranged in a triangle on one corner of a chess board. Pieces rest on the points of the grid, not the spaces.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can move one of your pieces any distance in a horizontal or vertical direction, like a rook in chess. Your goal is to move all of your pieces to the opposite corner of the board.&#10;&#10;When two pieces of the same color share the same line without any other colored pieces between them, imagine an invisible wall extending between those two pieces. You cannot move your piece through any wall nor can you land a piece on a point currently occupied by a wall. (This rule applies even if you're trying to pass through a wall you created!)&#10;&#10;Because walls apply equally to all players, it becomes dangerous to be too defensive. A diplomatic atmosphere emerges from these simple mechanics as your pieces dance around the board, avoiding walls and building new walls of their own.&#10;&#10;From the Luchacabra website:&#10;&#10;This elegant abstract board game is deceptively simple. Move your pieces like chess rooks, trying to get to the opposite corner of the board. Uninterrupted lines between your pieces form imaginary walls that no pieces, not even your own, can cross. That&rsquo;s it! Embargo is a strategic game of territorial control and sharing.&#10;&#10;",

It is a game similar to &quot;Scrabble&quot;, but instead of connecting letters, the player is connecting numbers. This original version of &quot;Tumble Numble&quot; was released by Mag-Nif Inc. in 1966 it contained the dice, and instruction booklet. The box itself acted as a dice shaker. It was republished in 1969 by Selchow &amp; Righter. For this edition, a score card, sand timer, and separate tumbler cup were also included. Selchow &amp; Righter rereleased the original boardgame version of &quot;Numble&quot; in 1968, while their &quot;Tumble Numble&quot; version is called a &quot;Portable Cube Edition&quot;.&#10;&#10;{Dice included.}&#10;Red numbers on cube, with (gold numbers): 1, 2, (3), 4, (5), 7&#10;Blue numbers on cube: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8&#10;Green numbers cube: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9&#10;{8 cubes with Black numbers;}&#10;{Blank side}, 0, 1, 7, 8, 9&#10;0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9&#10;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#10;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#10;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#10;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#10;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#10;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#10;&#10;&quot;THE OBJECT:&#10;To compete for high score while placing numbered cubes in sequences that are divisible by three.&#10;&#10;TO BEGIN:&#10;Each player tumbles a cube.&#10;The player with the highest value starts.&#10;To start each round: place all eleven cubes in the Tumble Numble Tumbler,&#10;the first player then tumbles five cubes into his hand (without looking at their values)&#10;and passes these five cubes to the player on his left.&#10;This occurs only at the beginning of each Round.&#10;The remaining six cubes he tumbles upon the table and arranges as many as possible in a valid sequence.&#10;After declaring the score, he passes the tumbler along with any cubes he was unable to use, to the player on his left.&#10;The second player places his five cubes along with any unused cubes from the preceding player into the tumbler,&#10;tumbles them upon the table and arranges his cubes as an extension or in cross-word fashion to the previously&#10;played sequence.&#10;&#10;BASIC STRATEGY&#10;Create sequences that take best advantage of Bonus Cubes, particularly the double and triple sequence cube&#10;so that the cube will be available to either you or your partner on succeeding plays.&#10;Avoid making bonus cubes available to opponents.&#10;Remember the Zero Cube freezes further play and is of considerable strategic value in this respect.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;An Exciting Way to Discover Black Heritage!&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a well-produced game that tests the players' knowledge of famous black people, black history, and black culture, with a predominantly American focus.  The primary goal of the game is to score points by answering questions on the above subjects, with individual turn actions keyed by a basic roll-and-move mechanic.&#10;&#10;The significant twist in the game is that each player takes one of twenty cards sets, each set consisting of 11 cards.  Ten are clue cards related to a single black historical figure or celebrity.  Another card in each set has the person's name and picture.  During the game, the other players have the opportunity privately or publicly hear the clues and try to guess the character.  The clues are divulged based on the players answers to toss-up questions on cards (&quot;Words of Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Go Back to your Roots&quot;), drawn when they land on the corresponding squares.  Other squares allow free guessing of secret identities, answering questions for additional points, and other more typical roll-and-move actions.  Points for answers/guesses are tallied on paper for as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;This game appears to have a good balance between movement, deduction, and trivia mechanics.  An unfortunate rule is that players who have their secret identities guessed are then out of the game, so it would help to have the most obscure figure possible. (There were two of twenty I was completely unfamiliar with, and a couple more I needed a clue to recognize.)&#10;&#10;There will not be much replay after all the IDs have been used...but if that happens the game will have largely succeeded in it primary educational goal.&#10;&#10;",
