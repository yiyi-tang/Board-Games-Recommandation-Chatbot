    "Description": "Tales of War is a competitive tactical board game for two players, which places you in the roles of army generals in the conflict for the Cross of Eternity, an ancient artefact holding the key to immortality!&#10;&#10;The game board represents an open book filled with ever-changing terrain and mighty heroes leading their armies of medieval troops and fantasy creatures into battle. Each time you play the game, you write a new tale. It is your very own tale of war!&#10;&#10;Key gameplay features:&#10;&#10;- Skill-based combat. Players take turns activating one unit at a time and either move it to another position or attack an opponent&acute;s unit. Tales of War doesn&rsquo;t use dice, nor cards to resolve combat. Instead defeating enemy units is as simple as either moving your melee unit onto a square occupied by them or positioning your ranged units in the line of fire and range.&#10;&#10;Each unit has different equipment, which defines its special rules. For example, units equipped with spears will automatically repel a direct cavalry charge and archers cannot make a frontal assault on units armed with shields. A player can still use the cavalry to outmanoeuvre a unit equipped with spears and devastate it with a flank or rear charge, just as archers may trap a shielded enemy by attacking at an angle.&#10;&#10;There are 21 unit types and each has unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses. As the campaign progresses, your initially small force expands to include units, such as Elves, Dwarves, Fire and Ice Sorceresses, Giants, Hydras, Fire Elementals or even Vampires!&#10;&#10;- RPG-like sense of progression and a constant arms race. Both armies evolve from one battle to the next, and your heroes learn new skills making them more dangerous on the battlefield;&#10;&#10;- Replayability. Tales of War offers new, unique challenges and strategic/tactical possibilities each time you play. Each battle has its own victory conditions and is played on unique terrain. You will face a different, custom-built army each battle, just as your own army will have been re-equipped and re-organised.&#10;&#10;- Fast setup and quick turns. Tales of War takes under 5 minutes to set up and tear down. Watching your opponents moves is as exciting as making your own as it always has an impact on the situation on the board;&#10;&#10;- Ease of saving campaign progress. Simply put your units and their cards into your army box and that's it. You can pick up where you left off in the next session.&#10;&#10;",

Once an obstacle has been revealed, other drivers can use that knowledge to their advantage when planning their own routes.&#10;&#10;To win the race, you must be the first to run a full lap through the world and a final reverse lap.

We meet the 'Strong', the 'Fitness Fanatic', the 'Sadist', and many others.&#10;&#10;There are game variations on classic card games.&#10;&#10;1) &quot;Classical&ldquo; Quartet: players try to make pairs (e.g.cards 1A and 1B are a pair, 1C and 1D another), by asking one of the other players if they have the card they need.&#10;&#10;2) Piranhas: similar to 1, but the Piranhas card does not have a 'partner'. the player stuck with the Piranhas card at the end has to do a fine (e.g. 10 push-ups)&#10;&#10;3) Quartet variation &lsquo;Trumps&rsquo;: Here the categories come into play. one player choses for example 'Pain Tolerance' and then all players have to say the value of their card. The highest (or lowest) value wins over the others.&#10;&#10;4) As 3 but with a dice: after the active player has announced the category, anyone can throw the dice (he/she has to pay 1 card to do this though). depending on the number he/she can e.g. change the category, take a card from somebody else, the value is doubled, etc.&#10;&#10;5)The 'Randori' Cards (5 different ones). These cards can be used at the end of a game round (played as in 3): As soon as it is clear who has actually won this round, another player can put down a Randori card to challenge the round winner. The first player to lay a Randori card is the challenger for this round. Each round can also end without a Randori card being played. Challenges are e.g. reaction (who grabs the dice first on a sign of a third player), Mushin: try to lure the round winner from the state of 'empty mind': with grimaces, jokes, and sounds trying to make him/her laugh.&#10;&#10;",

But the rural tranquility is shattered when celebrity chef Francis &quot;Franny&quot; Craddock is found dead, late Saturday night. Particularly when it turns out that he's been murdered.

Everyone is a suspect when murder's on the menu. Here's everything you need to serve up mystery, murder, and fun - party planner, invitations, recipes - plus a tasty murder to solve.

Le joueur doit utiliser la formule magique &ldquo;Kiddi&rdquo; pour faire son lien et l&rsquo;expliquer. Les autres joueurs jugent si&#10;ce lien est acceptable ou non.  En cours de partie, des cartes cataclysmes viennent dynamiser le jeu.&#10;&#10;En plus de d&eacute;velopper l&rsquo;habilet&eacute; &agrave; faire des liens, plusieurs apprentissages au niveau langagier sont d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s avec Kiddi: prendre la parole, organiser son discours et stimuler la pr&eacute;-lecture.&#10;&#10;",

In this upper third there is a map of Czechoslovakia with marked large cities. The lower two thirds of the game board slope and contain the same list of cities, but it is spread over the game board. Each city is represented by a hole in the game board.&#10;&#10;Basic style of play:&#10;The task is to collect as many kilometres as possible between the start and finish city.&#10;&#10;Rules and course of the game:&#10;At the beginning, the players draw for the order (the order has no effect on the course of the game).&#10;The first player then takes a cricket (a wooden rotating figure) - then he chooses the starting city on the map (in the upper third of the game board) and in this city he spins the crickets with his fingers. Due to the curvature of the board, the spinning cricket gradually descends down the board - the task is to fit into a hole that represents the city as far away from the player's starting city as possible.&#10;If the spinning cricket does not fit into any hole in the city, the player gets 0 points. When it fits into a hole representing a city, the player looks at the attached table of distances between cities and compares his selected start city and finish (where the spinning cricket reached) and the number of kilometres is his score.&#10;Then another player plays.&#10;The player who collects the most kilometres wins. The number of rounds and the number of players is not theoretically limited.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Startropolis: Second Edition is a family friendly, modular 3-D space station building game where you not only get to build a space station in 3D, but try and earn the most money. Each turn, players buy modules and connect them to the existing space station. This creates revenue, and allows them to purchase more modules. The player with the most credits at game end wins.&#10;&#10;The main rule changes from the first edition are that the end game now has a second income phase to make purchases in the final rounds more compelling. The module track rules changed to have players discard and redraw a new module if 3 duplicates are already in there. The module decks and factions had some clarifications and errata applied to them to help clear some things up.&#10;&#10;You are the alien CEO of a galactic corporation and your masters have given you seed money to invest in the new joint space station. What will you purchase? A solar power monopoly? Luxury habitats? Will you outperform your competition, and prove your dominance?&#10;&#10;This second edition of Startropolis includes all new art from Brian Patterson.&#10;&#10;",

Viuda (which means &ldquo;Widow&rdquo; in Spanish) has it roots in the older game of Whiskey Poker, which in turn took ideas from the much older game of Widow Whist; in Widow Whist, an extra hand is dealt to the center of the table (the widow), which players can then use in addition to their own hand. Calaveras takes the general game-play ideas from Viuda, but adds an extra suit and some special cards that make the game much more strategic and appealing  to the sensibilities of modern gamers.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 5 cards in their hand. 5 cards are also dealt to the center of the table. Before the round begins, in turn order, each player can swap their hand with the cards on the table, turning their cards face up. Once the center cards are revealed, each player in turn order can swap one card from their hand with a card on the table, swap their entire hand with all the cards on the table, or pass. This continues until a player knocks, indicating they want the round to end. After knocking, every other player (except the knocker) gets one last turn, then hands are revealed; the lowest hand then loses one of the three skulls they started the game with (the hands are ranked similar to poker, but with 5 suits rather than 4)&#10;  &#10;The goal of Calaveras is to be the last player in the game. Each player starts the game with three skull tokens. After each round of play, the player with the lowest hand loses one of his skulls; when a player loses his last skull, he is out of the game. The winner is the last player to still have skulls after everyone has lost theirs.&#10;&#10;",

The game is themed around visiting the graves of your departed family members through a trick-taking mechanic.&#10;&#10;The suits in the game correspond to your different family members (e.g. Grandpa, Aunt, &quot;That Uncle&quot;), and each is worth a different number of points.  At the start of a hand, players choose one card from their hand to bid with.&#10;&#10;During the game play, tricks can have 1 or 2 winners. The first winner of the trick is the person who played the highest card of the lead suit or the trump suit (monks).  That player takes each of those cards, and sets them in a pile next to their bid card, with a specified card on top.  If any players visited the grave adjacent to the lead suit, that suit can also have a winner, and that person makes a similar stack.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, a player has met their bid if in the piles they've created next to it from winning tricks, they are showing another card of the bid suit, and the points for the visible cards sum to exactly the rank of the bid card.  The player who met their bid and scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The game includes several &quot;advanced&quot; modules, such as special powers; a tie-break card; and a story-telling aspect where the winner of a trick is encouraged to share a memory of a family member of the lead suit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mission Pawssible! is a 2-5 player card game, made in India and product of India. Each player plays the role of a volunteer at an animal shelter. It's a mad scramble between them as their mission is to earn points by taking care of the kennel animals and getting them adopted!&#10;&#10;Players begin with 2 kennel cards with their respective kennel animals. They must collect the task cards from various decks and place on their kennel cards to make as many sets as possible.&#10;&#10;A family card needs to be put on top of a kennel card when a player wants to complete an adoption! With a complete adoption, player moves on to another kennel card till all (3-4) are adopted and then the scoring round begins.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest points wins.&#10;&#10;This is a quick and highly engrossing game as everyone has their eyes on completing their own sets of points and kennel-animal adoptions! It's fairly easy to understand for all ages and is a good fit for teens, adults, kids, friends/family. The game contains 120 cards and a rule booklet.&#10;&#10;We have collaborated with 4 NGOs across India that do tremendous amount of work for the different causes associated with animal welfare - World For All (WFA, Mumbai), The Welfare of Stray Dogs (WSD, Mumbai), People For Animals (PFA, across multiple states), and Charlies Animal Rescue Centre (CARE, Bangalore). A part of the sales proceeds from this game will be donated to these organisations. We have featured a few of the dogs and cats from these NGOs. These and many more are still looking for a forever home!&#10;&#10;",

Numerous ecological disasters and incessant wars have caused it to regress to almost prehistoric levels. Nature has reclaimed its rights, invading the former world, the remains of which are barely visible under the luxuriant vegetation. Yet, little by little, a new civilization is emerging. And it is sending explorers to the ruins of the old world to try to discover its secrets. One of these cities, which was once Venice, is the focus of much interest. For a long time, it was inaccessible, almost entirely submerged under waters teeming with predators. But a few months ago, the sea level began to drop, revealing an ancient city just waiting to be explored. Several tribes have sent their best trackers to follow rumors of a mythical treasure and numerous artifacts from the past. But the city holds many threats, including a mysterious half-man, half-machine guardian known as the Doge.&#10;&#10;In The Last Doge, you play as the champion of one of six tribes living on the outskirts of the city, each with a good reason for wanting to explore the city and find the treasure, the nature of which changes according to their legends. This will not be easy, but you can also be satisfied with bringing back artifacts from ancient times, or simply getting in the way of the other champions...or at least escape with your life !&#10;&#10;To win, you must be the player with the most trophies at the end of the game but also survive long enough to escape the wrath of the city's dreadful guardian.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flanks of Gettysburg is a two, two-player games on a company level, simulating the two brigade sized flank attacks on Little Round Top and Culp&rsquo;s Hill on July 2, 1863.  Each assault is a separate game based on a chit-pull system that can be completed in several hours.  Historically the Union bested rebel forces on both flanks because it fed enough reinforcements in to stem the gray tide But that is not to say that the rebels don&rsquo;t stand a chance. They do.&#10;&#10;FOG uses a chit pull system similar to John Poniske&rsquo;s Ball&rsquo; Bluff and Belmont designs.  Both games follow similar rules applying unique fire and movement, melee and order assignment. These are simple, rapid playing approaches to complex situations.  FOG clocks in at three to three and a half hours per game and provides high solitaire capability.&#10;&#10;The battles of Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Little Roundtop demonstrated Lee&rsquo;s determination to attack and envelop the Union Army of the Potomac. FOG does not attempt to recreate either grand assault in full, rather it presents the desperate three-hour finale that took place on the extreme ends in both cases These were the two instances when Lee came closest to claiming a Gettysburg breakthrough. &#10;Culp&rsquo;s Hill offers the Union prepared defensive positions but the liability of having reinforcements report to General Greene before joining the line. Little Round Top introduces artillery and sharpshooters and challenges players to exit or block the exit of Rebel forces between Little and Big Round Tops.&#10;&#10;Each game offers a beautiful Rick Barber map and a low counter mix. Regimental draw chits allow companies to move, volley fire or melee at the player&rsquo;s discretion. The ground over which the Confederates must assault is rough and at times movement under fire can be distressingly slow. Casualties mount rapidly until the rebels are close enough to exact revenge.&#10;&#10;&ndash;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;From the Rules: About 30 yards/hex; 30 minutes/turn; units are companies of ca. 40-50 men.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The East Germans were well prepared to attack and conquer West Berlin. Every step of the process was thoroughly planned. The Battle was to take no more than three days. From the crack Friedrich Engels Guard Regiment to the 1st Motorized Rifle Division &ndash; as well as paramilitary forces of the Socialist Unity Party, East Germany was ready. The Soviets had their own elite force of the 6th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade in East Berlin, ready to join the fight. And, if anything went astray in the plans, the massive 35th Motorized Rifle Division was 10 miles away to the west and available to intervene if needed. The Warsaw Pact forces massively outnumbered the isolated NATO forces.&#10;&#10;But NATO was not ill prepared for what might come. The well-equipped and famous &ldquo;Berlin Brigade&rdquo; of the US Army, The Berlin Infantry Brigade of the UK, and The Forces Fran&ccedil;aises &agrave; Berlin from the French Army. Three strong brigades fully armed with tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and artillery. In addition, the numerous, if less well equipped, West German Police forces were to stand with their NATO Allies. It would perhaps be a stiffer fight than the East German planners were envisioning. The Stage was set.&#10;&#10;The Enemy is at the Gates is the second installment of the Modern War series using the well-regarded Company Scale System. Players will fight this might-have-been battle using mostly companies at 500 meters a hex scale. Each turn is 2 hours, and the game uses a &ldquo;chit-pull&rdquo; system that makes for both unpredictable face-to-face play as well as an excellent solitaire experience. The maps are painstakingly and meticulously drawn by Antonio Pinar providing perhaps the best major urban map ever made. Greg Sarnecki is also on board to provide the most exacting order of battle also ever made for this campaign. This is the ultimate game of modern urban warfare on a massive scale. As befits a game on modern war, air power, helicopters, electronic warfare, chemical weapons, and sabotage will be included as well.

    "Description": "Mark of the Muse is a new card game, designed with the idea of community in mind. This system allows for artists to submit their art for a team of game designers to turn their work into a playable card. It&rsquo;s meant to be fun for collectors, and a recognition opportunity for artists. Cards are of course completely playable as a game, encouraging collectors to seek out and browse artists for new cards, and aid artists by both getting their names out there and being another source of income.&#10;&#10;The cards are designed to maximize the original artwork while being easy to understand and see all the necessary stats and abilities. We decided to not use any borders on the edge in order to see as much of the art as possible.&#10;&#10;On a turn,  players draw a card then play cards to attack their opponent. When a player has defeated 10 cards the player wins.&#10;&#10;Certain cards have a life point on them, with only a specific amount being playable each turn. If these cards' HP get reduced to zero that card goes to the Lifeline. Cards on the Lifeline may still be used as resources, fueling other cards' abilities when flipped. When the Lifeline contains 10 cards, that player is out and the remaining player wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Ideal for the curious who wish to discover or rediscover History in all or simply or the amateurs who want to consolidate their knowledge.&#10;&#10;Chroni is a card game where each card depicts a historical event, invention or discovery on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred, invention or discovery was made on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "2122. The Earth has fallen. In the hope of survival, humanity has moved to a massive space station built by artificial intelligence. However, the machines have already become self-conscious during construction, and once the passengers have entered the cryo phase, they have been exiled to a virtual world, RealLife-8, where all our activities generate energy for them, drifting in space towards a new planet rich in ores for the machines. Now we approached a promising planet, and they no longer need us. Their agents must perform the final touches before the servers shut down. If their goal succeeds, our lives are over.&#10;&#10;A small team aboard the ARCHimedes is already aware of what the machines are planning. Their purpose is variable. Most of the team is working to prevent server downtime long enough while breaking the path to the source. One of them is the chosen one who, when he gets into the source, rewrites the code of the machines and frees humanity. However, a member of the team does not want liberation. He wants to maintain this virtual world and reprogram it into the DreamLife version. He made a deal with the machines. If they win with his help, a small portion of the people, including him, will be moved to DreamLife&rsquo;s servers. Will we be able to keep humanity alive?&#10;&#10;In this Matrix- and Cyberpunk-inspired world, 1-6 players in semi-cooperative or cooperative game modes struggle to defeat agents, obtain access codes, and get into the SOURCE. Variable player powers, deckbuilding, hybrid gaming experience with exciting votes and with a special upgrading system.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you play your 4 cards. With these, you can move on your ship and in the city, explore new locations, repair, free up civilians, attack agents and upgrade your deck. Your actions generate energy for the machines. At the end of your turn, draw a new hand (4 cards), roll two dice, choose one, and the effect will be on the agents.&#10;&#10;If you complete all three quests and then finally the chosen one enters the Source, the liberators win. If too many locations become infected, if there are too many agents in the city, if there is too much damage on the spaceship, if the traitor enters the source, the traitor and the machines win. If any of these are met, the game ends immediately.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to reduce the value of the cards in your hand to less than 7 points by clever discarding. Once this is achieved, that player can shout GL&Uuml;CKSGRIFF and the round is completed. The player who now has the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Then, six months before the outbreak of the war, Station 37 went dark. No escape pods were launched and all attempts at communication went unanswered. Only a solitary, repeating broadcast filled the silence: &quot;This station is under quarantine - do not approach&rdquo;. When the war came, the station was forgotten, left to drift lifelessly in its empty system. Now, in the aftermath of the Last War, Station 37 has been rediscovered and its broadcast heard once more.&#10;&#10;Quarantine 37 is a supplement for Stargrave in which players lead their crews into an abandoned space station, hunting for lost technology, unique research, and forgotten experiments.

The contents include a scorepad, instructions sheet, 4 golf course boards with 4 or 5 holes on each one (18 total holes), one D6 die with letters A to F on it (representing which track your ball follows down a golf hole green), 17 different D6 dice representing various golf clubs and distances hit, and 8 player markers (2 each in 4 colors).&#10;&#10;Each player rolls the letter die to determine which of the 6 tracks they will follow on the first hole. Then take turns choosing an appropriate golf club die (woods, drivers, etc), each with different possible distances on the six sides, to roll to proceed down the course. There are sand/water traps along the way that your ball can either fly over (if you roll a long enough distance) or land in, which requires you to switch to a different die such as a sand wedge with shorter potential distances on it. Once you reach the putting green near the end of a hole, you switch to a putter die that tells you how many putts it took you to get the ball in that hole. Add up the total of each player's strokes/putts on that hole, and record it on the scoresheet. Then continue on the next hole. Just like in real golf, the player with the lowest score after either 9 or all 18 holes is the winner; or if only 1 player is playing, compete against the provided par numbers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

(Roman Association of Operative Games) and then, in the '70s, it was slowly presented, piece by piece, on the defense magazine Esercito e Armi - Interconair. At last it was published as a book by the Italian editor Mursia that had a series of book dedicated to adult gaming.&#10;The game reproduces, at operational level, the clashes for the control of a sea zone.

The strongest representatives of each generation participate in a galactic tournament once a year called the Elementa Arcanum -- a spectacle so mesmerizing it surpassed the Olympics and rendered it obsolete.  As the years pass, the most talented of each generation slowly begin to emerge until a victor is declared.  The winner is named the Elementa Prima and dons the Black Hole Robes, forever etched into history.  Will you wield Ultima and master the 4 Elements?&#10;&#10;Elementa Arcanum is a deck-building card game for 1-6+ players.  Players alternate between Combat Turns, where they vie for Stars (Victory Points) and Research Turns where players can improve and optimize their decks.  The first player to 5 Stars wins the game.  The rules are relatively simple and can be taught to newcomers while the game is underway through the &quot;Teaching Game&quot; system.  The game has a very small form-factor and is highly portable.  A common shop containing new cards for players to acquire uses a tiered system and uses rules to prevent shop stagnation.&#10;&#10;",
