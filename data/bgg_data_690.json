    "Description": "A card game of commanding armies.  Players take turns in this game building armies to smite their foes.&#10;&#10;Each player shuffles their own deck, and draws 5 cards, along with some resource markers, to begin the game.  On each player's turn, the following phases are worked through:&#10;&#10;Ready Phase: the player either draws a card from their deck into their hand, or gains one gold, and all expended cards are readied (untapped, ala Magic: The Gathering).&#10;&#10;Production and Upkeep Phase: All cards that may produce resources may do so now.  If they do, they are expended (turned face down).  After resources have been collected, minion's salaries must be paid from the player's resource pool.  Any minion whose salary isn't paid is discarded from play.&#10;&#10;Main Phase: Use resources to buy more minions and resource producers.&#10;&#10;Attack Phase: Declare attacks against the other player with your minions.  The defending player determines which of their minions block.  Any unblocked minions deal damage to the defending player's health.  When a player's health is reduced to zero that player loses the game.&#10;&#10;End Phase: Discard down to 5 cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The goal is to reduce the opponent's health to zero while preventing yours from receiving fatal damage.  To do this, a clever combination of resource management and strategy in attack is required.&#10;&#10;",

The point of the game is to build the most (and longest) finished castles by the end of the game. Castle tokens are won from successful sieges of different castles throughout the game, as the king travels across the country evaluating the knights' skills. Whoever wins shall be king!&#10;&#10;The game includes a large board with four cardboard castles (square spaces closed off with walls) with turrets, upon which ladders with differing numbers of knights are hung. The king moves on a track in the middle of the board. Different spaces on the track may indicate different castles upon which sieges will be scored. In order to score for a siege, a player must have the appropriate amount of knight tokens on the spaces under the castle walls, as well as ladders with knights. To place a ladder or token (or draw an 'intrigue' card), dice are rolled by the leading player in that turn, and each player takes off a die and resolves the appropriate action.&#10;&#10;",

In it, you have 3 different colored pieces that can stack on each other, each a different color.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player moves the top piece on one of the spaces onto the board to another space, and scores points for that color.  Players must either move a piece from, or a piece to, a space which didn't either have a piece from it or to it the last turn (after the first turn this is true.  The first turn a piece may move to any empty space).&#10;&#10;When a piece of a given color moves onto a space, its color scores 1 point for the number of pieces currently on that space (after landing on it).&#10;&#10;Each player has one of the colors as their color.  The object of the game is for a player to have their color have the lowest score after any of the colors reached the target score selected at the start of the game (20-30 points is usually an ideal target score for a quick game).&#10;&#10;While not initially intended, this game is now part of a planned series of games played on a single line, that will contain at least 3 games.  Two more are in the works.  This may change, but this is the plan of this moment.  Keep an eye out for a Geeklist containing the games in this planned series.&#10;&#10;",

The design is what was originally intended but deviated from with the introduction of chess pieces in Linebreakers.&#10;&#10;Traplines, like Linebreakers, utilizes custodial trapping and delayed capture.  In this, two pieces of a player will &quot;bookend&quot; a line of enemy pieces and freeze them so they can't move, but can be captured in a future turn.  The origins of the idea came from pondering what would happen if you took Othello/Reversi and moved pieces on the board.  From this the custodial trap, with delayed capture, move came about.&#10;&#10;In the game, there are a number of starting configurations and multiple variants that involve capturing opponent's pieces or exiting one's own pieces off the board, in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players could use the device during syndicated episodes from August 31, 1988 through &quot;at least&quot; September 1, 1990 to read puzzles directly from the television screen.&#10;&#10;The device can be used to play using either of the two VHS tapes available. Point the device at the television set while the VHS tape is playing and the device will be programmed with a puzzle. Puzzles can also be programmed manually using the keyboard.&#10;&#10;Up to three players can play the standard game that is based on the television series. There is also a &quot;Jackpot&quot; version for an unlimited number of players where the puzzle solver gets a jackpot that starts at $1,000 but is reduced $100 for every letter guessed. In either version, the winner is the person who has the most money after a predetermined number of puzzles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ocho is sorta like Gin Rummy with power cards, although it has mechanics that we have never encountered before.  It is ideal for two players, two teams of two, or large multiplayer games.  You collect pairs.  You need to play your pairs in order from Ones to Eights.  You can SEE an opponent's hand, GET a card from their hand, DIG in the discard pile, or destroy their highest pair with a POW!  You can also negate any power card with NOT.&#10;&#10;One of the key mechanics is the hand size requirement.  You must always have exactly six cards in hand before playing anything on the board.  Each player starts with six cards.  You draw one card to start your turn, then discard one card to return your hand size to six.&#10;&#10;Ocho The Game is incredibly balanced.  As a competitive game it rivals Poker and Rummy.  We are launching it on Kickstarter currently, and we hope to run World Championships at GenCon 2012.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Murder! Mystery! Mastermind! (M3) is a modern brain-twisting take on crime solving and the deduction boardgame genre. The game is divided into two phases: the Investigative Phase and the Trial Phase.&#10;&#10;In the Investigative Phase, players scour the city as the Detective, Police, CSI or the Widow to find the evidence, motive and witness of the crime. Once these are pieced together, the clues will point to the location(s), where the crime was actually committed. In this phase, you will feel the drama and suspense of a crime-solving novel or TV drama series, where each clue that the players reveal will lead to more clues and a deeper understanding of the murder. Players can also learn clues from each other privately while using their unique occupational powers to the fullest.&#10;&#10;To make matters even more intriguing, you suspect that one of the players is actually the Mastermind behind the murder. It's a mad rush to the murder trial, and the Mastermind is doing his or her best to confound the investigations, with an ability to lie.&#10;&#10;The fifth player will play the reporter &ndash; and true to form of the unrelenting paparazzi &ndash; will ambush players at locations to query them or shadow players and learn what they learn. Their objective? Get the expos&eacute; before the trial even commences.&#10;&#10;At the trial, players will start presenting their accusations in court on what the murder evidence, motive, and witness are and where the crime was committed as well as the mastermind behind the murder. The trial will gradually build up to a scintillating climax where the player who has placed the most correct accusation tokens wins. However, if not enough of the case has been built up, the Mastermind will walk free. Will justice ultimately prevail? It's all in your hands &ndash; or brain.&#10;&#10;",

When an Ukri dies, he or she must battle his or her way through a series of seven Soul Gates, also known as the Enki-Des. Each Enki-Des has a unique guardian that must be defeated. The guardian of the seventh Enki-Des, Enko-Rochimga, cannot be defeated in physical combat. Instead, the Ukri must present his or her Enko-ori, or essence pearl, to prove him- or herself worthy of entering Furrma, or paradise.&#10;&#10;In Enki-Des, you play a young Ukri warrior who dies on the battlefield.  You find yourself at the first Soul Gate and must fight the first six different guardians while searching for your Enko-ori in order to reach Enko-Rochimga and win the game.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a 6x6 &quot;action chart&quot; and a dice-rolling mechanic to determine your action each turn.  You roll three dice, then select two of them and use them to select an action from the action chart.  Alternatively, you can select just one die and lock it into place for use next turn.  Choose your action carefully, though; the guardian will not let up attacking until you are dead.  And don't forget to search for your Enko-ori!  You'll need it to win the game!&#10;&#10;",

These positions influence where they can hope to win votes. The more right-wing they are, for example, the easier it will be to rally voters in the South and Frontier states; if they choose a centrist platform, the more likely that Swing State voters are to join the cause.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose whether to campaign, claiming votes ahead of the election; strategize, directing the flow of the contest in their favor; or advertise, swaying voters with a carefully crafted message. And no two games will likely be the same, as cards-in-hand suggest paths to follow and the constantly changing News Cycle shines a fickle light on one of fifteen possible issue positions, meaning that timing and clever play are everything.&#10;&#10;The game simulates the modern American presidential campaign, with a home-stretch, flip-flops (and resulting attack ads), gaffes during debates, red-meat speeches, polling, &quot;fire-in-the-belly&quot;, &quot;robo calls&quot; and much more.  All cards appear in both the Democratic and Republican player's deck, the two sides are evenly balanced, and the electoral map is tuned to the latest census numbers that will be in place for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 elections.&#10;&#10;",

Instead of simply fighting the undead, you must also manage your limited resources and choose when to call for reinforcements, when to focus on building the wall, and when to develop new tactics for this completely unforeseen enemy.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to create a &quot;salsa bowl&quot; by playing two or more cards from your hand that collectively match the &quot;heat&quot; of the current order, plus or minus five degrees. The target is determined with a spinner marked in increments from 10 to 100.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you draw a card, then either use a special action card, discard a card, or try to make salsa by playing cards from your hand. When you make salsa, other players can trump your salsa by playing a &quot;salsa bowl&quot; with the correct value and at least one card more than you played. Whoever plays the best (i.e. largest) salsa claims all the cards played.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, players have one more chance to make salsa, then the game ends.

Players alternate placing tokens on a 4 x 4 grid (with an extra space in the bottom left).  Tokens must be placed in a proscribed order (red then white then blue).  The player who is forced to complete a set of three colours anywhere in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line is the loser.&#10;&#10;In The Great Quarter Century Race Game, 2-3 players bluff and guess their way through the 25 spaces on the board.  One player will hide a token in a hand and present both hands to the active player, who will select one.  If the hand without the token is chosen, the active player advances on the track, otherwise it is the next player's turn.  Some spaces will cause the token to advance further, and landing on a space occupied by another token will send that token backward on the track.  The first to reach the middle square is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It contains 35 scenarios set in the Normandy countryside: 20 of them from the long-out-of-print boxed game, 14 new ones by Mike Perryman, and one mega-scenario by Patrick Callahan. Plus the usual background material.&#10;&#10;Airborne includes a mapboard, but no playing pieces. Players will need playing pieces and some maps from Elsenborn Ridge and Battle of the Bulge; a few scenarios also use boards or pieces from 1940 - The Fall of France and Edelweiss.&#10;&#10;Airborne is sold in both print and digital editions. The digital edition does not include a map&#10;&#10;",

Each player has different locations to visit, but they share vehicles &ndash; and going faster won't necessarily be better. By answering questions about the geography of Germany, players can earn extra points.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board that shows a map of Germany, with several cities connected by roads. At the beginning of the game, each player receives six destination cards. Two car pawns are placed at the start location at the center of the board.&#10;&#10;Now, the players take turns moving one of the cars one space along one of the roads. If a player moves a car onto a city, a player who has the matching destination card may play it. If the destination card is played, the player whose turn it is gets to answer a question asked by the tiptoi pen. If he answers correctly, he gains one point; if he answers incorrectly, his left neighbor gets a chance to answer the question correctly for one point.&#10;&#10;Next to cities, a car can also end on an intermediate space, which may have a special meaning:&#10;&#10;    Swift ride: The player gets to take another turn.&#10;    Question: The player gets to answer a question from the tiptoi pen for a point.&#10;    Joker: The player gets to play one of his destination cards, as if the corresponding city has just been visited (which also triggers a question from the pen).&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has played all his destination cards; that player scores one point. A final question follows which allows all players to score additional points. Then, each player adds the number of destination cards played to his points. The player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Table Plain is a coveted trade route once owned by a Merchant Prince, a merchant prince that has been reported dead (though no evidence of his death was ever found). He was loyal to no king and had no heir. Now, eager Kings from adjoining lands battle for control of the Table Plain in hopes that it will bolster their kingdom and further their means. Will you be the victor or will you watch your opponents take control of the land you so covet?&#10;&#10;Token Wars is a 2 player head to head battle of skill and strategy. Each player takes control of an army of tokens that they must strategically push into the battle field (any flat surface with very little resistance). The game is played in four rounds with each player having two turns to defend and two turns to attack. In order to win, one player must either kill the other player's king, take the other player's flag, or capture all three of the other player's chests. If at the end of four rounds there is no victor, the player with the most powerful army wins.&#10;&#10;Whenever your tokens survive a round, they level-up thereby making your army more powerful.&#10;&#10;It is a fun game that is easy to learn but difficult to master.

The two-player team is confronted with two categories and chooses one of them from which to answer a multiple-choice question. The first four questions have four answers, the next three only three answers, and the final question only two answers.&#10;&#10;The guessers must wager all of the money they have on each question, and they can divide their bets on multiple answers if they like &ndash; but one answer must have no money applied toward it. They keep whatever money was bet on the correct answer and lose everything else. If they run out of money before all eight questions, they're out of the game.&#10;&#10;In a two-player game, one player is the quizmaster and the other the guesser. When the round ends, they switch places, and the player who keeps the largest sum of money wins. With more than two players, the player split into multiple teams; each team gives answers for one round, one player from another team is the quizmaster, and everyone else hoots and hollers whenever the first team goofs up and loses money.&#10;&#10;",

Television shows consist of three types of cards: Genres, Gimmicks and Demographics. There are also Wrench cards that can shake up the schedule, shake up hands and keep the game lively and interesting.&#10;&#10;",
