Then each player is dealt a pile of cards, of which they take turns turning one face up. If two players have the same animal in front of them, they must reproduce each other's sound as quickly as possible. Whoever does this the fastest gets the other player's discard pile.&#10;&#10;There are also special cards, which make the game even more difficult. For example, players change identities during the game or they suddenly have to shake hands or hit the table quickly. Whoever has the most cards at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

They are not required to take all of the available discs of that color and may opt to leave one or more behind.&#10;&#10;3) A disc may not be taken if it would divide the remaining discs into two separate groups (counting orthogonal connections only).&#10;&#10;When a player takes discs, they should place them in a row on the table behind the correspondingly colored triangle on the board.&#10;&#10;If a player takes their 5th, 7th, or 9th disc of a color, they should place it on the corresponding circle on their side of the board to make it clear how close they are to reaching one of the three win conditions.&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME&#10;&#10;A player wins the game immediately if they achieve either of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Collect all 9 discs of one color&#10;     Collect at least 7 discs each of three adjacent colors in a row.&#10;&#10;&#10;If neither player is able to accomplish either of these, continue play until all the discs have been taken.

Black Sam took the map with him to his watery grave &ndash; but perhaps the surviving navigator can help to find the treasure by locating the exact position of the islands. Is Antigua one of them?&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Players start with a ship and its crew. Each player during his/er turn uses the actions provided by the crewmen of the ship. Each player may have a maximum of 4 crewmen. Each crewman has an action that may change during the game, thanks to the officer mechanism. A player, by using the officer, may&#10;change the crewmen available actions and thus change the gameplay for all players.&#10;The purpose of the game is to discover islands with treasure (with the help of the crew's Navigator), or while traveling, clash with other players and steal their treasure.&#10;&#10;CREW MEN:&#10;&#10;    Kanonier: one kanonier crewman draws a card from the crew deck and adds its attack to the battle with a +1 bonus. Two kanoniers add +2 bonus&#10;    Offizier: changes the crewmen actions and then is discarded from the ship's crew.&#10;    Navigator: reveals a sea card your ship is on. If it is an island, gain a crew card from the deck for its treasure value and then discard the Navigator.&#10;    Steuermann: one Steuermann moves your ship twice. Two move your ship three times.&#10;    Maat: one Maat hires two new crewmen. Two hires three new crewmen. (if you have more than 4 crewmen, you must discard down to four).&#10;&#10;&#10;GAME END:&#10;The game ends when the biggest part of the sea has been discovered (how big is this part varies, according to the number of players), or when a pre-defined number of battles has happened and the winner is the player with the most treasures.&#10;&#10;",

Each player can first secure four cards, though, so not everything is up for grabs. Players then assemble a robot with a head, body and legs, along with one weapon and any number of bonus cards. Each robot is worth the sum of its parts, along with any applicable bonuses; each additional robot a player can construct is worth ten points, no matter the value of its parts.

    "Description": "The ingenious game of juggling words&#10;&#10;Anagram is a uniquely fast-paced, exciting and challenging game for anyone who loves playing with words.&#10;&#10;Players compete to collect as many words as possible, either by using new letters as they are revealed or by spotting anagrams and poaching their opponents&rsquo; words.&#10;&#10;Play is fast and furious and fortunes can change right up to the end.&#10;&#10;Age 8+&#10;&#10;For 2-8 Players&#10;&#10;Anagram starts with the 90 letter tiles placed face down in easy reach of all players. One after the other, players turn over a tile, taking care that the letter revealed can be seen by all players at the same time. With no waiting as others ponder their moves, as soon as you spot a word that can be made from some or all of the up-turned letters, you may call out that word, pick up the tiles required to spell the word, and arrange the tiles to display the word in front of yourself.&#10;&#10;If you or any player can make an anagram of an entire word belonging to any other player (including yourself), or can make a new word by adding extra letters (from the central pile) to an existing word, you shout out this new word (at any stage in the game) and claim the necessary letters to spell the word. Regardless of how many words you manage to make or steal during the game, you will only score points for those that remain in your possession at the end of play.&#10;&#10;Devised and published by Oxford Games in 1991, and loosely based on the Victorian game of Word Making, Word Taking, Anagram is, without doubt, the word game enthusiast&rsquo;s favourite game.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Anagram is a game for quick and steady thinkers&hellip; This is a cracking little game.&rsquo;  The Play Cabinet&#10;&#10;&lsquo;We have a set of Anagram that has travelled the world with us and everyone who tries it loves it&hellip; Highly recommended.&rsquo; Rivendell&#10;&#10;Product Contents&#10;90x Letter tiles&#10;1x Rules leaflet&#10;&#10;",

This is a card game which matches the left and right of the Chinese character and fish-shellfish pictures.  Randomly disperse the cards on a table face down and turn over two cards.  It is pleasurable to match correctly a fish picture and/or Chinese character in the left corner of the card.  The Sushi corresponds to each of 29 fish-shellfish that are illustrated.  The 29 fish and shellfish chosen are commonly served in Sushi bars.&#10;There are 3 cards in the pack which have no fish or shellfish, but are generally found in Sushi bars.  Card-A : soy sauce dipping dish and its pot.  Card-B : a cup of hot green tea, called &quot;AGARI&quot;, and tea pot.  Card-C : hot Sake bottle &quot;TTOKURI&quot; and tiny cup &quot;CHOKO&quot;.  When playing the game, these cards give you a lucky chance, by way of an extra turn.&#10;The pictures were made by cutting the Japanese gaily-colored pieces of paper, &quot;Chiyogami&quot;.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The team members think up words that fit these constraints as quickly as possible, stopping the sand timer once they've finished.&#10;&#10;Following this, a member of the other team looks at the word list, starts the same sand timer in reverse &mdash; thereby giving him as much time as the team took to write down its words &mdash; then tries to get her teammates to guess these five words.

Lastly, you may add one card face-up to your village (these cards may be used in later rounds) and then draw back up. Alternatively, you may pass on hunting and rest two characters (placing them in your village) and then draw one egg card. Egg cards are gained in many ways, and are used to score end-game bonus points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each area has 7 rows and three columns, showing 1,2, or 3 stones.&#10;&#10;The players try to deduce a set of 3 cards (1 element, 1 row number, 1 number of stones) in play from their own and other players' cards. A player can have a maximum of two cards in their hands, and they have to be different types (e.g., no 2 element cards). On their turn, a player rolls the special dice, showing both a symbol and a number. If the salamander is rolled as the symbol, the player gets to pick up a card. If the stone symbol is rolled, the player &#10;marks one of the possible positions on the board represented by their cards on the board. In any case, the player moves their pawn according to the number rolled.&#10;&#10;If another player reaches a space with another player's marker, they can ask that player for a specific card. The player has to show the questioner a Yes/No card to indicate their answer.&#10;&#10;Once a player knows a set of cards, they move their pawn back to their own starting location. Upon arrival, the player states the set of cards and who has the missing card(s). If the statement is true, the player receives a number of points; if not, they end up in the dungeon. The game ends after a player reaches a certain number of points.&#10;&#10;Der Feuersalamander is the third game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Das Blaue Amulett being the first and second.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "If you know how to play Magic, you are half way there in this blatant Magic clone. What makes this game different is there are two areas to fight/control and the artwork on the cards.&#10;&#10;The story, Heaven has fallen and the Angels trapped on Earth are trying to use the Matrix (internet) to open a gateway into Heaven.&#10;&#10;There are six basic types of cards.&#10;&#10;Locations (lands) that open (tap) to provide aura (mana) or store tau (victory points.) There are 8 different convictions (colors) so from a starter it will still be near impossible to build a deck.&#10;&#10;Characters (creatures) represent the fallen hosts and heathen groups that can be called. These can battle in the Wilds (real world) or plug in and leave their body and fight in the Matrix. While there, if they die they're ripped back into their body.&#10;&#10;Alephs (artifacts) are powerful talismans that attach to characters or locations.&#10;&#10;Enhancements (enchantments) attach to other cards for positive or negative affects.&#10;&#10;Celestial Powers (sorceries) can be played on your turn only and are discarded immediately.&#10;&#10;Miracles (instants) are instant effects that can be played anytime.&#10;&#10;To win the game you need to play cards in the Matrix that can store tau and protect them. Each card can only hold so much, so you will need to call more then one. You will need to store enough tau (5 to 21 depending on the number of players and desired game length) to open a gateway into heaven.&#10;&#10;The game is a bit more complicated than Magic but with fewer cards available not as rich. There is also a social voting element similar to V:tES/Jyhad.  Special mention must be made of the cards. The cards are about an inch longer than most ccgs, with most of the extra room taken up by the stunning artwork. Kudos to Rick Berry, the graphic designer, for making one of the most striking looking games out there.&#10;&#10;",

Wits and planning ability will determine who will be the one to strike the best deal.&#10;&#10;The Angel Investor needs to predict what will happen in the fierce battle of the projects for the market share; only by investing in the projects that will prevail, they can hope to win! Thankfully, they have lots of tools to make even the smallest project flourish and triumph.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the Market Leader starts the game as a winner, as they are ahead of everyone else and all they must do is keep their ground. This is not at all an easy task, and they will have to sabotage many other projects, obstruct other players, and empower/update their own projects in order to stay on top of the game.&#10;&#10;Every game of .disrupt might be different however here are some spotlights that you should expect to happen&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Startupper increasing the design, development, and marketing strength of their project in order to overcome the current Market Leaders project.&#10;&#10;The Market Leader uses their influence to deprive other players of funds and resources so they can continue to monopolize the market.&#10;&#10;The Angel Investor requesting a share of the Project in order to help with its development.&#10;&#10;The Business Process Outsourcer bargains with other players about which project they me help support.&#10;&#10;The Startupper &ldquo;reluctantly&rdquo; sells the shares of a project, they know will not manage to successfully launch.&#10;&#10;The Market Leader buys out a threatening project while selling first the shares of their own project in that market.&#10;&#10;The Angel Investor increases the Social Hype of a project they just bought shares so they can be sold at a higher price.&#10;&#10;The Business Process Outsourcer focusing on a Bear Market first buys shares from all projects in that market, then manipulates the market to switch to Bull Market for maximum gain.&#10;&#10;",

The Axis submarines attempt to put a stanglehold on England, isolating it from the rest of the Commonwealth and America.

It is impossible to suddenly switch from producing submarines to producing tanks. Players must decide early in the game what type of war they are going to conduct.

Legendary Showdown: Machines &amp; Magic is a game of comically epic battles where each player uses strategy, sabotage, and one-upmanship to develop a secret battle plan.  This lighthearted and easy-to-learn tabletop game is designed to be enjoyed by experienced gamers and newcomers alike.  Haven&rsquo;t read the comics before? No problem! No background reading is required to help your characters win battles and be the last one left standing! Let the mass chaos, devious strategies, and humorous battles begin!&#10;&#10;Who is this Girl Genius?&#10;Girl Genius is a three-time winner of the highest honor awarded for works of science fiction and fantasy: the prestigious Hugo Award.  The webcomic follows Agatha Clay, a seemingly mild-mannered mechanic who discovers she has inherited the abilities of a spark (a feared mad scientist with the natural ability to understand complex sciences and wield them for their own chaotic purposes). Even more shocking, Agatha discovers that she is the descendent of a long lost line of sparks whose unparalleled skills and insanity made them legends in their own time.  Cleverly written and beautifully illustrated by Kaja and Phil Foglio, Girl Genius is full of adventure, romance, and plenty of MAD SCIENCE!&#10;&#10;What is this &ldquo;Gunnerkrigg Court&rdquo; of which you speak?&#10;This highly praised comic is the work of the celebrated author and artist, Tom Siddell.  The story follows Antimony Carver as she attends an isolated boarding school called Gunnerkrigg Court.  Antimony soon learns that the Court is no ordinary school - the teachers are hiding ancient conspiracies, it is bordered by a forest full of dangerous monsters, and the school is inhabited by strange creatures and students with special abilities.  In the course of her adventures, Antimony befriends an ancient trickster god, discovers her own supernatural powers, and begins investigating the dark secrets of the court.&#10;&#10;Why do we love these comics so darn much?&#10;If you aren&rsquo;t already faithful readers, allow me to let you in on a little secret: these comics rock.  The stories are masterfully crafted, the art is top notch, and the characters are instantly endearing.  It's no wonder that these comics have won so many rewards and attracted such loyal fans.  We also appreciate that both comics feature characters who make great role models.  For example, Antimony Carver and Agatha Clay are some of the strongest and most intelligent women you could hope to meet and their friends will stop at nothing to stand by their sides.&#10;&#10;How to play the game that will... change your life:&#10;Each player is dealt a total of five characters from the worlds of Girl Genius and Gunnerkrigg Court.  These characters line up in anticipation for their chance to battle.  During the round, you try to equip characters in your line with powerful weapons and bonuses while equipping characters in other players&rsquo; lines with faulty or otherwise terrible equipment.  You can also give yourself secret advantages or sabotage your opponents.  When the round ends, the characters at the front of each line will engage in a (legendary) showdown.  But the madness doesn&rsquo;t stop there!  You can rearrange your line and the lines of your opponents to change who will be competing in the final battle.  The round suddenly ends when all players but one (the poor chap) are ready to fight.  At that point, each player reveals his or her battle strategy and the winner is decided.&#10;&#10;",

If you chose instead to Advance, you won't get any resources (and your neighbors will each gain 2 of their chosen resource), you will be able to purchase an Advancement card which will give you VPs and allow you to start building your engine. The game ends once one player reaches 25 or more VPs, and the player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

From picture cards showing situations or categories (e.g. shopping, fruit ...) you pick those you associate words with a given letter with.&#10;&#10;If S is drawn, you may e.g. pick the &quot;fruit&quot; card, because you associate &quot;strawberry&quot;. You put the card in front of you, bottom-up. However, as all players act simultaneously, you have to be fast. When one player has picked six pictures, scoring starts. You have to turn over the topmost card of your stack and immediately say what you associated. After you took turns doing so, whoever has the highest remaining number of cards gets 2 points, those with the second highest number of cards get 1 point.&#10;&#10;After 6 turns the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "They Live: Assault on Cable 54 is a narrative driven, adventure game that features hidden enemies inspired by the 1988 sci-fi classic.&#10;&#10;The main game features a cooperative campaign designed for 4-6 players taking the roles of Human or Invader (secondly a 1-2 Player Blind Play mode is currently in development). &#10;Most importantly, it includes a real-world working pair of Hoffman Lenses that not only make you feel more immersed in the world of the movie, but are also an integral part of the game.&#10;&#10;The adventure involves players exploring the city of LA to gain assets that will prepare them for the final push against the oppression of the Invaders.&#10; Players will assume the role of either a Human or an Invader, and that will determine if they plan to strengthen the resistance or sabotage their efforts to succeed. However, this role will be hidden from the other players, and can only be detected by using the Hoffman Lenses.&#10;&#10;Great effort has been taken to ensure that this feels like a living, breathing story within the world of the classic movie.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Can a simple drifter rise to lead the resistance against our Invaders?&#10;     Can a corrupt politician find redemption?&#10;     Can a tired detective track down an elusive Invader-targeting serial killer? &#10;&#10;&#10;These stories are told through a unique story deck for each character. The order of their deck is randomised, and how many cards it takes to complete your story depends on your success with each. This system means a different personal-story experience each time you play. &#10;Each story features different endings depending on if you&rsquo;re playing as a Human or an Invader. Completing them is optional, but doing so will reward you with unique character items and special skills to aid in overthrowing the Invaders, or sabotaging the resistance.&#10;&#10;The game contains a ticking timer that progresses towards a fixed deadline. In order to win the game, you need to get to Cable 54 and start the &lsquo;final assault&rsquo; before the clock hits midnight!&#10;&#10;The &lsquo;final assault&rsquo; contains three story-based trials that your team will need to overcome to win. Doing so will require high-level characters that players have developed throughout the game. You will also need a vast stash of weapons, items and allies to be victorious.&#10; Each of the three trials will test your skills, and require you to spend assets on improving your chances of successful dice rolls. It&rsquo;s during this assault that enemy players are most likely to reveal themselves, and spend their sabotaged goods on halting your progress.&#10;&#10;With the correct planning, the right equipment, and a little luck, you have the chance to stop the signal once and for all, and live on in legend as part of resistance history. &#10;If you fail, well, things will be a lot worse&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Based on Herman Melville's classic novel, Moby Dick combines cooperative and competitive play in an attempt to loosely simulate life on a 19th century whaleship.&#10;&#10;The game is centered around three decks of cards: the Sea, the Sailor, and the Whale. After receiving an initial crew of sailors, players take turns at the topmast, where they draw Sea cards to advance the game. These cards contain various creatures and events, compelling actions between players or triggering the secondary phase of the game &ndash; the whale hunt. During a whale hunt, each player begins by choosing a small group of their sailors to lower after the whale. Play progresses much like the primary gameplay, with players taking turns defending against the whale's assaults and returning the favors.&#10;&#10;As the game unfolds, players gain oil from defeating whales or from certain events, which can be used to hire new sailors after others are lost at sea. Over time, key events (Chapters) will be drawn, and after a certain number Moby Dick will cease evading the ship and engage when sighted. This last battle is to the death, and only one player will survive. Call him the winner, or simply, Ishmael.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the english rules:&#10;&#10;&quot;Get &lsquo;em up and hand over the dough!!&quot;&#10;Alongside fragrant lavender fields, picturesque alleys lined with cypresses show you the way &ndash; straight into the hands of marauding bandits. In the serpentine canyons of the gorges and under cover of shady pinewoods, sly outlaws are lurking for the purpose of urging moneyed noblemen, together with their irritated courtesans, out of their well-cushioned travel coaches in order to re-distribute their possessions.&#10;Therefore, experienced aristocrats take long detours and hire expensive escorts in order to avoid the daylight robbers.&#10;But the eloquent bandits are no fools. They besiege the byways also, and so, from behind inconspicuous curves, the thanks of the light-fingered crooks might be heard unexpectedly as they call out, &quot;Millie Grazie.&quot;&#10;&#10;The players are alternately noblemen and robbers. Whereas the noblemen want to head from town to town without being waylaid, the robbers lurk on the side of the road to prey on them.&#10;A nobleman tries to fulfil task cards, that can be found in one town and shall be brought into another town. Before he moves his pawn 4 or 5 streets from town to town, each other robber (the other players) decide on their &lsquo;ambush compass&lsquo; one street on which they lurk. If the nobleman uses a road on which robbers are lurking, the nobleman is waylaid and robbed. A robber who is successful gets victory points. The nobleman robbed loses a number of task cards (if he has bad luck it's just the task one step away of fulfilling).&#10;If a nobleman reaches a town with a task card he should bring to that town, he gains the victory points printed on the task card.&#10;Before moving at all, but after the robbers decided secretly the street they are lurking, the nobleman has the choice to hire a guard for exactly one street on his way. On that street he is safe and cannot be robbed, though he can only move 4 streets, not 5 as he is allowed without guard.&#10;The first to reach 30 victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Very good variant of Scrabble. Scoring is easier and allows for tactics in trying to outscore your opponent. The game can be forced to an end by reaching the bonus end-fields.&#10;&#10;Lingua was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 17x17 board, the squares being one of four colours or white. A &quot;Start&quot; square is near one corner and there are four &quot;finish&quot; squares in the opposite corner. There are 132 tiles each being in one of the four board colours and players each start with 12 of these and top up to 12 after their turn.&#10;&#10;The first player must play a legal word through the Start square and thereafter players must play a word that intersects orthogonally with at least one existing word in crossword fashion. Intersection may be achieved by playing a word that adds a letter at the beginning or end of an existing word except the adding of a plural &quot;S&quot; is not allowed.&#10;&#10;You score for every letter in the word(s) created. Basic scoring is by tile colour, blue=1, yellow=2, green=3 and red=4.&#10;However, if you play a tile that matches the board square tile you have made an ACE. Each ACE initially scores a bonus or 10 in addition to normal score. After a player has made ten ACES, future scores are doubled, after 15 ACES trebled etc.&#10;&#10;There is a bonus of 25 if you form a word with all the letters of the same colour (a Colourword).&#10;&#10;The games ends when a). Players can no longer form words, b). when a player can no longer top up to 12 or c). when a player plays a word that goes over one or more of the Finish squares where they will earn the finish square bonus(es).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cthulhu Crusades is a fast-paced card game, as much about chance as strategy, set in the dark Middle Ages under the sway of the Necronomicon. Storm the castle walls, make sacrificial offerings, invoke and call up creatures in this highly snappy card game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, your objective is to storm the enemy castle and take possession of their copy of the Necronomicon. The shields represent the defense value of the castle, and to storm a castle, you have to carry out an attack (swords) superior to its defenses (shields). To launch an attack, you should gather army formations, which are represented by soldiers, bowmen, and siege weapons cards. (You can attack with one or several cards at once.) Note that a castle cannot be attacked while its walls protect it.&#10;&#10;The village deck provides the basic resources of your village: soldiers, archers, gold, cultists, sacrifices, builders, thieves, etc. You start with five cards, and on each turn you steal a card from this deck and carry out one single action: attack, defend, build, &#3;call up, sacrifice, etc. Lay ambushes for your enemies, steal their gold, and surprise them with a night-time attack so they can't tell what you're attacking them with. Use the arcane knowledge of your cultists to call up the powerful creatures of the Cthulhu deck and scare the wits out of your rival while in combat.&#10;&#10;The siege deck contains siege weapons to carry out more powerful attacks, and you can use builders and gold to construct your siege weapons. Get special cards to scale the walls with greater speed and trick your enemies with the Cthulhu offering.&#10;&#10;The sea hides the terrible Deep Ones. If you manage to keep them happy by offering sacrifices, they will reward you with additional resources &mdash; but you never know how many Deep Ones might come!&#10;&#10;",

One player (the House) takes the role of the Evil Entity that has spun its web of power over the Darkholm Manor. The other players (called the Hunters) each represent a ghost hunter who has entered the house one dark night to confront and banish its evil.&#10;&#10;The battle against the House takes place on two planes. On the Astral Plane, the Hunters try to reach and exorcise the Entity hidden in the heart of darkness of the House. The Hunters must advance along the 12 Axes of Power, weakening the House and destroying its web of evil by exorcising the Entity's power from individual rooms in the Manor. The House tries to trap the Hunter's Psyches and cast their Astral bodies adrift on this plane.&#10;&#10;On the Material Plane, the physical manifestation of the House, the Hunters search for discoveries to help them on the Astral Plane, as the House materializes Physical and Psychic Haunts against them through its Foci of Evil. The House tries to take possession of the Hunter's physical bodies, destroy them, and absorb their souls. The Hunters use various tools and strengths to defend themselves against the Haunts.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What If the Japanese Invaded? (IPH). It&rsquo;s a low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic/operational-level, alternative history wargame of the campaign that could've resulted had the Japanese decided to launch an amphibious invasion of Oahu at the same time as their historic air raid. The game is intended for two players, one commanding the Japanese and the other commanding the US forces. The game system is focused so as to present the ground-commanders&rsquo; views of the campaign. Aero-naval operations &ndash; though certainly important in play &ndash; are presented more abstractly than would be the case in a design centered on those aspects of the campaign.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the 34x22 large-hex map equals one mile (1.62 km) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents about four hours of daylight or an entire night. Playing pieces (176 iconic counters) represent ground units of approximately company size, or individual aircraft carriers or battleships, or enough aircraft sorties (about two to three dozen) needed to affect battlefield events at this scale. The rules contain a little less than 11,000 words. Two experienced players can finish a match in less than four hours.&#10;&#10;The single counterfactual assumption underlying the game is Adm. Yamamoto decided to back the plan he scrapped historically in September 1941. That plan had called for an amphibious invasion, conducted by about two regiments, to land on Oahu at the same time as the air attacks were begun. The further supposition then is, the Japanese, once ashore, would&rsquo;ve had no more than about three days in which to achieve their now more ambitious goal: either secure the whole island or at least fight their way across enough of it &ndash; while thoroughly wrecking facilities as they came to them &ndash; to ensure the American recovery would be delayed as long as possible. The three-day limit is due to the fact that, by the end of that period, the Japanese carrier strike group would had to have withdrawn and the ground force&rsquo;s initial load of combat supply would be used up.&#10;&#10;Rules cover such things as: variable landing sites, rough surf, carrier interventions, combat ground support, interdiction, a Nisei uprising, Ford Island and Battleship Row, night combat, banzai attacks and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. Carrier Warfare Phase (only Game Turns 5 &amp; 9)&#10;A. Ship Disposition Segment&#10;B. Carrier Combat Segment&#10;II. US Submarine Attack Phase (only Game Turns 5 through 11)&#10;III. Japanese Landing Phase&#10;IV. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*&#10;V. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*&#10;VI. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*&#10;VII. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*&#10;&#10;&#10;    May be preceded or followed by the Japanese Movement or Combat Phase, to the limit of one of such Japanese phase being executed per game turn upon that player&rsquo;s declarations of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine: World at War #14&#10;&#10;",

Since 1947, Pakistan and India have been military rivals and have fought several wars. Those wars, however, have been inconclusive. Since 1998, both nations have become nuclear powers and, consequently, the next Indo-Pakistani war could potentially become nuclear. Indeed, another war between Pakistan and India may be the final showdown.&#10;&#10;Showdown utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From attack helicopters to self-propelled artillery, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. Showdown also introduces a new and disconcerting element: tactical nuclear weapons. Both Pakistan and India now have sizeable nuclear arsenals, and thus what begins as a conventional war may erupt into a nuclear exchange.&#10;&#10;In Showdown, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses likely to be sustained during another Indo-Pakistani war. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management, particularly with regard to nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;",

In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer. When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers. No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances. A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition. Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.&#10;&#10;This version of Pictionary, the beloved game of quick sketches and hilarious guesses, features a different board for faster gameplay. There are also two levels of clues (1,200 adult and 800 junior) so that everyone can play. Designed for 3 or more players. Recommended for ages 8 and over.&#10;&#10;",

In preparation for the game someone has spray-painted 100 logs in 5 different colors, and stacked them in a huge round tower with layers of 6 logs arranged randomly.&#10;&#10;A player takes a free log from the tower and uses it to build his own tower. Each player may only&#10;construct 3 towers and only the bottom log of each tower may touch the table. When a player feels he cannot extend a tower any further he can crown it with a white cap. This prevents any further building on that tower and ensures double scoring. (After scoring the topmost piece is removed.)&#10;&#10;When all logs from the central tower has been used, there is final scoring, and the woodcutter with the most points wins a brand-new chain saw.&#10;&#10;Also included are 3 variants:&#10;&#10;&quot;Easy Going&quot;: The players build up to 5 individual towers, but each of only a single color. The base may be formed from more than one log, but cannot be expanded after the next level has been started.  Scoring is for the highest tower in each color at the end of the game. Logs from collapsed towers are lost.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pyramido&quot;: Players build the pyramids with single color surfaces.&#10;&#10;&quot;Log Cabin&quot;: Build small houses using as few colors as possible.&#10;&#10;Above based on Brett &amp; Board which thanks Adam Spielt for use of the description.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This chess-like variant is themed around the military formations used by the Ancient Greeks. Each player has 15 identical pieces that are set up on opposite sides of the board, which is comprised of an 8 x 8 playing field of squares that is further divided diagonally in alternate fashion (see picture). Pieces are comprised of: 8 small triangles of various orientation (Auxiliaries), 4 squares (Archers), which are the size of two Auxiliaries, 2 Hoplites (which are the size of an Archer with a Auxiliary on top), and 1 Syntagma, a larger triangle (the size of 2 Auxiliaries combined). Since each piece must always be oriented to face it's owner (diagram for set-up is printed on the board), you'll find that some pieces are not interchangeable with others of the same type (like Hoplites and Auxiliaries). This is important as all movement is done by moving pieces diagonally, horizontally or vertically along paths that are not blocked and the piece must end on a space where the board outline matches his piece.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture or &quot;Phalanx&quot; your opponents pieces - not by jumping (Checkers) or by taking it's place on the board (Chess), but by surrounding it on two of it's sides with your pieces. A multiple Phalanx attack is possible if a move surrounds several of his opponents pieces with a single move. When 14 of a players 15 pieces are captured, that player can no longer win and is eliminated. Tied or games that are a draw (you can play to a time limit as well) are determined by the value of each players remaining pieces, which are from 5 - 20 points each.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Day of the Dead is a highly strategic card game that turns you and a friend into necromancers! Summon the best team of undead fighters and in six turns you&rsquo;ll be named Super Grand Master, a highly coveted and extremely descriptive title.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each necromancer is given a hand containing nine cards. They represent an eccentric collection of skeletons, zombies, vampires, ghouls, and other spooks. Each turn, you select one of these weird characters and send it to the field. Once your opponent has done the same, the fun begins! All the fighters pair off and fight to the death. Normally, this sort of thing would be dangerous, but undead are durable and really get into the spirit of the thing.&#10;&#10;Winners score points while losers are flipped face down. Undead are resilient, so losing fighters will reassemble themselves in time for next turn&rsquo;s battle. But if you don&rsquo;t think your losing fighter will do better next turn, you can pull him out of line and turn him into a spirit. Spirits are the ultimate fans, boosting the power of all of your fighters. Some spirits even let you replace weaker fighters!&#10;&#10;Strategy in Day of the Dead centers around positioning; when played in the right place, any fighter can be a champion. On the other hand, even your favorite fighter can be a total failure if you are too stubborn to pull him out of a losing matchup. Stay flexible and you will bury your competition.&#10;&#10;Turn Order&#10;&#10;     Summoning &mdash; When you bring new cards to the field.&#10;         A New Slot Opens &mdash; Each turn a new slot opens up on the field for both players. On the first turn, each player takes a card from their hand and places it as a fallen fighter in this new slot. On each turn after that, they will take their current spirit card and place it there.&#10;         Play a New Card &mdash; Fighters start their undeath as spirits, face down and slightly below the field. Spirits are also rotated 90 degrees to show that they are special. When considering what card to play, remember that you can only have 2 cards of each back in play. On turn 6, the final turn, you are allowed to break this rule and choose whatever card back you want.&#10;         The Field Becomes Active &mdash; Flip all cards on the field face up (except for your spirit, it&rsquo;s not on the field though it&rsquo;s watching with considerable interest). If any player chose an Unearth card to be their spirit, they resolve this effect now. Then you&rsquo;re ready to fight!&#10;    &#10;     Fighting &mdash; When your fighters get to work.  Fights resolve one by one, starting with the newest slot and going to the oldest. Fights are 1 on 1 affairs and follow rigid rules. Be aware of what spirits each player has, as they will affect the outcome of each fight.&#10;         Use Effects &mdash; Starting with the player who has the Priority counter, both fighters use their effects. Fighters must use their effects if able.If a player has a Double card as their spirit, they use their fighter&rsquo;s effect, then immediately use it again.&#10;         Add Up the Power &mdash; Add on the printed power of each fighter to any bonuses they may have accumulated via effects or spirits (Remember, if a player has a Power Up card as their spirit, they will get +2 power this fight).&#10;         Compare Power &mdash; The higher-powered fighter is declared winner (in the event of a tie, both fighters are considered winners) and stays active. The lower-powered fighter is declared the loser and flips face down, becoming fallen.&#10;         The Loser May Become a Spirit  &mdash; If your fighter lost its fight this turn and you want to try something new, you can pull it from line and turn it into a spirit.&#10;         Move on to the Next Fight &#10;    &#10;     Rewards &mdash; When you gain victory points.&#10;         Score Victory Points &mdash; Each player scores victory points equal to the printed power values on their active fighters. Fallen cards score no points. Use the score board to keep track of it all.&#10;         Pass Priority &mdash; The player who currently has the priority counter passes it to the other player. Next turn, that player will be able to use their effects first. This turn is now over!&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;&#10;     At the end of 6 turns, a winner is declared. Whoever has the most victory points is that amazing person/&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Get ready to embark on the craziest vacation ever! A herd of mischievous bulls has taken over the quaint town of El Toro, and players must outrun &amp; outwit them in order to get to the fabulous destinations on the coast! Skillfully play cards to dodge the rascally bulls as they chase you through the streets! The dice themselves are the Runners, and you must maipulate them to determine both their paths &amp; those of the Bulls themselves! It's all a bit like strategic pachinko! With a bit of planning &amp; lot of luck, you&rsquo;ll reach your spectacular getaway while Running with the Bulls!&#10;&#10;In the game, players use handfuls of dice as runners, starting them at the top of the game board and playing cards to reroll those runners or influence opposing runners, with your goal for each of the three days being to get your runners to the fancy destinations (which are worth differing amounts of points) at the bottom of the board while avoiding the bulls that are chasing you.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Emperor is dead. The law says that if there is more than one heir to the throne, a Lunar War must take place in order to determine the new ruler of the Empire.&#10;&#10;The Lunar War will last for 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 3 seconds &ndash; one full lunar cycle of the long forgotten planet Earth.&#10;&#10;The warfare will rage on the specially designated, uninhabited sector located at the frontiers of the Empire. The ancient, automatic factories and shipyards will be opened again, for the first time in many decades. The right of succession will depend on the shrewdness, skills and courage of the Fleet commanders and on their strategically distributed forces.&#10;&#10;The best will win and throw the corpses of their fallen enemies beneath the throne of the new, victorious emperor!&#10;&#10;Lunation is a game based on numerous negative interactions between the players and area control elements. During the seven turns of the game, the players explore space, obtain Systems, build Fleets and recruit Characters in order to pulverize their enemies with procured resources and pure military force.&#10;&#10;Become the ruler of the Empire!&#10;Lunation is a dynamic game about space conquest and war. The players&rsquo; task is to claim the throne of the Empire. They fight each other to determine one person powerful enough to seize the power.&#10;&#10;During the seven turns of the game, the players explore planetary Systems, build Fleets and recruit Characters in order to subdue their opponents with collected resources or pure military power.&#10;&#10;Simple and comprehensible: Lunation is not complicated in terms of rules and it is easy to learn;&#10;Negative interactions: apart from trading, virtually all other aspects of the interaction between the players lead to bloodshed;&#10;High replayability: due to the considerable number of cards, a draft system &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; into the game preparation process and numerous diversified strategies leading to victory, no two games will be the same;&#10;Dynamic combat: Lunation players use special dice that make it possible to quickly determine the result of the confrontation (without any counting!). Moreover, Action Cards, special properties of the Characters and a certain special feature of the dice add some elements of uncertainty to the result of each battle;&#10;Many ways to win: combat is not the only method that can be used to obtain the highest number of Victory Points and eternal glory &ndash; a player can also win by fulfilling Secret Goals and gathering Resources!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Well dream on.&#10;&#10;Succession ends when the aging King chooses a successor to the throne.  Of all the worthy citizens of the land, the King has narrowed his choice to five candidates.  You are not one of them.&#10;&#10;As a courtier, master of palace politics, you will manipulate the King's opinion of the candidates through intrigues -- bits of gossip, good and bad reports, etc.  Just as important, by claiming credit for things you may not have done and avoiding blame for things you probably did you'll manipulate the opinions of the candidates.  That way when the King makes his selection you're set to be the power behind the throne rather than the next court jester.&#10;&#10;To do this, you'll have to out-bluff and out-maneuver the other players, manage your resources carefully and decide when to fight and when to sit on the sidelines and watch your opponents beat each other up.&#10;&#10;Succession is a game of politics and deal-making lasting from one to three hours (1-2 hours is typical).  You can offer other players gold, cards, or promises of future behavior in exchange for what you want.  Be creative!&#10;&#10;Succession was launched at GenCon Indi 2004.&#10;&#10;",
