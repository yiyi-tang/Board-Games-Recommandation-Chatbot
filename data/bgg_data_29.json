    "Description": "Small Samurai Empires is an action-programming area-control game for 2-4 players, where players are fighting for control of Japan with their armies of Samurai!&#10;&#10;A game of Small Samurai Empires is played in 3 Eras, each consisting of 2 rounds. Each round, players will take turns placing order tokens facedown on one of the slots available in the 4 regions of Japan. When all players have placed their tokens and filled all the token slots, they will be revealed and resolved one by one by the owner of the token. These order tokens will enable the players to recruit mighty Samurai armies, move their armies to conquer provinces, build castles to defend and maintain control of their provinces and do other meaningful actions.&#10;&#10;At the end of each of the three Eras, players will score points depending on the regions they control and their value, which can change during as the game progresses. Finally, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Trash Pandas, players are raucous raccoons, tipping over trash cans for food (and shiny objects). Players push their luck to acquire more cards, but must stash them in order for them to count as points at the end of the game. When the deck runs out, the game ends and players compare their stashes to see who has the majority for each card type and score points accordingly.  The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;In more detail, on a turn the active player rolls a die in the hope of gaining the benefit of the roll result. With each roll, the player decides to keep rolling or stop and activate the dice results. However, with each additional roll, the odds of busting (getting a duplicate result) increase further and the player risks losing the progress they've made that round. When activating the dice results, the player will draw cards, steal cards from other players, and stash cards. Cards in hand may be used for their listed ability, but they count as points only when stashed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In each version, the object of the game revolves around using a plastic axe to tap a tree made out of individual flat segments without causing any segments to fall out of the tree.&#10;&#10;Tok Tok Woodman First edition:&#10;A very simple dexterity game with 12 large wooden discs, a wooden axe, and a die. The discs are stacked as a tower. A player turn consists of rolling the die and then hitting the tower with the axe. For example, if you roll a five, you have to hit the fifth disc five times with the axe. The player causing the tower to fall loses.&#10;&#10;Toc Toc Woodman Second edition: &#10;A dexterity game where nine plastic tree segments are stacked up.  Each tree segment has four bark sections around it.  On their turn, a player gets two taps with the axe to try and knock off pieces of bark from the tree segments for one point a piece. But be careful, if a tree segment comes down it's minus 5 points! A quick unique dexterity game.&#10;&#10;Click Clack Lumberjack First edition:&#10;Very similar to Toc Toc Woodman Second edition, but adds some optional grub stickers which you may apply to bark pieces in order to add various rules for the grub.  Also comes in smaller, more portable packaging and at a lower price point.&#10;&#10;",

The cradle of modern humans, called Homo sapiens by scientists, was located in Africa more than 100,000 years ago. The first branches of this family began a journey that spanned thousands of years. Eventually leading them to Australia and America. The enormous difficulties of this journey were overcome because of Homo sapiens' unique ability to adapt to its environment. Their highly developed brains and their mastery of crafts enabled them to flourish in even the harshest conditions.&#10;&#10;In this exciting game, you will guide the journey of one of these branches. You must strive to spread your people over the whole world. In order to expand your branch of humanity, you must develop certain talents: advances in the preparation of food will allow your people to spread faster and wider, while new hunting techniques can protect them from dangers. And your people will need warm clothes to cross the ice deserts of the north and boats to settle Australia.&#10;&#10;Of course, all of this is possible only if you have enough raw materials: meat, hides, bones and flint.&#10;&#10;There are many paths that you may follow to victory. But it is certain that the player that settles in the most productive lands, trades for missing raw materials with the other players most skillfully, and is able to best penetrate the lands of Australia and America, will end the game with their nose in front!&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series and is retroactively a member of Catan Histories.&#10;&#10;",

Ruled by a weak and mentally unstable king, Henry VI, demoralized by the defeat in France at the end of the Hundred Years War, and encouraged by the ambitions of Richard, Duke of York, and his sons; the country's noble families used their large private armies in attempts to gain control of the throne.&#10; The game is based on the premise that the powerful Noble families used the Lancastrian and Yorkist princes as pawns in a greater struggle to gain control of England. The nobles in a player's faction use their military and political powers to gain control of royal heirs in an effort to crown one and put him or her on the throne. Of course everyone is out to capture and control the last heir alive, so once acquired, an heir needs to be protected. &#10; Kingmaker has been published by several companies, starting with Philmar under their Ariel imprint in 1974, by Avalon Hill in 1976, by Gibsons Games in 1983, and by TM Games in 1988/9. In 2023, Gibsons Games published a new edition, which has its own entry under Kingmaker (2023).&#10;&#10;",

Each of the twelve rounds of the game starts with the revelation of a &quot;memory card&quot;, which shows one of six patterns that players can build on their image board with image tokens that they draft. Over multiple rounds, you'll compile image tokens next to one another, and if you have the right tokens in the right shape, you suddenly &quot;remember&quot; the building that matches the shape and image, placing that building on the shared common map and scoring points for it. You can additionally score points for completing buildings with image tokens that match buildings remembered by others, i.e., that they placed on the common board earlier. You've now remembered that building, too!&#10;&#10;Each player also has objective cards and photo memory cards, and you can score points for satisfying them. If you can't fit all of your image fragments into play, you lose points for scattered thoughts. For more difficult play, you can use the 7x6 area on the Kyoto or Singapore game board instead of the regular 7x7 area.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a semi-cooperative game which puts the &quot;thief&quot; against the rest of the players, who take the role of detectives.  As the thief, you secretly plot your movements around a private art museum.  As you go, the detectives take turns trying to find you with their eyes, the video cameras, or motion detectors.  You can deactivate the cameras, and you can even cut off the power to the entire museum to mask your movements.  Another advantage is that the thief gets a turn after every detective's individual turn.&#10;&#10;Another problem for the detectives is the fact that, once the thief has picked up a painting, she can take her next turn before removing the painting from the gameboard.  The good guys know the vicinity, but won't know her exact location, as the thief is now up to 3 squares away from that spot. If a detective ever spots you with the naked eye, secret movement is over, and the thief's token is placed on the board for all to see.  This can get frantic, since the thief can only move 1-3 spaces, while detectives roll a d6 for movement!&#10;&#10;The thief player has to decide when to attempt a getaway. The catch is, some of the windows and doors are locked.  There are actual lock pieces, and you must flip over the one you are attempting to open (instant detective frenzy!). If she has stolen 3 paintings (in a one-off game), and manages to get out, she wins.  In a tournament style game, each player gets a turn at being the thief, so the number of paintings needed will vary based on the other players' scores.&#10;&#10;1991 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;Also selected by Family Fun Magazine as one of the best games.&#10;&#10;Original name by inventors was Heist.

    "Description": "This is Warcry &ndash; a new skirmish game from the makers of Kill Team and Warhammer Underworlds that allows you to experience the visceral carnage of battle in the Mortal Realms in a whole new way.&#10;&#10;This is more than just a skirmish version of Warhammer Age of Sigmar &ndash; it&rsquo;s hyper-kinetic, it&rsquo;s tactical and it&rsquo;s very, very bloody, featuring bold new game mechanics.&#10;&#10;Warcry is perfect for narrative players looking to forge character-driven campaigns where warbands grow and develop through their own journey. Meanwhile, gamers looking for a close-matched, fast and exciting experience will find a game that fits both their coffee table and coffee break.&#10;&#10;In the game, you&rsquo;ll follow the myriad tribes of Chaos &ndash; reavers and despoilers from every corner of the realms &ndash; as they make their dark pilgrimage to the Varanspire. Warcry explores a never-before-seen side of life (and death!) in the Age of Sigmar. Every model for this game is brand new, reflecting on the dizzying diversity of Chaos on a scale never attempted before and rooted in rich lore that realises the servants of the Dark Gods as deep and varied cultures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is set in the Perry Rhodan universe, a hugely popular German space-opera book series published since 1961. The term &quot;kosmisch&quot; means &quot;cosmic&quot;; &quot;Hanse&quot; refers to the Hanseatic League, a Medieval trade network in Northern Europe. In the american translation of the book series the phrase &quot;Die Kosmische Hanse&quot; was translated as &quot;The Cosmic House&quot;.&#10;&#10;In this game the players take on the roles of traders who transport goods between planets. Occasionally one can carry also passengers, which bring additional profit. Players can invest in cargo space, transmitters, or faster drives to improve their spaceships.&#10;&#10;Heinrich Glumpler, the designer of the game, is a fan of Merchant of Venus, as you can see from this comment.&#10;&#10;The artwork is by Swen Papenbrock, one of the illustrators of the Perry Rhodan book series.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;&#10; Game Summary&#10;Place the 6 planet cards in a line. The goods cards are double-sided; randomize them, then place several on each planet grouped by type (but no more than 2/type/planet to start). Each has their own deck, shuffled; draw 5 card hand. The cards are mostly tech cards, which can give you ongoing power; or single-use cards (counter opponent's card by playing matching card yourself). Each player begins with one card in play. This card gives each player one container and one replenishment. One player decides whether to go first or choose on which planet both planets will start. The other player gets the other option.&#10;&#10;On one's turn a player may do these actions in any order:&#10;- Flight&#10;- Two Interventions (play cards that don't have the &infin; on them)&#10;- Take two Planetary Actions (load, unload, or buy an &infin; card)&#10;&#10;When a player unloads, the delivered cards are flipped over; any resulting matches are removed from game, slowly reducing the available loads and potentially ending the game! You win by getting reaching a target 70 VP. If all goods are removed, then most VP wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After many years of trying to defeat the diseases that threaten mankind&rsquo;s existence, the tables have been turned.  You are now the disease and guess what?  There is no cure.&#10;&#10;In Pandemic: Contagion, you are competing against other diseases (fellow players) to see who can eliminate humanity. With no cure to be had, the one of you that wipes out all human civilization will come out on top as the most deadly disease ever known to man, may he rest in peace.&#10;&#10;Pandemic: Contagion includes a deck of contagion cards with differing colored borders, city cards with similar colored borders, event/WHO cards, player disease card and disease cubes. On a turn you take two of three possible actions, and you can take the same action twice. Those actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw contagion cards equal to your current incubation rate.&#10;     Advance one of three mutations to the next level.&#10;     Spread disease equal to your current transmission rate.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the number of diseases equals the city&rsquo;s population number, the city is wiped out.  The player who placed the final disease earns a special action. The player with the most diseases scores the population number. The two smaller numbers are awarded to those with the second- and third-most diseases.&#10;&#10;Your disease card has three mutations: Incubation (number of cards you can draw), Transmission (number of disease cubes you can spread), and Resistance (number of cubes/cards you can protect). As an action, you can advance a mutation one level by discarding the required number of cards.&#10;&#10;Event cards are drawn at the start of each round and affect everyone during their turn. You might benefit from the card or it could have a negative impact. WHO cards are always bad, but your resistance will lessen whatever the penalty would be based on its level, if you planned ahead.&#10;&#10;Mid-game scoring occurs when the second, fourth and sixth skull comes out.  When a city icon appears, a new city is introduced.&#10;&#10;Once the event/WHO deck runs out or only two city cards remain in play, the game ends, with players conducting a final scoring round to see which virus is victorious.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;",

Now it's time to hit the Campaign Trail! How will you chart your path to victory? Engage in grass roots campaigning, advertise, sling mud at opponents, fundraise, debate, and so much more! But be sure to avoid revealing those skeletons you have buried in your closet. The candidate who best manages their resources and connects with the public on key issues will win the presidency!&#10;&#10;Campaign Trail uses card driven actions to implement your strategy. Your goal is to have the most voters for your party in enough states to win a majority of electoral votes. If you have the most voters in a state you are awarded that state's electoral votes (victory points). At the end of the game the player with the most electoral votes wins and is declared the president!&#10;&#10;On your turn you play a card and take an action from that card. Each card has a choice among 4 of the game's 6 actions. You may (depending on what is on your card):&#10;&#10;&#10;     Fundraise - Add money to your war chest to be spent later on advertising campaigns and campaign rallies.&#10;     Register - Add voters to your registered voter supply so that they can commit to vote for you in the various states.&#10;     Travel - Move your candidate around the United States to set yourself up for large campaign rallies in key states.&#10;     Advertise - Create and implement advertising campaigns based on the issues of the day. Each time you advertise you will receive voters in the states that care about the issues you covered.&#10;     Campaign - Hold local campaign rallies where your candidate is located. Campaigning allows you to gain large numbers of voters in the state(s) you are in and adjacent to.&#10;     Hold Event - Hold various political events. Some may give votes, some may increase resources, all are helpful.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to the base of card driven mechanics and area control, you will have a candidate card which gives you an individual player power. You will also have the opportunity to debate the current issues with your opponent. And finally, through the use of event cards, you can build up an engine to help out with resource production.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Howdy, ya'll.&#10;C'mon in and sit a spell. Let me tell ya about Jack Colty and his gang, and get ya up to gallop on all the interestin' events. Those filthy drovers and gunslingers are dangerous and desperate, each one generally havin' killed a man, and be content to live on a diet of Navy plug and whiskey.&#10;I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after hearin' this here stupefyin' story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess you folks can make up yer own minds why I retired early.&#10;&#10;The year is 1892.&#10;The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed.&#10;Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as Colty's gang shot its way, whooping and hollering, out of town.&#10;Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he'd steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man's eyes - and his gang to justice.&#10;&#10;Revolver is a non-collectable card game set in the Old West.&#10;&#10;Consisting of two balanced 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang.&#10;&#10;At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang's deck: Cherokee Scout, &quot;Adios, Amigoes!&quot;, &quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma'am&quot;, and &quot;Chew on this, Gringo!&quot;&#10;&#10;The Colonel player's objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, &quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind&quot;, &quot;He shot my hat clean off!&quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of &quot;Fire at will, boys.&quot;&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he's free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he's as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as 'coming-into-play' effects, and if a gringo has 'True Grit'.&#10;&#10;Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It's War.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to &quot;Escape across the Mexican border.&quot;&#10;The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train.&#10;The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed.&#10;The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train.&#10;&#10;Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character's deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in &quot;Kittens&quot; Mackenzie's case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bloodstones is a fantasy wargame for 1-6 players featuring six different races, each with its own specific powers and its own mix of units, represented by domino-shaped tiles. Some of these units will be unique to that race, such as dragons to the Dragon Riders and giants to the Hill Folk.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have the most victory points, which can be gained by building your own villages and raiding those of other players and by winning battles.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players arrange their tiles in stacks. From these, they draw a starting hand of nine. Players then decide where to place their citadel and which tiles will be placed with it. The tiles are multi-use. When placed on the board, they become units, with the type indicated by the symbol in the center. In your hand, tiles can be used to build other units, move units, improve your combat strength, build villages, and raid villages.&#10;&#10;The main part of the game proceeds with player turns. On your turn, you can perform as many actions as you wish, although some actions have restrictions as to when you can perform them. After you have completed your actions, draw back to your hand size of six tiles. If you exhaust your stock of tiles, then shuffle your discarded ones to make a new draw stock. You also score victory points for villages you have on the board.&#10;&#10;The game ends when each player has scored points a number of times. With two players, this will be three times; for three or more players, two times.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Worth +1 to +6 points&#10;12 x Fishbone (red) ... Worth -1 to -4 points&#10;&#10;Players roll dice to try and collect &quot;Sushi&quot; and &quot;Fish Bone&quot; tiles from the centre of the board (the tile they get depends how many they rolled).&#10;&#10;Players can also steal tiles from other players by rolling 3 or more appropriately coloured &quot;Chopsticks&quot; on their dice.  3 Chopsticks allows you to take the top tile from an appropriate pile from another player, 4 or 5 chopsticks allows you to nominate which tile from the pile you want, but you are not allowed to look first.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game (when the tiles are all gone), players score points based on the tiles they have collected, however if you have more blue tiles than red tiles, you lose the excess blue tiles first!&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch.&#10;&#10;",

He can choose to travel with his people by using the big wooden footprint piece, then smaller footpints to mark their path and block other players. He can buy materials to worship the gods: dancers, farm produce, impressive temples, or prayers. He can use these offerings to take a god token, which may grant him special abilities as well as victory points. Finally, he may build monuments that are worth victory points at the end of the game.

With the exception of the 0-value gangsters, a player normally needs two identical gangsters (same family and same value) to be able to take a gangster with the next highest value of the same family. When a player does this, they place one of the smaller gangsters from their hand into their play area. To get higher-valued gangsters faster, the player may use the special abilities of the different families at the cost of placing more gangsters in their play area. By doing so, a player may reduce their options and so must carefully plan these actions in order to end the game with the most influential gang.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Age of Comics: The Golden Years Age of Comics: The Golden Years is a worker placement management game in which players will run a publishing company during the golden age of comics (1938-54).&#10;&#10;In each round the players, in turn, must position 4 meeples (workers called editors). They can choose 4 out of 6 spaces, called publishing tasks. There are 6 publishing tasks in total that can be performed in any order and lead to 6 specific player actions: hire, develop, ideas, print, sales, and royalties. When a player prints a comic book she must pay using monetary resources ($) + 2 identical token ideas and display, on the table, the comic book cover and, underneath, show both a writer and an artist card. The comics&rsquo; value (needed for collecting orders on the map) will be the sum of the value of its creatives (artist + writer). Each creative card has a value ranging from 1 to 3.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 rounds. The objective of the game is to accumulate the highest number of fans, make money by publishing comics and create the best portfolio of comic books. There are three main ways to accumulate fans:&#10;&#10;     being the first to publish a specific genre and specializing in it;&#10;     publishing comic books with specialized creatives;&#10;     collecting orders on the map.&#10;&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, a fan chart will track the number of fans accumulated by the comics and will award victory points based on the players&rsquo; ranking at the end of every round. In the last round, the number of fans is converted into victory points. The money accumulated is instead divided by 4.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who scores the most victory points (VP from now on, represented by a star icon)&#10;at the end of five rounds. VP are awarded both during and at the end of the game by:&#10;&#10;     Publishing original comic books&#10;     Accumulating fans&#10;     Being at the top of the comic book chart every round&#10;     Earning money (but pay attention to taxes)&#10;     Generating ideas&#10;     Improving the printing quality&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a 4x4 grid, and to complete set up, each player takes four tiles at random, then places them in order from low to high down the diagonal that goes from upper left to lower right.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you take either a face-down tile from the pile or a face-up tile from the table. You can (1) place this tile in an empty space in your grid, (2) swap this tile for a tile already in the grid, or (3) discard this tile face-up on the table. However, all tiles in your grid must obey one rule at all times: A tile must be higher in value that any tile directly above it or to its immediate left and lower in value that any tile directly below it or to its immediate right. Whoever first fills their grid with sixteen tiles wins. (If the draw pile runs out, then whoever has the most tiles in their grid wins.)&#10;&#10;You can play Lucky Numbers tournament style by playing multiple games and having each player start once. The winner of a game receives 2 points, while each loser receives -1 point for each empty space in their grid. After as many games as the number of players, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The 2020 edition of Lucky Numbers includes a solo mode with forty puzzles to solve.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, decide whether to continue with an expedition or start a new one. Acceleration fields and artifacts provide opportunities to advance quickly, but you'll have to carefully consider which paths to take on which roll. If you make good progress, victory beckons &mdash; but if an expedition gets stuck, you will lose points just as quickly as you earned them!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has their own score sheet, which has eight columns on it: six colored columns matching the colors of Lost Cities (red/orange/yellow/green/blue/purple), an artefact column, and a dice column. You will fill or mark all of these columns from the bottom up.&#10;&#10;On a turn as the active player, you roll the six dice &mdash; three six-sided color dice and three ten-sided dice numbered 0-9 &mdash; then choose one number die and one color die, then mark this number in this color column on your sheet. If you choose 0 and haven't started this color column, you can mark the &quot;double point&quot; circle at the bottom of the column. If you choose a non-0 number and haven't started this column, you write the number in the bottommost space of the column; if you have started this column, then you can add another number to this column only if it's the same value or higher. (A 0 is written as 10 in a column.) Other players choose a number die and a color die from the two of each that remain, then mark one of their columns in a similar manner.&#10;&#10;If you place a number on an arrow in a column, then you can &quot;accelerate&quot; any color column by filling the bottommost empty space with the same number currently at the top of that column. If you write over another arrow, then you accelerate once again! If you place a number on an artefact box, then you mark off a space in the artefact column. If you've filled all nine spaces in a column and can write a number there once again, you instead mark off an artefact.&#10;&#10;If you wish, you can refuse to choose a number-color combination. If you do, then you mark off a die in the dice column.&#10;&#10;If you write a number in the seventh box in a color column or mark off the seventh space in the artefact or dice column &mdash; and you're the first player to do so &mdash; then you score a 20 point &quot;bridge bonus&quot; for being the first player to cross that bridge.&#10;&#10;If you mark off the ninth space in the dice column, you are considered to be &quot;exhausted&quot;, but you continue to play. The game ends after the turn in which all players are exhausted or all eight bridges have been crossed. Players then score points for each color column based on the number of spaces they've filled, doubling this score &mdash; whether positive or negative &mdash; if they've marked the &quot;double point&quot; circle at the bottom of the column. Players also score points for the number of spaces marked in the artefact and dice columns, but if you're exhausted, then you score 0 points for that column. Add your bridge bonus points to the sum of these eight columns, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player receives a 36 card deck, constructed from 3 each of 12 different ceremony cards (there are 16 different ceremonies in the base game).&#10;&#10;Each player has a player board with spaces for four ceremonies. Their play area consists of the four spaces of their board, and the two nearest spaces on their left and right neighbors (for a total of 8 spaces). On a turn, they may draw a card, start a ceremony on personal player board, as long as there is not a ceremony of that type on in their play area; or play a card from their hand into any ceremony in their play area. Once started, a ceremony in your player grants a special ability until it is completed.&#10;&#10;Ceremonies are complete after the fourth card is played to it, with the player claiming a victory point tile, and putting out a game end token if none is available. When all of the game end tokens have been put out the game ends. The player who has collected the most Victory Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, you'll set sail to various ports where cargo is known to get &quot;lost&quot; for the right price &ndash; Hong Kong, Bombay, Rotterdam, New York and more &ndash; and you'll make an offer for the goods on display. If another family then offers more in that port, you'll need to up your bid or take your money and slink away to look for goods elsewhere. Stand alone in a port, though, and you'll be able to discretely move the goods from the dock to your personal warehouse. Says Laget in a press release accompanying the game announcement, &quot;Everything in Cargo Noir grew from a core auction mechanism that is simple and trivial to explain &ndash; you can only bid up, and the last bidder standing gets the goods.&quot;&#10;&#10;Once you collect goods, you can trade them in to add more ships to your fleet &ndash; allowing you to scout for wares in more locations &ndash; purchase Victory Spoils, or take other actions. The more goods you collect, the more valuable they can be. The player with the most Spoils at game end wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the late 1840s, thousands of pioneers headed out West to seek wealth and opportunity. Many of these brave souls traveled by wagon over the Sierra Nevada mountain range, into what would soon become the Golden State of California. In the game Sierra West, you are an expedition leader who must guide a party of rough-and-ready pioneers&mdash;employing a clever mix of strategy and tactics with each step.&#10;&#10;Sierra West comes with four sets of special cards and parts, each of which can be combined with the game's basic components to create a unique mode of play. During setup, the players choose a mode, then build a mountain of overlapping cards with the corresponding deck. Each mode adds new thematic content, alternate paths to victory, and interesting twists on the core mechanics.&#10;&#10;The four included modules are:&#10;&#10;        Apple Hill&#10;        Gold Rush&#10;        Boats &amp; Banjos&#10;        Outlaws &amp; Outposts&#10;&#10;&#10;Overview of Play &#10;At the start of each turn, you will overlap and arrange three cards into your player board&mdash;exposing and concealing a selection of the action icons available on them. This will create two unique paths for your pioneers to follow. Next, you will move your pioneers across their paths from left to right, performing a series of small actions. Common actions include: claiming cards from the mountain, building cabins, gaining resources, and advancing your wagon. Additional actions are brought into the game by the chosen mode&mdash;such as: harvesting apples, mining for gold, fishing, and fighting outlaws. As your pioneers complete their paths, they will gain access to the action spaces on the upper portions of your cards. On these, you will be able to exchange resources for to advance on the wagon trail and homestead tracks, or activate other special abilities unique to the mode.&#10;&#10;As the game continues&mdash;and more cards are removed from the mountain&mdash;new and exciting things are discovered! Each piece of the mountain is either a card that can be gained to improve your deck, or a special card that is added to a face-up row at the mountain&rsquo;s base. As this row extends, more of the mode&rsquo;s opportunities and challenges come into play. For example, in Boats &amp; Banjos mode, the row is a river that offers more fishing and gold panning options as time goes on.&#10;&#10;Sierra West can be set up and played in under an hour, often leaving people with the desire to play it again right away&mdash;especially to explore the other modes! It is a highly thematic Eurogame that offers a truly novel and satisfying spin on action-programming, worker-placement, and deck-building.&#10;&#10;Includes solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Note: Contained inside the box are 2 promos for other games:&#10;Teotihuacan: City of Gods &#226;&#128;&#147; Sierra West Promo &#10;Dice Settlers: Sierra West Promo&#10;&#10;",

Can you foil Operation: Grand Slam and end Goldfinger&rsquo;s plot to contaminate the gold supply of the United States? Do you have the steely nerve to best Le Chiffre in the high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale? In this game the players are in control. The fate of the world is up to you. You can fight against the forces of evil by yourself or gather a cadre of up to four friends. Defeat the evil Masterminds as they lead powerful Villains in an attempt to complete their Schemes to gain power and world dominance!&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player starts with their own deck of basic starting cards. At the start of your turn, play the top card of the Villain Deck which allows Villains and Missions to enter &ldquo;On Assignment&rdquo;, acquire Gadgets, and wreak havoc on the players in other nefarious ways. Then play Hero cards from your hand to generate Attack, Recruit Points, and special abilities. You use Attack to defeat your enemies. You use Recruit Points to recruit more powerful Heroes from &ldquo;Q Branch&rdquo; for your deck. Whenever your deck runs out of cards, shuffle your discard pile to make a new deck, including all the new Heroes you recruited. This way your deck gets stronger and stronger over time. Build up enough  power, and you can defeat the Mastermind!

    "Description": "In Aqua Garden, you're the owner of an aquarium and want to stock its six tanks with a variety of sea life, but you have a limited amount of funds and only one employee on hand to place the fish in the tanks. Do your best to outshine the other aquariums in town!&#10;&#10;A game lasts 3-4 rounds depending on the number of players. You have your own aquarium board with six tanks, and a shared player board has sea creatures placed at random on its perimeter. Seaweed and coral tokens are placed on the separate sea board, along with five random sea creatures.&#10;&#10;During a round, whoever is farthest back on the perimeter of the shared board takes the next turn, moving their owner as many spaces as they want to an empty space, then taking the action of that space. If you stop on an advertising space, you receive funds based on what's currently in your tanks. If you stop on a sea creature space, you take them all, move your single employee 1-3 spaces clockwise on your aquarium board, then place the creatures in one or both tanks adjacent to the employee. (If the employee passes the feeding event card you were randomly dealt at the start of the game, then you receive funds from the bank based on how well the creatures in the two tanks next to the feeding event card match that card.)&#10;&#10;Each tank has only 4 units of oxygen available, so you can't add creatures to a tank that would consume more oxygen than this. You can add one seaweed to each tank, however, to increase the available oxygen to 6. You must also observe other placement restrictions, such as keeping sharks separate from fish and sea turtles. Additionally, you can pay to purchase creatures, seaweed, and coral from the sea board.&#10;&#10;If during your turn, the contents of one or more of your tanks matches one of the four randomized milestones on display, you mark the highest empty space on that milestone with a token. The first player to achieve each milestone receives a related creature that they can place in any tank.&#10;&#10;If you've circled the board, you wait for other players to finish, then start a new round, with players moving out in the order that they arrived. After the game ends, players score points for the milestones achieved, funds remaining, order in which they finished, and the sets of creatures they've collected in each tank.&#10;&#10;Aqua Garden includes manta rays, remoras, and flapjack octopuses that can be added to play to create new scoring opportunities.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Publisher:&#10;Tikal was discovered and explored during a very successful expedition led by Profs. Kramer and Kiesling. A decade later, a scroll is found that hints of a lost temple near the first site. This rumor rekindles their passion for Tikal and the two scientists start to discuss the prospect of another expedition to Central America. In the midst of their planning they encounter Profs. Braff and Pauchon at an international archaeology conference in Geneva, who want to know the truth about the enticing rumour.&#10;&#10;Later that day, sitting in front of a roaring fire after a fine meal finished off with Cuban cigars and a few brandies, the two Swiss scientists listen enthralled by the unfolding plans of their German colleagues. To a man they clamour their unanimous assent and it is decided to join forces and go back to Tikal. Appointments are made, patrons are found, equipment is assembled, notes are compared, and then they are off.&#10;&#10;An uneventful journey takes them to Guatemala, and then on to the old site. Not too long after, they discover that there is indeed an undisturbed temple in an adjacent valley. As it belonged to a long-forgotten king, the temple promises many surprises and much, much gold. And so the adventure begins...&#10;&#10;&#10;Tikal II: The Lost Temple is a sequel to 1999 Spiel des Jahres winner Tikal, from world-famous duo Kramer-Kiesling.&#10;&#10;Actions points have given way to two actions per turn :&#10;1) move part of your expedition around the board to choose an action tile, and then&#10;2) move your head scientist within the temple to explore new rooms and find gold.&#10;&#10;There are many ways to score. Collecting and delivering treasures is one, and having the majority in some rooms or exploring the main temple as well as an outer secret chamber, are others.&#10;&#10;Tikal II calls for careful planning, as your scientist can't move freely within the temple without specific items, and tension, as the actions around the board grow scarce. A game consists of two rounds, each concluded by a scoring. In the end, the player with the most gold is declared winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Red Dragon Inn 5: The Character Trove is a fast-paced, light-hearted card game for two or more players. You and your increasingly mighty party of adventuring companions have spent all day slogging through the dungeon, killing monsters and taking their stuff. Now you&rsquo;re back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the Red Dragon Inn. Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don&rsquo;t forget to keep an eye on your gold. If you run out, you&rsquo;ll have to spend the night in the stables. Oh&hellip; and try not to get too beaten up or too drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without you&hellip; after they loot your body for gold, of course! The last conscious adventurer with gold wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Red Dragon Inn 5: The Character Trove is a standalone game for 2-4 players. It expands on &quot;The Red Dragon Inn&quot; family of box sets and single-character expansions called Allies. You can mix and match characters from any of these sets, letting you build the party composition of your choice! Each of the box sets includes four unique characters, a drink deck, gold pieces, and all the parts for 2-4 players to play right out of the box. Each of the Allies expansions includes a character deck as well as gold pieces and bits so you can add another character to a box set (thus making a 2-4 player collection playable by 2-5 players).&#10;&#10;Sera the Fleetfooted: Sera is a stealthy rogue whose speed and agility allow her to take down roomfuls of bad guys before they even know what&rsquo;s happening. The dungeon&rsquo;s beefiest monsters are no match for her flying daggers! She didn&rsquo;t get so skilled by slacking off, though. Even while she&rsquo;s partying, she continues training to make sure she&rsquo;s always at the top of her game.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: She hones her skills by sparring with her friends.&#10;    The Bad: Sometimes she does this without warning them first&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;Lizwick the Collector: Lizwick is a consummate problem solver with an unrivaled collection of gear. Her wondrous Bag of Holding contains rare and peculiar items of all descriptions. She is always on the lookout for the next amazing whatchamacallit to add to her collection. Lizwick has gotten The Party out of many a jam with the clever application of the wrong tool at the right time.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Lizwick&rsquo;s collection is the envy of academies, guilds and hoarders alike!&#10;    The Bad: &hellip;and they&rsquo;d like their stuff back.&#10;&#10;&#10;Joran the Trickster: Joran&rsquo;s penchant for pranks earned him a student &ldquo;sabbatical&rdquo; from the Mage&rsquo;s Collegium. Fortunately, Zot saw some potential in the boy, and decided to take him adventuring for some valuable field experience. The young mage&rsquo;s humor has proven to be mostly harmless to his new friends. He puts his clever brain to good use by pulling fast ones on the bad guys.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Joran&rsquo;s talent for misdirection makes him the perfect weapon against enemy spell-casters.&#10;    The Bad: It also makes him the perfect weapon against his friends&rsquo; gold, their sobriety, their patience&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;Zakhan the Drunken Master: Zakhan&rsquo;s father is a solemn elven noble and a guru of meditative martial combat techniques. His mother was a rowdy barbarian warchief with a penchant for throwing wild parties. This unique heritage has allowed Zakhan to hone a seemingly reckless hybrid fighting style of his own. His opponents who underestimate his &ldquo;drunken&rdquo; martial arts do so at their own peril!&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Zakhan&rsquo;s drunken fighting techniques make him a formidable foe.&#10;    The Bad: Sometimes he&rsquo;s actually just drunk.&#10;&#10;&#10;But wait, there's more! The Red Dragon Inn 5: The Character Trove is also a massive storage solution for all previous sets (with room for more). You get a massive storage box plus dividers, new play mats for all previously released characters, updated tokens and more! Check it out:&#10;&#10;&#10;    6 Unique Decks (4 40-card Character Decks, 1 18-card Item Deck, 1 30-card Drink Deck)&#10;    29 Character-specific Player Mats (with replacements for all previous sets!)&#10;    35 Cardboard Deck Dividers&#10;    1 Cardboard Chi Marker&#10;    4 Glass Fortitude Markers&#10;    4 Glass Alcohol Content Markers&#10;    9 Remastered Cardboard Fortitude Markers&#10;    9 Remastered Cardboard Alcohol Content Markers&#10;    55 Remastered Gold Coin Tokens&#10;    9 New Platinum Coin Tokens&#10;    10 Foam Spacer Blocks&#10;    2 Cloth Drawstring Bags&#10;    Ziptop Baggies&#10;    Rules for playing The Red Dragon Inn&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But in the private salons of a luxury Bloomsbury hotel, the goal is something completely different. The fifty greatest known mediums are taking part in a never-before-seen tournament in order to determine which one is the most powerful of all. The final table opens in a few minutes and you will be joining it. Who will win the &pound;1,000 reserved for the winner?&#10;&#10;In Divinare &mdash; pronounced &quot;di-vin-AH-ray&quot;, with the stress on the penultimate syllable &mdash; the players play the part of famous mediums who must attempt to divine the cards held by their opponents. In each round, only two-thirds of the cards &mdash; representing the four divination methods of chiromancy, crystallomancy, tasseomancy and astromancy &mdash; are dealt out, and are then revealed little-by-little, giving the players the possibility of narrowing their predictions. A good prediction will allow the players to win points, but guess wrong and you may be forced to take a penalty. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

When a city is completed, all players score points for &quot;guild cards&quot; they play, with the right timing in playing the right card making all the difference.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player first establishes a new wall somewhere on the board. Each wall will be enclosed by two towers, and will have one house placed on each side of it. It's possible for a wall to need only one, or zero, new towers by putting it next to existing towers. It's possible for only one house to be placed, if the wall is placed along the outside of the game board.&#10;After placing the wall, the player rolls three dice to determine the color of one of the towers (the color of a possible second tower may be freely chosen), and that of the two houses (if only one house is placed, then the player may choose which of the dice to pick for the color of the house).&#10;Finally, if the newly placed wall causes a piece of land to be fully enclosed, a new city has been established. If the new city borders one or more existing cities, it may be combined with one of those cities. Two houses of the same color inside the city are upgraded to a palace. A scoring round is now triggered, during which all players get to play one or two &quot;guild cards&quot;, and then draw one new card. Each guild card will score a feature of either the just completed city, or outside it. Possible features are the number of houses &amp; palaces or towers of a specified color, the number of fields of the city, the number of houses inside a &quot;district&quot; on the board, the number of palaces inside a city, the different number of colors inside a city, or the total number of completed cities. At the end of a scoring round, whichever player is in last place may discard as many guild cards as desired, and draw new ones to replace them.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all pieces of a certain type have been played, and the winner is whoever has the most points.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played out in three phases: Adventure, Journey, and Port. These phases are games in and of themselves with mechanisms and components of their own. There are also many RPG elements.&#10;&#10;&mdash;During the Adventure phase, you explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, abandoned temples, and pillage colonial villas. You will come up against treacherous red coats and their officers and cross swords with conquistador skeletons, all while trying to evade curses from Mayan mummies. And don't forget the mighty darkclaw and his abominations ruled by Yemaya, Goddess of the Sea. Amazing treasures and legendary artefacts that no man has ever laid eyes on await you in the phase of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;In the Journey Phase, you form part of the crew of &quot;The Southern Lady&quot; sailing the menacing seas of the Caribbean in search of valuable treasures. You will board ships and face all kinds of dangers like the most-feared creatures of the seven seas. Make sure you win the trust of your fellow crewmates so that when it comes time to mutiny, you can take on the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges...&#10;&#10;&mdash;Finally, you have the chance to rest and spend your booty during the Port Phase. Upon your arrival to Tortuga, you will be able to visit the cantina, listen to rumors, and tell great stories about your feats that will turn you into a legendary pirate. You can also visit Madame Claude's Mansion and be treated like a noble. Perhaps, though, you prefer to go to the market to buy that sword that'll come in handy for your next adventure. And, of course, if you go down to the docks you can take on some assignments for the Captain who is always willing to earn a few extra doubloons selling contraband. For those troubled souls in search of a cure for some curse or wound, there is the Chapel. But watch out! The streets of Tortuga can be dangerous and you never know what surprises they might have in store for you.

Dichas fases son juegos en si mismos, tanto por mec&aacute;nica como por sus diferentes componentes. Es un juego que tiene mucho de RPG:&#10;&#10;- En la Fase de Aventura vas a explorar misteriosas islas, peligrosas cuevas, templos abandonados o saquear villas coloniales. Te enfrentar&aacute;s a los peligrosos casacas rojas y sus oficiales; cruzar&aacute;s tu espada con los esqueletos conquistadores, mientras evitas los hechizos de las momias mayas; combatir al poderoso pinzaoscura y sus abominaciones del mar, dominados por Yemay&aacute;, la diosa del mar. Te aguardan asombrosos tesoros y legendarios artefactos que jam&aacute;s han visto los ojos de ning&uacute;n hombre.&#10;&#10;- Durante la Fase de Traves&iacute;a, formar&aacute;s parte de la tripulaci&oacute;n de &quot;La Dama del Sur&quot;, navegando por las amenazadoras aguas del Caribe, en busca de valiosas mercanc&iacute;as, abordando nav&iacute;os, enfrent&aacute;ndote a todo tipo de peligros del mar, y evitando a las bestias m&aacute;s temidas de todos los oc&eacute;anos.

Quiz&aacute;s, prefieras acudir al mercado para comprar esa espada tan necesaria para tus incursiones, o esos mejunjes que pueden salvarte la vida en tu siguiente aventura. Sin olvidar que en los muelles aguardan los encargos para el Capit&aacute;n, que siempre est&aacute; dispuesto a ganarse algunos doblones extras cuando se trata de llevar a cabo alg&uacute;n contrabando.

    "Description": "Game description from the designer:&#10;&#10;Commands &amp; Colors: Medieval is based on the Commands &amp; Colors game system and by design is not overly complex. The Medieval game introduces many new game concepts to the Commands &amp; Colors system, which add historical depth and flavor. Some of the new concepts are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Superior armor and status when battling&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cavalry units increase to 4 blocks&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Heavy infantry battle dice are reduced from 5 dice down to 4&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Light Bow Cavalry units can employ the Parthian Shot when they evade&#10;&#10;&#10;Still, some Commands &amp; Colors game mechanics remain familiar to players of other games in the system, like the deck of Medieval Command cards that drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war,&rdquo; and the battle dice that will resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The stylized battlefield scenario maps emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The scale of the game is flexible, and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a unit may represent a Chiliarchy of soldiers, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. The battlefield tactics, however, that you will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various medieval unit types, their weapons, the terrain, and history.&#10;&#10;The medieval battles showcased in the scenario book focus on the historical confrontations between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persians (530 to 627 AD) with a slight detour to battle the Moors and their rebel allies (645 - 648 AD). The Byzantine Empire during this period of medieval history was one of constant transition and reorganization. Its army tended to mirror its eastern adversaries by deploying an increasing number of armored cavalry formations (Cataphracts) and more missile troops. Yet, it was how the Byzantines adapted their battlefield tactics in relation to the enemy it faced that is perhaps the chief reason for the longevity of their Empire.&#10;&#10;Although the Byzantine army fought on other frontiers, against a multitude of opponents, Visigoths, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alemanni, those conflicts are beyond the scope and space of this one package. Additional expansion modules that address those battles will be forthcoming.&#10;&#10;",

Build cities, monuments and other structures, open new trade routes, expand and fight off outsiders out of your land, plan your actions with your clan council, research and issue decrees so your actions will be more powerful than your opponents! You have only 4 rounds to prove you are worthy of the legendary Minos title.&#10;&#10;Draft and assign the dice to the programming board. With lower value dice you can secure stronger actions but the higher value dice will help you climb on the tracks and gain their benefits. During the action phase each player takes their dice in order from highest to lowest and performing the pre-planned actions. Players also build their tableau - each card has an instant effect and a triggered reward connected to the specific action or die value they can use to make the action more powerful.

    "Description": "Northern Pacific is a luck-free railroad-building game that lasts about twenty minutes. This game is in the genre of Iron Road / TransAmerica and SNCF / Paris Connection.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with one large investment cube and three small investment cubes in hand. The game board shows the United States from Minnesota to Washington; game play starts in Minneapolis/St. Paul. On a turn, a player either places one of their cubes in a city (other than Seattle) that hasn't yet been reached by the train or builds track. If they build track, they choose one of the railroad lines exiting the city where the train is currently located and place a locomotive on it to show the current endpoint of the railroad line. Track has directional arrows on it, and a new train line can never move against the arrows or back to a city that the railroad has already visited.&#10;&#10;When the railroad visits a city where players have placed investment cubes, they retrieve those cubes and take additional cubes from the supply: one new cube if they had a small cube in the city and two new cubes if they had a large cube.&#10;&#10;When the railroad reaches Seattle, the round ends. Players tally the number of cubes in hand and records this number on the &quot;good investments&quot; track; they record the number of their cubes still on the game board on the &quot;bad investments&quot; track. They then reset the board as at the start of the game, then begin a new round. After three rounds, whoever has made the most good investments wins; if players are tied, then the tied player who has made the fewest bad investments wins.&#10;&#10;You can play a single round of the game to determine a winner, if desired, or you can play new rounds with no recorded score, with a player winning the game if they win two rounds.&#10;&#10;Note that the Winsome version of Northern Pacific is for 3-6 players, whereas the Rio Grande Games version is for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;",

Do that, and you win the game instantly.&#10;&#10;In detail, Sonar includes four pairs of maps, and each team takes the same maps in their color. A team can be one or two players, and with two players on a team, each player takes a different role: Captain or Radio Operator. (A one-person team handles both roles.) A divider separates the teams, and each Captain marks their starting location on the map.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the Captain calls out an action, typically moving their sub one space north, south, east, or west. When they do this, they call out a direction, mark their new location, and add one energy to their ship's register. The Radio Operator on the other team notes the movement of this sub on a plastic sheet, and through deduction and trial-and-error tries to determine exactly where the opposing sub might be on the map.&#10;&#10;Instead of moving, a Captain can also:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Use sonar: Erase two energy from your register; the opposing team must reveal their row or column.&#10;    Go silent: Erase three energy from your register; move your sub, but don't gain energy and don't tell the opponents which direction you're moving.&#10;    Fire a torpedo: Erase four energy from your register; call out coordinates in your quadrant (e.g., F6); if the opponents are on that space, they take a point of damage.&#10;    Surface: Announce your location to the opposing team, then erase your previous path on your map; you can't cross your own path during the game, so sometimes you need to surface in order not to box yourself in.&#10;&#10;&#10;You can have at most four energy in reserve, so you need to manage movement and the other actions carefully so that you'll be able to fire at the opponents once you know where they are &mdash; ideally without being torpedoed in response!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the second third of the 19th century, a rapid development of railway transport got under way. All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.&#10; First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).&#10;&#10;With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so. Some slight changes of the original rules work with that map as well as the rules of the first edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on Wolfgang Kramer's earlier effort Wildlife Adventure, Expedition &mdash; which is on the market as Expeditions: Around the World since 2023 &mdash; is a game about moving three commonly held expeditions around the world in search of various archaeological sites. The board shows a map of the world with many different branching paths, and players advance the expeditions by placing plastic arrows. When an expedition arrives at a location that matches one of your private site cards or one of the public site cards, you score that card. Certain spaces on the board allow you to play again immediately, and other spaces allow you to pick up a bonus action card that you can play at any time on one of your turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has scored all of their cards, then whoever has the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Thrill to the dust of chariot races, or the skillful bloodshed of gladiatorial combat. Circus Maximus is really TWO games in one. In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;Battleline&#039;s Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by The Avalon Hill Game Co as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator.&#10;&#10;Violent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining bidding cards and reveal them simultaneously.  For positive prizes, the highest card gets the prize; For negative prizes, the lowest card is stuck with the prize.  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line.

In the building phase, players decide on the height of the buildings and build them at the side of the board; if they have the necessary permit, they can build on the board itself. A building is finished when it has a roof; the first roof in a prefecture determines the shape of all other roofs. In the auction phase players can auction for temples, wells and amphitheaters, earning extra points. This is a beautiful production.&#10;&#10;This game by Alan R. Moon and Aaron Weissblum is a mix of territory acquisition, resource management and even a little auctioning thrown in for good measure.

It includes 72 tiles, consisting of 63 tiles released in the original base game, 6 from Inns &amp; Cathedrals, 1 from Traders &amp; Builders and 2 from King &amp; Scout. It also includes a special replacement start tile which depicts the Wheel of Fortune, a new mechanic unique to this edition of the game. The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4&times;4 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.&#10;&#10;Nineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.&#10;&#10;Play of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game. This game can also be played with the base game as an expansion, using its wagon wheel watermark to differentiate it from the base game.&#10;&#10;The German edition of this game includes a book Carcassonne -&nbsp;Das Schicksalsrad by Helene Luise K&ouml;ppel.&#10;&#10;The English edition of the game was released in October 2009 by Rio Grande Games.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;",

Arkham Police, in deference to your unusual expertise, have asked for your help to get to the root of the matter. Time is of the essence because after Walpurgis Night, the trail will grow cold and the culprits will retreat to the shadows until the next Witches' Sabbat, when the next cycle of deaths will begin.&#10;&#10;As private investigator Howard Lovecraft, you will investigate events based on the stories &quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; (1933), &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Unnamable&quot; (1923).&#10;&#10;Arkham Noir is a solitaire card game inspired by the interconnected stories of H. P. Lovecraft and other authors, re-imagined as noir detective stories. Each case stands alone.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of adding cards to open cases, creating lines of investigation in an effort to solve them. The ultimate goal is to score five &quot;puzzle&quot; clue cards in order to piece together the big picture before running out of time or mental stability. Each newly shuffled deck is the start of a unique challenge, with adjustable difficulty levels to accommodate all level of players.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Como cada a&ntilde;o en la ciudad embrujada de Arkham, la noche de Walpurgis, en las v&iacute;speras del 1 de mayo, trae consigo malos augurios, desapariciones y sucesos inexplicables.

Una vez m&aacute;s, la polic&iacute;a de Arkham reclama tu inusual experiencia para llegar a la ra&iacute;z de los hechos. Debes actuar con rapidez antes de que las huellas del culto se desvanezcan y los culpables vuelvan a ocultarse entre las sombras, donde permanecer&aacute;n hasta el Sabbat de las brujas, cuando comenzar&aacute; un nuevo ciclo de muertes.&#10;&#10;Ponte en la piel del investigador privado Howard Lovecraft e indaga los sucesos basados en los relatos: &ldquo;Los sue&ntilde;os en la casa de la bruja&rdquo; (1933), &ldquo;El que acecha en el umbral&rdquo; (1933) y &ldquo;Lo innombrable&rdquo; (1923).&#10;&#10;Arkham Noir es un juego inspirado en la interconexi&oacute;n de relatos de H. P. Lovecraft y otros autores, reinventados como historias detectivescas de novela negra. Cada caso de la serie Arkham Noir es independiente y se juega en solitario. El juego consiste en ir a&ntilde;adiendo cartas de pista a las l&iacute;neas de investigaci&oacute;n de los diferentes casos abiertos con el prop&oacute;sito de resolverlos. El objetivo final es recabar 5 tipos de pista diferentes con el atributo Puzle, que al unirlas nos proporcionen la perspectiva general de los sucesos acontecidos, cuidando de que no se acabe el tiempo o perdamos la cordura.&#10;&#10;Cada volumen de la serie nos enfrentar&aacute; a un reto &uacute;nico, con grados de dificultad adaptables para cualquier tipo de jugador.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, only one player receives three of the total five clues. From the actions of the other players (caravan leaders), the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated, in order to save all the goods from the thieves.&#10;&#10;The next morning, the caravan continues its way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again.

To get the highest score, players must ensure that on each path the animals can collect their favorite food.&#10;&#10;Foxes, hedgehogs, beavers, owls, rabbits, woodpeckers, wild cats... Up to 23 different types of animals live together in the Savernake Forest. At the end of autumn, they all prepare to spend the cold winter with enough provisions and here you are to give them a hand&hellip; Or a paw! To play Savernake Forest you have two decks of square cards, one showing the animals and the other with forest paths full of succulent food. Each player is randomly given an animal card, showing how many foods they can store and their preferences. For example, the fox loves eggs, but not berries or nuts. To get the best score, you must try to get each animal to collect its favorite foods.&#10;&#10;During setup, three road cards and one animal card are laid out for all players to see. Each player, on his turn, will choose one of them and add it to his forest, always respecting three rules: there can never be two animals on the same path; cards must be adjacent and no cards can be placed outside of a 4x4 grid. The game ends when all participants have completed their forest, with a total of 16 cards.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will have the help of some animals, depending on the card they choose from the central market. The rooster will help you get up early, so you can be the first to choose a card in the next turn. The armadillo teaches you how to dig better shelters to store more food, so you can take a burrow token and add it to one of your animal cards to increase that animal's storage capacity by 1. The goat teaches you to hydrate yourself better, offering a water drop token that can be associated with a food and increase its value by 1. Finally, the rabbit helps you attract new animals to your forest.&#10;&#10;For players looking for more advanced challenges, the rulebook includes a two-player variant with some modifications that increase the difficulty. Quite a boost if you already master the basic rules!&#10;&#10;With a dreamy art, Savernake Forest offers a perfect balance between fun and strategy that makes it perfect for any type of playgroup. Family and friends will have a great time helping the animals of the forest, while trying to make the most of their paths to reach the highest score. Stroll through Savernake in the fall and be swept away by the enchantment of its wildlife!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In battle, there are no equals.&#10;&#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh&auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.&#10;&#10;All the world's a stage in Unmatched: Slings and Arrows, while the Globe Theater is a battlefield. William Shakespeare steps up to the fight along with three of his wondrous characters: The Wayward Sisters, Hamlet, and Titania. Shakespeare's deck, designed by Jonathan Guberman, was one of the winning decks in a 2020 design competition, and it rewards players for completing lines in iambic pentameter. The Wayward Sisters, a runner-up in that competition from Jason Hager, is a multi-hero deck that challenges you to bring the witches' potion machinations to life with cunning co-ordination.&#10;&#10;",

Puzzle Strike is a complete game in a box that has the fun of a customizable card game without the marketing scheme of selling you parts of the game in random packs. You build your deck *as* you play the game. Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each game. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game.&#10;&#10;A built-in comeback mechanic means that when you're on the edge of losing, you're also able to do even more combos than usual.&#10;&#10;Shuffling cards takes too long and is boring, so in Puzzle Strike you just put your cardboard tokens in a bag and shake them up to shuffle! Plus, it&rsquo;s pretty ballin&rsquo; to play a game with chips.

Each player has an identical set of pieces in a unique color. The goal is to get rid of all of your pieces by placing them on the hexagonal game board. Each piece that you place after the first cannot touch previously-placed pieces of the same color; instead each piece must be a distance of &quot;1&quot; from another piece of the same color, where 1 is the length of a side of one of the small hexagons. Another restriction is that the distance being measured can't directly cross another player's piece, but it can lie at the junction of two pieces. Once all players have placed as many pieces as they can, they count the number of hexagonal units in the pieces they couldn't place, and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Gemblo supports up to six players. In the two-player version of the game, each player uses two colors of pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns doing the following: On a turn, a player rolls all of their dice not already on cards, then places any dice that match the targets on the corresponding cards. (Alternatively, before taking her turn, a player can first choose to reclaim all of their dice from all cards.)&#10;&#10;If the player now fulfills the target with their dice &ndash; e.g., a pair of 3s, a quartet of 6s, or a specific combination of numbers &ndash; they claims the card, takes back their dice (and returns any other dice on the card to their owner), then places a new card on the table. Each card is worth a certain number of points. The first player to earn forty or more points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On the cusp of the twentieth century, America is the undisputed land of industry. Factories fire their machines twenty-four hours a day, and demand is skyrocketing in the cities. A small but fierce rivalry of shipping barons must manage their amazing airships and the extensive railroad system in order to get goods to the cities before the demand is met by someone else. Anyone who can't stay competitive will be left with nothing but dust in their coffers!&#10;&#10;The process is simple: Factories produce the goods (machinery, textiles, chemicals, food, and luxuries) that are coveted by the city folk.  Airships &ndash; forbidden from landing in the cities but capable of carrying cargo over great distances &ndash; must be used to gather those goods and deliver them to depots along the rail network. Trains then haul the goods to the cities that want them, earning cash for the competitor who gets there first! Will you be the &quot;King of Air and Steam?&quot;&#10;&#10;Kings of Air and Steam spans five rounds, and at the beginning of each round, players plan their Airship flights using four of their movement cards. When everyone is ready, everyone reveals their first planned card. According to the turn order and movement limits of their cards, players move their Airships, then take an Action; Actions include Building Depots, Upgrading your Airship or Train, Shipping Goods by rail, and Soliciting Funds from the bank. When all players have acted, the second planned cards are revealed, and so on through the four planned cards until all players have finished carrying out their plans for the round. All the while, players must keep aware of the rising values of the different types of Goods and try to get the most-valuable Goods from the specialized factories that produce them to the cities that want them. At the end of the game, the player with the most money and the greatest shipping network will be declared King of Air and Steam!&#10;&#10;Kings of Air and Steam includes seven teams of characters, each with unique powers to give them a competitive edge, and a modular game board that makes each game a different experience.&#10;&#10;",

Much gambolling, some tupping, lots of shearing.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;&quot;'The Best Game Ewe Ever Herd!'&#10;&#10;Ah, do ewe long for the life of a sheep? Bright summer days filled with games of tag and attempts to flock closer to Roger, the Heartthrob Ram? But, Watch Out! The shearer wants to drag you away from all the fun and games!&#10;&#10;In Shear Panic, ewe maneuver your ewes to score points, playing tag, standing close to Roger, or trying to avoid the shearing scissors! Will your brave sheep score the most points, or will it be &quot;Off with the wool&quot; for ewe?&quot;&#10;&#10;The game includes eleven small figurines (which are somewhat fragile): Two each of four different colors, one black, one 'Roger', and one 'Shearer'. Also included are four player mats in different colors; a timing/scoring mat; 48 mutton buttons in four colors; four scoring markers; one flock marker; and two special six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;There are two separate play areas: The one where the flock of sheep figurines are clustered; and the combination timing/scoring mat. (The timing mat is two-sided for 3 or 4 players.) Actions by the players each turn cause the timing marker to move faster or slower through each of the four fields, and the scoring is different in each field.&#10;&#10;Field 1 is Team Tag. Players score higher for keeping their sheep closer together. Field 2 is Roger&rsquo;s Field, where players score more the closer they are to Roger (the ram). Field 3 is Black Sheep Tag, and players score higher the closer they are to the black sheep. Field 4 is the Shear Panic Field, and the row of sheep closest to the shearer figure are eliminated each turn, while the remainder are scored individually. The timing marker indicates which Field the sheep are currently &ldquo;in&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Players have a total of twelve actions they may take during the course of the game, and as each one is used, a &ldquo;mutton button&rdquo; is placed over it, eliminating it from future use. Also, the more powerful the action, the farther (faster) the timing marker will move. If the timing marker lands on a red spot, the active player executes a free &ldquo;lamb slam&rdquo; by rolling the Panic Die and moving a sheep of the color rolled one space in any direction. If the Panic Die rolls white, the entire flock does a &ldquo;ewe turn&rdquo; ninety degrees in a direction of the active player&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Since all the player mats are visible to everyone, players need to keep an eye on what moves are still available to their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is intended for three or four players, but rules for a two-player variant are included.&#10;&#10;Starting player is the person who most recently was sheared (had their hair cut).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Long before the threat of the Nemesis, before the perils of warp drive or the founding of our own Space Academy, humanity experienced a Golden Age of space exploration. The mineral riches of the thriving Moon colony inspired legions of hearty Earth citizens to seek their fortunes in space. Humble rockets probed the farthest reaches of the solar system in an eager quest for resources, and brave colonists forged homes wherever they could survive. Pioneer life was hard, but the men and women who worked and raised their families on those planets and asteroids had much to be proud of.&#10;&#10;Then the rumors began &mdash; whispered tales of frontier abductions and sightings of mysterious creatures. By the time the secret invasion was exposed, the aliens were everywhere. Families had been stolen away by slavers from the stars, and the peace-loving survivors had no choice but to arm themselves and fight. Fight to stop the alien attacks! Fight to free the helpless abductees! Fight to throw the aggressors back into space and end forever their power to threaten humanity!&#10;&#10;Thus was born the Rocket Patrol &ndash; an organization of brave and hearty women and men dedicated to defending humanity and taking the fight to the alien menace from the stars.&#10;&#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions is a cooperative, scenario-based, tactical action game for 1-6 players, which is set in the Golden Age of science fiction. In this game, the third standalone title in the Space Cadets franchise of cooperative/team space-themed games from Stronghold Games, players take on the roles of adventurous human spacemen who explore UFOs, acquire Alien technology and fight hostile extraterrestrials.&#10;&#10;Each turn, spacemen have three action points to spend on activities such as firing their atomic rifles, analyzing exotic equipment, or subduing the malicious Brain-in-a-Jar. When the spacemen are finished, the aliens take their turns by following simple movement and combat protocols; seven types of hostile aliens threaten the players, from the repulsive mind leeches to the rampaging titanic sentinels.&#10;&#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions contains twenty scenarios linked in a campaign story. Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.&#10;&#10;",

Players need to banish monsters and collect items in order to seal the eight gates before time on the doom-tracker runs out and the Great Old One awakens.&#10;&#10;The gameplay follows three steps in a fixed order: bringing new creatures in the game, the player actions and drawing an event card.&#10;The game can be won by succesfully by completing different goals: find out the active Great Old One, seal all eight gates and send a player with the right combination of items to the Great Old One to banish him.&#10;Losing the game can be done in three different ways: the doom track runs out, the players fail to reveal the Great Old One in time or the players all go insane.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Step back to early 20th Century New England. Here, the horrible &quot;Great Old Ones&quot; mysterious inhabitants of a dark, unfathomable void-seek entry into our world. One of their imprisoned overlords gathers them, just as his worldly servants open portals throughout Arkham for the coming onslaught. Only Salem's master witch, Robert Craven, holds the key to safeguarding mankind. He plans to gather a team of intrepid scholars to find the hidden portals and close them with powerful magic seals. The noble witch's elite team must battle the threat of madness, duel the dark servants, tackle mystical challenges, and face their ultimate nemesis: an unidentified Great Old One with an unknown and incalculable strength.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Witch of Salem,&quot; you step into the terrifying world of renowned storyteller Wolfgang Hohlbein, a mythos inspired by the tales of H.

The players lay a card from their hand to a 5x5 grid after nut tokens (points) are laid out for each row and column.&#10;&#10;When the grid is full of cards, the rows and columns are checked. The color with the highest total in a line takes the nut token for that bird. Colors with tied totals are ignored, so a low value card can win the nut token for that bird.&#10;&#10;When the nuts are totaled up for the birds, the players reveal their final hand card. That card is the bird they favored (so more than one player might be helping the same bird), and for each player, the number on the card is added to the nut total to identify who has the dominant bird.&#10;&#10;Since the players choose which bird they favor by leaving it as their final hand card, they can delay this choice until they see how the game is panning out.&#10;&#10;The game rules for the Japanese version, Birdie Fight, come in Japanese and English with the game itself being language free. The Songbirds version of the game is entirely in English. The game includes rules for 2-4 players or a solitaire/co-op mode for 1-2 players.&#10;&#10;Japanese version publisher's summary&#10;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#162;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;5&times;5&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#169;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#168;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#156;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#174;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#231;&#185;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#191;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#139;&#177;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#232;&#170;&#172;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pixie Queen is a smoothly playing worker-placement game about a pixie queen who rules over her subordinates like a true tyrant. The legend tells of pixies being small, flying, naughty creatures often spotted in the area of Cornwall and Devon in the UK. Apart from the stealing, bullying and torturing, they are considered a big nuisance to the human inhabitants of the region. According to the game, they are obliged to do so by their pixie queen...&#10;&#10;The player with the fewest points wins since the only points one can earn (or avoid) during the game are penalty points. Reward points are given out only at the end of the game, and you can receive rewards by charming the Queen with a golden ring, making additional offerings during the game, or promoting your pixies to faithful servants of the Queen. Obtaining each reward demands completely different game tactics.&#10;&#10;In summary, the game consists of a maximum of seven rounds with five phases each:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Steal food (honey, apples, bread) in Truro, the nearest human village.&#10;     Perform actions with your four action disks to maximize your profits and gain more goods. There is a choice of no less than 21 different actions. For most actions, two action disks are needed unless you can enlist the help of a pixie.&#10;     Offer simultaneously with all other players gold, silver or food to the Queen. She only accepts the food for which she has a craving in this round.&#10;     Receive possible rewards: Promote pixies to become a faithful servant or get a better trading position to obtain gold or golden rings.&#10;    Penalty points are given to the pixies that didn&rsquo;t achieve enough according to the Queen.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Deck-Building Game, you take on the role of Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn or one of their brave and heroic allies in the struggle against the forces of the Dark Lord Sauron! While you begin armed only with basic combat maneuvers, you will add new, more powerful cards to your deck as you go, with the goal of defeating the deadly forces that serve Sauron as you make your way towards Mount Doom. In the end, the player who has accumulated the most victory points (VPs) from the cards in his deck wins.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of one of seven iconic heroes from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring: Aragorn, Frodo, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Samwise, and Boromir. Each hero comes with a special power unique to that character and usable only by that player.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into a well-oiled machine. There are five different types of cards that can be acquired: Enemies, Allies, Artifacts, Manuevers, and Locations.&#10;&#10;To bolster their existing deck of cards, players use Power to acquire cards from &quot;The Path&quot;, a large, central stack of cards that supplies a five-card line-up from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five face-up cards from which to choose each turn, so every turn there are new options and surprises.&#10;&#10;When a player has amassed enough Power, he or she may defeat more powerful enemies from the &quot;Archenemy&quot; deck. &quot;Archenemy&quot; cards are represented  by the notable enemies from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, including Saruman, and the Balrog, among others. When an &quot;Archenemy&quot; is defeated, a new one appears and makes an Attack against each player in the game! Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Boromir's Shield, Mithril Armor, &quot;You Shall Not Pass!&quot; and several others.&#10;&#10;The objective for each player is to acquire the most VPs by the end of the game. Nearly every card acquired during the game has a VP value, with the &quot;Archenemy&quot; cards providing the most VPs. In the end, the player who has accumulated the most VPs from the cards in his deck wins.&#10;&#10;Cryptozoic's The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit deck-builder series:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Deck-Building Game Expansion Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",
