    "Description": "Asami has experienced more pain in her relatively few years than most people are capable of enduring in a lifetime. As a child, she saw faint lights which she knew came from Beyond. To guard her from judgment, her father kept her isolated. Asami grew lonely and yearned for the day she would have a family of her own.&#10;&#10;Following an attack on her family shrine, she lost not only her father but also her fertility, and with it, the hope of creating her own family. Mortally wounded, Asami let the Amanjaku inside her soul, bestowing her with the bestial power of the oni &ndash; power which escalated as she let the demon even deeper within her, lured on by its promise to grant her a child. The exchange was a dark pact; the ravenous maw splitting the back of her head is both a constant reminder of her own insatiable hunger for the life she lost and the cruel mark of her oni manipulator.&#10;&#10;The Ten Thunders have recruited Asami into their number, hoping to use her demonic strength for themselves, but whether they will be able to control her is another matter entirely.&#10;&#10;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing six 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic, Stat Cards and Upgrade Cards. Will require some preparation and assembly.&#10;&#10;Set Contains:&#10;&#10;Models&#10;&#10;Asami Tanaka&#10;    Amanjaku&#10;    Ohaguro Bettari&#10;    3 Yokai&#10;&#10;Stat Cards&#10;&#10;Asami Tanaka&#10;    Amanjaku&#10;    Ohaguro Bettari&#10;    3 Yokai&#10;&#10;",

Pick up a card and then play a card, if you have two matching cards then play the two. Once you play a card it is known as a sold card. You collect the sell value and the first player to reach 4,000G's is the winner, simple right? However everything changes because every single turn you also turn over an Action card. This is where the fun really starts! Will it be the cops busting you? A hydroponics upgrade for increased weed sell value, that sees players bidding against each other. Or the arrival of a rival gang that forces players to cooperate. Tinz Herbalist is pure fun in a tin!&#10;&#10;",

Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.&#10;&#10;Mega Man Pixel Tactics: Frost Man is a new character  that is compatible with all other Pixel Tactics games.&#10;&#10;This was a reward for backing Game Boy Geek - Season 5 (2017) on Kickstarter. &#10;Two copies of the card were included - one with a red back; the other with a blue back while the fronts are identical&#10;&#10;",

Deal each player 6 cards and put the remaining cards face down in a draw pile. EACH PLAYER WILL ALWAYS KEEP 6 CARDS IN THEIR HAND.&#10;&#10;Game Play: Player 1 draws a card and makes a decision to either (1) put down a point card face up to add towards the 100-point goal OR (2) put down a PENALTY Death by Cantaloupe card on another player OR (3) discard and play nothing. Player 1 will still have 6 cards in hand when turn is over and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn to draw a card and play.  At the end of each turn, the player will always have 6 cards in their hand.  The first player to have EXACTLY 100-points face up in front of them wins.  If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile and turn over to start a new draw pile.&#10;&#10;Exception to Drawing a Card: If a player has a PENALTY Death by Cantaloupe card played on them, the combination of fruit cards MUST be placed down (one turn at a time) to clear the penalty.  The fruit combination can be from the player&rsquo;s hand of cards or from their existing points pile (therefore reducing their point total).  IF A FRUIT CARD IS MOVED FROM THE FACE UP POINT TOTAL IN FRONT OF A PLAYER, THEY DO NOT DRAW A CARD AND THEIR TURN IS OVER.  The player still has 6 cards in their hand.&#10;Death by Cantaloupe PENALTY: There are 6 penalty cards that have 2-fruit combinations and 6 penalty cards that have 3-fruit combinations.  Penalty cards must be face up with each card that clears it next to it.  When the penalty is cleared all cards go into the discard pile.  Only 1 card per turn can be played and NO point cards toward the 100-point goal can be played by the penalized player until the penalty is cleared.&#10;Crazy Coconut: The Crazy Coconut instantly wipes out a penalty cantaloupe card.  The Death by Cantaloupe card and the Crazy Coconut cards (and any point cards already put down towards the penalty) go into the discard pile.  The player will still have 6 cards in their hand when turn is over.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You&rsquo;re at the controls of a six-story combat Mech! But will it be enough to save Neo Tokyo from the giant Monsters?&#10;&#10;In this cooperative board game for up to five players, you build a Mech out of unique parts to create a deadly combat machine! Then take the controls and head into Neo Tokyo to battle Giant Monsters &ndash; but watch out for the citizens caught in the crossfire.&#10;&#10;Featuring five-player cooperative battles, you and your friends will work to create the most effective Mechs you can from the parts you have on hand, then defend Neo Tokyo from the gigantic horrors that attack it. If you can work together with your teammates, choose the best strategy, and effectively manage your Mech&rsquo;s power supply and repairs, Neo Tokyo may just survive. If you can&rsquo;t, then it&rsquo;s Game Over, man.&#10;&#10;---------Game Overview-----------&#10;Players build their Mechs using the three types of parts (Chassis, Arms, Legs).  Each part has a Tile and a set of cards associated with it. The tiles are combined to form the Mech while the cards are assembled to form the player's Command Deck.&#10;Several Monsters are then placed onto the board which represents the city of Neo Tokyo. Citizen cards are also added to the city, and represent the people in Neo Tokyo that the players must defend.&#10;The Monsters then attack, using an Event Deck which indicates which of the two attacked printed on the Monster Stat cards the Monster will resolve. If the Monster in alone in its City Space, it generally attacks the Citizens and the City itself. If there is a Mech in the space with it, a Monster will attack the Mech instead. This is important because when the Monsters destroy a City space or enough Citizens, the destruction track is raised. If the Destruction Track reaches the final space, the players lose the game!&#10;After the Monsters attack, the players will then use their Command Cards or Tile Actions to engage the Monsters, usually generating a random amount of damage that is applied to the Monster.  Each attack raises a Monster Attack Track, which triggers another Monster Attack Phase when filled. &#10;Once the Monsters are all defeated, the Boss Monster appears. This is a bigger and tougher Monster that the players must defeat in order to win.  &#10;If they can do this before the Destruction Track is filled, they successfully Defend Neo Tokyo&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mammoth herd is passing by close to your village. You can tame these mammoths in order to have their help when constructing your village. But hurry up! Other tribes are on their way as well!&#10;&#10;You can combine this mini expansion with the basic game as well as with all other expansions. First, you set up the game as usual. You shuffle all 16 bonus tiles and place them face down next to the game board. The stand-up figure Mammoth herd is placed next to the pile. You are now ready to start the game. The game play stays the same except for the following changes.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, the start player places the mammoth herd on the resource shown by the top-most bonus tile. For example, if the tile shows a brick, the start player puts the mammoth herd into the clay pit. Then, he/she picks the first bonus tile and places it face up next to the pile. (The resource that is now shown is of no importance in this round.) If there are no bonus tiles left, the whole herd is tamed. In this case, you remove the mammoth herd and continue playing according to the normal rules. You place your people as usual. Only in the phase in which you use the actions of your people figures, the mammoth herd becomes important. When you have people placed on the resource on which the mammoth herd stays, you roll the dice as usual and take your resources. Immediately after this, you may move one or more people from the resource where the mammoth herd is placed to the bonus tile that was turned over. With these people figures, you can try to tame a mammoth later in order to have help for your work. You are only allowed to move people figures from this resource production area, and you immediately have to pay 1 food for each people figure you place on the bonus tile. You may - as it is the case for feeding - substitute 1 food with 1 resource. People figures that are not placed on the bonus tile must be taken back to the player board. After all players have used the actions of their people, but before the feeding, you tame 1 mammoth from the mammoth herd.&#10;&#10;All players who moved people to the bonus tile roll the dice. Each player uses as many dice as he has people on the bonus tile. All players roll the dice at the same time. Now, you compare the score of your highest single die. (You do not add all dice together as usual, and you are not allowed to use tools.) The player with the highest single die score wins and takes the &quot;1.&quot; bonus. He may also, instead, take the &quot;all&quot; bonus. Then all the other players, participating in the taming, take the &quot;all&quot; bonus. Then, the winner takes the tile and places it face down in front of himself. (The O on the back is not for the player. It just serves as a reminder for the final scoring). When the highest die scores are level, the players compare the next lower score, etc.&#10;&#10;If there is still a draw after comparing all results, all players involved get the &quot;all&quot; bonus.&#10; The tile has to be put back into the box. If nobody has placed a people figure on the bonus tile, nobody gets the bonus. The tile has to be put into the box as well. Before you score the civilization cards, there is the mammoth scoring. The player with the most bonus tiles gets 10 points. In the case of a draw, all players involved get these points.&#10;&#10;",
