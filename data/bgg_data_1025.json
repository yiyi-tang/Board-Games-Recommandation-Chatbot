    "Description": "Have you ever hooked up with someone within an hour of meeting them, or blacked out before 9 p.m. because you were too drunk?&#10; Unlike most of the party games you have played, THIS ONE TIME, I... provides an explicit, hilarious opportunity for friends to relive their funny, dirty and downright crazy life experiences. We have probed deep into the dirty pasts of people to compile hundreds of ludicrous life choices that we can all relate to.&#10; The game is played with Confession Cards, which are examples of ludicrous life choices, and Rule Cards which tell you how to play each round - that make it easy and fun to learn who&rsquo;s the craziest, dirtiest, wildest friend of the group!&#10;&#10;Every round, a player selects a Red Rule Card from the top of the pile, reads the instructions aloud and must then do as the Rule Card says.&#10; If you are guilty of an act detailed by a Blue Confession Card given to you, you must add it to your losing pile (face up) in front of you until the end of the game, so that everyone can enjoy reliving your bad decisions. If you are not guilty of a Confession Card, you must scrap it.&#10; The first player to have 10 Confession Cards in their losing pile loses the game. There are no winners in this game, only losers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As war loomed over Germany in the early summer of 1866, Bavaria aligned itself with Austria against Prussia and armed for war. The Bavarian chief of staff, Ludwig Freiherr von der Tann, met with the Austrian leadership and suggested that the Bavarian army march into Bohemia. There they would form the left wing of the Austrian North Army, and along with the Saxons would hold off the Prussian First Army at Jicin while the Austrians dealt with the Prussian Second Army.&#10;&#10;Von der Tann&rsquo;s bold plan might well have given the Allies victory, but the Austrian commander, Ludwig von Benedek, turned him down and Bavaria pursued a separate strategy. By the time Benedek changed his mind and called for the Bavarians to advance, it was already too late.&#10;&#10;Battles of 1866: Blood &amp; Iron is an expansion book for Battles of 1866: Frontier Battles. It adds the Royal Bavarian Army to the game, based on the Von der Tann plan. There are six scenarios included plus background on the Jicin campaign and the Bavarian proposal to participate. While this battle never took place, the scenarios are based on actual operational plans.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Only featly leading your people and steering your tribe to wealth and prosperity you will be able to become a respected leader of your people! Improving your settlement, pillaging the villages and building the temples in the name of Odin, gain glory and become the legend, perpetuated in a Viking saga.&#10;&#10;In Lords of the Fjords, you start your game in a poor village with just one ship at the pier and a couple of sellswords. Each turn, the players take from the &#209;&#129;loth bag the specified number of meeples that exist in three different colors. Each of three colors means a certain type of specialists and for your turn you have to choose only one one color to perform one type of action: Builders (yellow) allow you to build new ships and temples; Counsellors (blue) are great at diplomatic and trade affairs, which can attract new skilled people to your village, which is necessary for its growth; while Warriors (red), for sure, are needed to attack other villages (because no Viking can live his life without tough fights and glorious victories).&#10;&#10;Starting the game with identical resources, all players must find their own strategy towards the glory. Building new ships and temples brings you more gold and victory points respectively. Improving your facilities allows you to get more actions on your future turns, hire new sellswords that will fight for you to the last breath, or even send an intruder that will get in the way of your opponents and steal their gold for you.&#10;&#10;Conquering unexplored lands you can achieve everything at once: get some useful bonuses, do some extra actions of other types on the same turn and gain the victory points. But you should be careful attacking the villages - most of tribes will call for help of their neighbours when you try to pillage their lands and some of them can also be protected by high palisade.&#10;&#10;Lords of the Fjords is a simple but involving game of strategy that combines different game mechanisms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The revolutionaries involved wanted to overthrow the reactionary and repressive regimes that had been in power since the Treaty of Vienna in 1815. Prince Metternich of Austria, &lsquo;the coachman of Europe,&rsquo; had kept order and stifled change for over 30 years with his continent-wide system of police spies and divisive diplomacy. The revolts had a number of contributing causes: nationalism; liberalism; the emerging radical doctrines of socialism, anarchism, and communism; the changing structure of the economy due to industrialization and urbanization; and even Romanticism. Initially, the rebels succeeded in getting concessions from or even casting out their rulers, but internal dissensions and determined counterrevolutionary reaction erased the gains they had made by the end of 1848.&#10;&#10;In the game, 2-4 players (up to three Rebels and one Reactionary) take the role of the leaders of various political forces in different areas of Europe. Generally, the Rebel player or players' objective is to spread revolt and seize power while the Reactionary player's objective is to retain power.&#10;&#10;140 double-sided counters, 11&times;17&Prime; area-movement map of Europe, abstract troop and time/action scale.&#10;&#10;Designed 1997, as an act of creative procrastination while battling writer&rsquo;s block on finishing an article for &quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot; magazine on the event. I used to make individual copies for anyone who asked; it just took me until 2015 to start making nicer-looking ones in advance.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player reveals three cards, whether from the top of the deck, from those already face down, or a combination of both. If the player reveals a catch, they keep those three cards; otherwise they turn the cards face down and the next player goes.

It is unclear the exact rites and rituals required when one joins one of the Silvermoon gumis due to the great secrecy surrounding them and the fact that once initiated there is only one way the leave. Death. There is certainly no lack of those willing to swear total loyalty and obedience to the organisation, bringing with them a cunning and tenacious hunger to the battle, using the tricks and tactics learned on the streets rather than in a traditional dojo or samurai school, to gain victory for themselves and the Silvermoon.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If the years have taken their toll on his body they have certainly not affected his cunning mind and his famed intellect. Nothing gets past the owl like eyes surveying every situation from behind his rimmed glasses, weighing up the myriad options available. There is nothing that seems to faze this esteemed Saiko-Komon as he quietly manages the ebb and flow of battle, emitting an aura of influence that seems to sap the spark and energy from enemies whilst reinvigorating friends to turn the tide in favour of the Silvermoon. Many Oyabun have felt all the more confident that the odds favour them with Zo by their side.  &#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

His physique might prevent him from demonstrating his extensive knowledge of the art of Jumo but he is a skilled and quick teacher, barking instructions and jabbing directions with his ornate fan, swiftly turning even the amateur into a competent wrestler and a warrior into a master. Tautolu is never far from his diminutive master, either stepping forward to clear his path through the streets of Jima and saddling his famous platform, allowing his sensei a better vantage point from which to command his men.

A Buto as strong and fearsome as any other in memory, to look into his blank stare is enough to break the spirit of even the stoutest. Few words are muttered from this hulking monster, in combat he sounds more animal than human, growling and grunting whilst handing out savaging beatings with fist or skull crushing mace, smashing the armoured like beetles beneath an angry bull&rsquo;s hoof.   &#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Short: Token-based social deduction game.&#10;&#10;In Full: Sanctus Malum pits the power of a few against the might of many in this twist on a social deduction game. Acting as a Guardian, you aid angels in ascending to their rightful place. Or are you an Imp in disguise, corrupting the virtuous?&#10;&#10;Players are attempting to free Recruit Tokens (double-sided tokens in the center of the playing field), with one side representing Angel Recruits, and the other side representing Demon Recruits. Freed recruits are removed from the game and cannot be flipped to the other side. The Guardian's team goal is to have a majority of freed Angel Recruits; the Imp's team goal is to have a majority of freed Demon Recruits.&#10; One player is assigned the role of Justice, and receives the Justice token and the Action Card deck (to shuffle). The Justice role moves to the player on this first Justice's left at the beginning of every round. The Justice will make important decisions that affect the outcome of every round, and ultimately the outcome of the game.&#10;&#10;Each player, including the Justice, is dealt an Alignment Card - which makes them either a Guardian or an Imp - and a Power Card (they may look at their cards, but must keep them secret). Power Cards give the player either a single-use power, a information trade power, the ability to &quot;mark&quot; a player, or the ability to give your team an extra point at the end of the game. These cards help add an extra level of complexity and strategy to the game.&#10;&#10;During the start of gameplay, Action Cards are introduced to the group. The Justice deals two Action Cards to every player, who may look at them, talk about them, but must keep them hidden from other players. Players may play both Action Cards or play one and discard the other.&#10;&#10;Action Cards affect the Recruit Tokens:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rise takes a single Angel Recruit out of the pool and frees it&#10;     Redeem changes a Demon Recruit into an Angel Recruit &#10;     Truce does nothing&#10;     Corrupt changes two Angel Recruits into Demon Recruits&#10;     Fall takes frees two Demon Recruits.&#10;&#10;&#10;Justice's Decision: After all players have made their decisions on which Action Cards to play or discard, the Justice may swap players' Action Cards, up to the number of Imps in the game (so, if there are 3 Imps in the game, the Justice may swap up to three players' Action Cards). If a player plays both of their cards, the Justice can now discard both; if a player plays one and discards the other, the Justice can swap those cards around so the discarded one is now played.&#10;&#10;The only way for a player to voluntarily discard both of their cards is for them to appeal to the Justice, hoping that the Justice will believe them when they claim that the cards will only do harm to their team.&#10;&#10;Reveal: After the Justice has made their decisions, all played cards are collected and given face-down to the Justice, who shuffles them together. All discarded cards, and the remaining Action Card deck, are given to the player on the Justice's left (also face-down).&#10;&#10;The Justice reveals the played cards one at a time, enacting the rules on each, continuing until all cards have been followed. At any time, if one team reaches their win condition, the game is over, and players may reveal their alignments.&#10;&#10;Justice's Investigation: The final major piece to the game is the Justice's Investigation - on the round that the 10th Recruit is freed (regardless of Alignment, instead a total count of freed Recruits), the Justice chooses a player and secretly looks at that player's Alignment Card - beware, however, that there are Power Cards that may affect the Justice's decision and the outcome! The Justice may be truthful or lie about that player's alignment.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, the Justice role moves to the player to the left, and it all starts over again.&#10;&#10;Whichever faction gets the most Recruit Tokens on their side wins the game! Supports up to 15 players.&#10;&#10;",

The Imperial Japanese Army is consolidating its position after almost 16 years of war, first with China, then in a brief struggle with the Soviet Union and later against the US and British Commonwealth. With major gains on the Asian mainland and still holding territory across the Pacific, the Japanese Army is under pressure but holding firm.&#10;&#10;New Rift-tech weaponry is appearing in greater numbers and the Allies political uncertainty plays to Japan&rsquo;s advantage. The fortitude and fanaticism of the Japanese soldier remains a potent force, but it&rsquo;s the Rift-tech Scorpion light walker that terrifies its enemies, a stealthy machine with a powerful weapon load. As Walker technology advances, the humble tank may become obsolete, but in the meantime, the Rift-tech weaponry upgrades keep the proven Type 97-Kai Shinhoto Chi-Ha in the front line, its compression cannon capable of defeating infantry and Allied tanks alike.&#10;&#10;This Konflikt '47 starter set provides the men and machines needed to finally push the Allies out of Asia and ensure the domination for the Emperor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;desription from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Choose to specialize and grow more powerful in certain attributes, or expand your versatility with a greater variety of skills.&#10;&#10;Designed by a role-player for role-players,this board game offers steadily-building character development and a variety of attributes including: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.&#10;&#10;Likewise, the available classes --Paladin, Mage, Priest, Thief and Ranger--  include 20 skills as well as 6 companions who can be hired for each of the quests.&#10;&#10;The fighting system is direct, so that skills can be used to their full potential. &#10;The standard attack is carried out with an attack roll and compared to the monster's defense. &#10;In contrast, many skills have nothing to do with throwing dice, but require the party to come up with a plan.&#10;&#10;Each story contains a storybook with over 25 scenarios, 20 monsters and battle slides for some scenarios. The variety of these monsters guarantees for a constant difficulty level.&#10;We recommend playing  5 scenarios, which will take about 1 hour per player, and then taking a break until your next game night.&#10;&#10;Every game in The Cheap Chapel is different. Apart from different stories, decisions in one game can influence the course of the next game, not including the incredible number of possibilities to customize your character.&#10;&#10;Choose your character, roll starting attributes, put on your gear and go on an adventure.&#10;&#10;The world of The Cheap Chapel awaits you.&#10;&#10;",

He then has to try to conclude a deal with a player by selling, exchanging or buying a card. After doing this, he reveals a loser card. &#10;- In one round, each player plays the role of a merchant 2-3 times according to the number of players. Then, players reveal the winning cards and earn the correspondent coins.&#10;- After 3 rounds, players earn or lose additional coins according to the number of completed deals, and whoever has the most is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kojir&#197;&#141; leads a gang of bandits and brigands with a reputation for robbing travellers in sudden, vicious attacks. His lack of mercy has earned him the nickname 'Oni' - the demon.&#10;&#10;Ruthless, cunning and upholding little to no honour, these bandits and brigands will fight for any side if they have the right amount of money. Nothing is too beneath them and nothing is too challenging, making them the ideal hire for anyone who wants a job done.&#10;&#10;Kojir&#197;&#141;&rsquo;s has the ability to take Coin cards from samurai he cuts down, and make use of those cards for the rest of the battle. Combine that with other skill cards like Rotten to the Core, Ambush and Mob Tactics, and you have a dangerous bunch of thieves!&#10;&#10;Get more out of your battlefield with rules for climbing, leaping (and falling!), entering buildings and fighting from defended positions.&#10;&#10;Rules for night-time battles &ndash; keep your enemies at a distance and they&rsquo;ll have a hard time spotting you through the darkness unless you&rsquo;ve strayed too close to a lantern!&#10;&#10;Rules for unaware enemies, for battles in which one side is launching a surprise attack and the other is initially clueless about the danger. This allows you to sneak around, trying to take down outlying foes without alerting the others&hellip; But if an unaware warrior spots a dead body or overhears the commotion of an attack, they&rsquo;ll soon become suspicious and realise what&rsquo;s happening!&#10;&#10;Three new scenarios &ndash; Sudden Attack, Ambush in the Dark and Undercover Raid &ndash; which utilise the new Darkness and Unaware rules. These battles are perfect to try out the less honourable behaviour of the warriors in this set.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Two games were available at the time of its release (Snixtrap and Wisp in the Vale), but the publisher's web site indicates they plan to develop one new game for the Larklamp system annually.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Card game where players score by forming couples (straight and gay).&#10;&#10;Players each start with 5 cards. In their turn, they draw a card and then either play to the table a couple with matching sexual orientation (you can't pair a straight male with a lesbian female) or a card that affects their own or another player's couples. Cards include children, proposal cards (to marry couples) and break-ups. By playing an affair card, a player can split up two couples from other players and take a partner from each to form a couple for themselves.&#10;&#10;The impact of the 'tale that' element of the game is moderated by the fact that scoring is continuous rather than end of game; so couples that are broken up are those for which a player has already scored.&#10;&#10;The game box gives this game a 17+ rating but there is nothing risqu&eacute; about the game. It is only unsuitable for children who might be shocked or upset to learn of same-sex partnerships or of marriage break-ups.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
