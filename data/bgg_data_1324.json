The soap operas involved are General Hospital, One Life to Live, Guiding Light, Another World, As the World Turns, The Young &amp; the Restless, All My Children, Days of Our Lives, Dallas, Dynasty, Falcon Crest, Loving, Capital, Knot&rsquo;s Landing, Edge of Night, Ryan&rsquo;s Hope and Search for Tomorrow.&#10;&#10;Players must roll a six before they can begin moving on the board, but may get any number after that initial roll. Landing on a colored space requires them to answer a question (i.e. - landing on blue requires answering a question about General Hospital or Guiding Light). Correct answers allow them to roll again, while wrong answers move player to the next person.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on an &ldquo;Award Space&rdquo;, a correct answer gets them the award represented by that color. There are also &ldquo;Star Spaces&rdquo; that act as wild spaces, but get the player an award for whatever color they chose if they give a correct answer. The first player to gather all six awards wins. The rules include a special note that all material included within the questions uses material from episodes up through the end of August, 1984.&#10;&#10;",

You have to sail through this strange, mysterious water to reach the Summer Island where you are going to spend the winter. A proper boat should be built, which floats above the water by the means of magic. Use all treasures of the forest to succeed! Where are these treasures?

The player with the most stars wins the game.&#10;&#10;When a player stops at the harbour, owning a complete boat and at least one spyglass, receives the Summer Island card, announcing the end of the game.

    "Description": "Sasaki is a very fun game that is comparable to poker, blackjack, one card, and hula, and once you learn this game, you will not be able to get out of it. This climbing game for four players is said to be very popular in North Korea. It is named after one of the special combinations that can be played: Sasaki (&#236;&#130;&#172;&#236;&#130;&#172;&#235;&#129;&#188;) means 44A, that is two Fours and one Ace.&#10;&#10;As in all climbing games the basic aim is to get rid of all one's cards before the other players. A player leads a card or a valid combination of cards and each player in turn must either beat the previous play with a higher or combination or pass. When no one can or wants to play higher, the played cards are set aside, and the person who played highest begins again.&#10;&#10;Sasaki is a team game with temporary partnerships determined by the location of the two red 10's, so as well as playing their own cards, players try as far as they can to help their partners.&#10;&#10;Sasaki is played with a 48-card deck made by removing all the Twos and Jokers from a standard international deck. The cards rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3. 1. 48 cards are dealt to 4 players, 12 each.&#10;&#10;",

Play as Orcades, a power hungry nation keen to prove their worth, or Colonia Lindis, who have been the dominant power for a long time, and now face a change in the status quo.&#10;&#10;On your turn you can take one of three actions. Firstly, players can play cards for the actions listed on them. Various abilities will allow you to manipulate a number of trackers depending on your end goal.  Secondly, players can spend their cards to buy more powerful cards from a unique, asymmetric deck made up of three power levels - your Starter deck, your Prominence cards and your Dominance cards. Your Starter cards may only be used to purchase cards from the Prominence set, while these in turn can be used to bring your Dominance cards into your deck - ramping up your power and options as the game progresses. You can also choose to battle your opponent, comparing strength should they choose to fight back, but beware as even a successful battle can leave you weakened, and open to attack yourself. Finally, when your draw pile runs out you may take your Leader's action, the most powerful action available to you, that's only available when you have no options left.&#10;&#10;To win the game. Orcades need to move along the International Relations track all the way to War, whilst Colonia Lindis want to move in the opposite direction toward Peace.&#10;&#10;Recruit a unique roster of important figures, form volatile alliances, and fight epic battles as you vie for military and political dominance in Partisan from Earth Former Games.&#10;&#10;",

You get one of these new cards every time you perform a Build action, whether it's a city or monument. They give powerful bonuses when played, especially if you combine several of the same type. However, your civilization will now have to deal with Decline, which appears as a new token on the Influence track.&#10;Glory cars cost Decline points to play, and you Decline score will be subtracted from your influence score at the end of each age. You'll have to be careful about how many Glory cars you use to avoid losing to many points...&#10;&#10;The Corruption expansion adds Domination tiles to the game which replace the cards from the core box. Each tile appeals an effect to the Knowledge Domain it is assigned to. These are drawn randomly at the start of the game but, at the end of each Age, players will be able to reassign them, which those possessing the highest Corruption score going first. Their effect can be good or bad, affecting the cost or efficiency of certain actions or only coming into play at the end of an Age. Domination tiles affect all players for the following Age, so you can choose to play them to aid you in your efforts of to hinder your opponents.&#10;&#10;Rise and Fall opens up a wealth of new strategic possibilities. Glory and Decline gives you the opportunity to play powerful cards that will bolster your nation if you can pay the price, and corruption gives the end of age phase an exciting new twist with increased player interaction.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It involves General Rapp and a small French army attempting to secure the area along the Rhine, against allied troops from W&uuml;rttemberg, Hesse-Darmstadt and Austria led by Prince Eugen.&#10;Although the opposing forces are vastly superior, it is a brilliant French victory. Unfortunately, this victory has no effect on the events of 1815, after Napoleon's defeat at Wateloo&#10;&#10;Game scale : 1 counter = 1 regiment or equivalent, 1 turn = 1 hour&#10;Designed in 2013.

The first to reach the end is the winner. Players can advance quicker by reaching the bottom of a bat and move to the top of the bat, likewise landing on a space at the top of cricket stumps sends you back, in this way it is similar to Snakes and Ladders.&#10;&#10;It differs in that also a number of special squares are marked &quot;caught Out&quot; and sends the player back to the start. Other special squares are marked &quot;Bye&quot; and advances the player by 2. An exact roll of the dice is required to win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

To fight the Thousand Sons is to battle the entangling strands of fate itself, never knowing whether you&rsquo;re serving their inscrutable ends, even in victory.&#10;&#10;In war, the Thousand Sons combine the might of stalwart Chaos Space Marines with throngs of cultists and mutated beasts. At their core, the Thousand Sons&rsquo; mastery of sorcery means they fight a war of flesh and blood, but also of psychic mastery &ndash; only the strongest enemy psykers can hope to match their potency.&#10;&#10;This 96-page book will give you everything you need to launch a crusade of eldritch terror across the galaxy, and make the most of the myriad units available to you.

    "Description": "The most mysterious of the Emperor&rsquo;s servants, the Grey Knights are a unique Chapter of Space Marines. Each is an elite warrior-mystic clad in sigil-scribed power armour and wielding archaic weapons through which they channel their otherworldly abilities. They are a purified order, incorruptible and possessed of iron fortitude. They have to be, for the Grey Knights face down the most nightmarish horrors from the seething depths of the warp: the Daemons of Chaos. Their Brotherhoods use the shifting immaterium to their advantage, drawing on it to direct coruscating energies and outmanoeuvring their foes through pinpoint teleportation. Their warriors unleash a storm of firepower, supported by sanctified battle tanks, gunships, and giant warsuits whose psychic weapons can banish the greatest of Daemons back into the warp.&#10;&#10;The secretive and sinister 666th Chapter of Space Marines are a force of elite warriors, even beyond their Adeptus Astartes kin. Each member of the Chapter has an affinity for the powers of the warp, and they can channel their gifts in battle to blast their foes apart with bolts of energy as well as the might of their arms. Clad in power armour of unusual design, and armed with weapons of rare potency, this small but deadly army strikes from their hidden base on Titan, more than a match for the strongest enemies the Imperium must face.&#10;&#10;Inside this 112-page book, you'll find:&#10;&#10;- The clandestine legacy of the Grey Knights, including their myth-shrouded founding and classified operations throughout the history of the Imperium&#10;- A guide to the unorthodox organisation and heraldry of the Grey Knights and their various Brotherhoods&#10;- A Grey Knights bestiary with background details for every unit and Character featured&#10;- A showcase of stunningly painted Citadel miniatures&#10;- Rules for units that are available to the armies of the Grey Knights &ndash; including 32 datasheets&#10;- Stratagems, Relics, and optional secondary objectives that illustrate the mystifying goals and remarkable tactics of the Grey Knights&#10;- A Crusade section providing Agendas, Crusade Relics, Battle Traits, Requisitions, Psychic Fortitudes, Honoured Titles, and unique Daemonic Nemesis rules&#10;- Loads more&#10;&#10;You will need a copy of the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook to use the rules included in this codex.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arcana Resurgence is a fantasy card game set in the modern world. Control various mages as they seek to learn from the magical world and, ultimately, control it.&#10;&#10;What makes Arcana Resurgence unique is the usage of Mage permanents as a means of using spells and relics. Unlike traditional deckbuilding games, players are limited in the amount of cards they can directly use. In order to cast spells or create relics, a player needs not only the right resources, but a Mage available to use it.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Mages provide their own resource outside of mana: Intelligence. In the process of opening their eyes to the world of magic, these individuals have also expanded their minds to both the schools of science and the arcane. Once per turn, each Mage may focus their knowledge towards creating a non-magical Relic or &quot;Spell&quot;. However, some Mages are wiser than others, allowing them to create more complex and powerful Relics without spending mana.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Cards count as both money and track, so finding the balance between investing too much and investing too little can be a fine line to walk.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players choose an available action from their action cards. After performing the action, players must flip over that card to a different action. Players can auction a share, build track, or call dividends.&#10;&#10;While auctioning and calling dividends are pretty straightforward, building track can get tricky. Along with building track to increase the value of their company, players may also build junctions that pivot into other company's track lines.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players get money equal to each company's most profitable line multiplied by the shares in that company they own. The most money wins.&#10;&#10;Card Rails Junction is a standalone game in the Card Rails line.&#10;&#10;",

Some games are more dexterity based - such as roll a putty ball into a supplied table top skee-ball like ramp to score points. Others are more on the creative side - such as trying to guess what someone else's sculpture is while holding it behind your back.&#10;&#10;What does a player do on their turn - roll dice, pick a card?&#10;&#10;The person (or team) whose turn it is picks one of the 25 cards randomly with the mini game, and that card dictates the terms of the that round and winning criteria for that round (tallest stack, most pins knocked down, one chosen by judge, etc). All of those mini games involve doing something with the putty. Depending on the card criteria also is whether players (teams) need to take turns or if it is simultaneous action. Once the winning criteria on the card is satisfied, that person (or team) wins that mini game and can move their scoring token on their score track.&#10;&#10;A couple examples of these mini games - One has them use a sand timer and see who can make little cubes of putty and create the largest stack of cubes (without pressing them together to make them stick) in the sand timer length. Winner is one with largest stack of cubes.&#10;&#10;The game ends, and player (or team) wins when one player (or team) wins 6 of of the mini games.&#10;&#10;Gamebox includes&#10;4 Tins Putty (all different colors)&#10;Score track boards&#10;Score track tokens&#10;Sand timer&#10;&quot;coin&quot; token&#10;Cardboard obstacles for certain challenges&#10;&#10;     cardboard bowling pins&#10;     little cornhole boards (2)&#10;     golf green&#10;     Skeeball - like ramp&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The Numbers Game consists of four sets of 20 cards. Each set has a set of numbers running from 1 to 20. The goal of the game is to collect one set of 20 cards. However, the cards may only be added to your collection in ascending order, if you first pick a number-1 card, or in descending order, if you first pick a number-20 card.&#10;The player who first completes a full 1-20 row wins the game.&#10;&#10;The numbers on the cards have been photographed on the streets of cities around the world, from house numbers to traffic signs and commercial signage. Paul Baarss sharp eye for graphic candor resulted in a collection of thousands of street graphics depicting numbers. For this game, he selected 80 striking numbers in surprising settings from his large collection.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Visit a bygone Hagen, Hagen in 1888, one year after it became an independent city in Germany. On this &quot;dice walk&quot; through the city, you can visit thirteen historical places, many of which are still in the same place today, while others have changed structure significantly and some have moved locations or disappeared.&#10;&#10;In Hagen 1888, you want to visit a variety of locations, but ideally you can reach the right locations at the right time to score more points than others. On a turn, you roll the six-sided die, then either bank those movement points or roll again; if you roll again and get a result higher than your first roll, you bank the sum of the two rolls; if your second roll is equal to or lesser than the first roll, you bank no movement points this turn.&#10;&#10;Next, you can move your figure on the game board, which depicts a network of walkways. Most spaces on the walkways are gray, but the board has twelve lettered building spaces in six colors as well as the Rathaus (town hall) in a seventh color. If you start on a building, you must move; otherwise movement is optional. One point of movement takes you to an adjacent space on a walkway.&#10;&#10;If you end your movement on a lettered building (which must differ from where you started), you can place one of your eight tokens in the lowest open space on the &quot;Hagen points&quot; board for that letter.&#10;&#10;If you end your movement at the Rathaus, you remove your figure from the game board and place it on a 4-point space in the Rathaus section of the &quot;Hagen points&quot; board. On each subsequent turn, you no longer move your figure, but instead you may spend 6 movement points to raise a previously placed token in a letter column to the first open space higher in that column; alternatively you can spend 12 points to move it up two spaces. Once you are in the Rathaus, to end your turn, place one of your eight tokens on a 1-point space in the Rathaus.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you must have fewer than 8 movement points banked. Once a player has placed all eight of their tokens on the Hagen points board, the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players score the points listed next to their placed tokens, in addition to 1 point per 4 banked movement points and 3 points for each color of building in which they have a token, with a maximum color bonus of 21. Whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "These rules have been developed for people who have no previous experience in wargaming, yet like to play games. &#10;A ruleset of eleven pages, no more than the game of RISK. From page thirteen on, we included some extra rules. You will not be needing them at first, but we can imagine that you would like some variations as your experience grows. Start with that page when you have some battles under your belt.&#10;&#10;The game is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players or even solo. The army structure that is presented in this writing, can be easily adapted to the number of miniatures that you have available. Albeit that a large army look suitably impressive. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies.&#10;&#10;This ruleset simulates battles in the period of 1861 to 1865, the American Civil War. Units were drawn up in line in order to maximise the effect of their weaponry. The musket, the type of gun that the troops were supplied with, was only accurate on short distances. During a volley all muskets were fired simultaneously at the same target. Off course, this required iron discipline of the men. Soldiers of that age were drilled to fight formed up into line formation and to march in columns. During the game, your troops will do likewise.&#10;&#10;In an ideal scenario the enemy was pinned in place by fire of artillery, the threat of cavalry or the fire of infantry. Once the enemy was pinned, other units could deliver the coup de gr&acirc;ce. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades, or even armies. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim is not to annihilate the enemy unit to the last man, but to inflict so much damage, indicated by chits, that morale is brought down and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and removed from the table top. By a clever combination of movement and shooting, dashing cavalry manoeuvres and carefully positioned artillery pieces, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades and as such, the whole army.&#10;&#10;Your role will be that of a brigadier in the Confederate or Union armies, commanding a brigade of troops. Should more players be available, one of you will play the part of Commander-in-Chief or general. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.&#10;&#10;So onwards, to glory! And, off course: have fun!&#10;&#10;This product contains one rulebook and two commander dice.&#10;&#10;&ndash;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Collect gemstones (and Runes) fight monsters&#10;&#10;&quot;You live alone in an underground cave where you keep your precious stash of gemstones. The thing is, dwarves are quite greedy when it comes to gems so every day you go adventuring for more, and if you are lucky you might also find Rune Stones; Runes, it is said, give you magical abilities.  Of course adventuring in dungeons can be dangerous. They say that there are zombies, skeletons&quot;&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to collect as many Gems (&amp; Runes) as possible. The dwarf-players move around the board using two six-sided dice, and each square they land upon means that something happens e.g. take a Fight card, find a gem etc. Runes confer extra skills such as - Speed, Resistance to Curses and Luck etc. They also have a points value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The winner of the games is the player who has the most gems and runes when all the gems have been given out.&#10;&#10;",

Nyoro Nyoro is the Japanese name for Hattifatteners.&#10;&#10;One day, a hoard of Hattifatteners suddenly appears in Moomin Valley and starts causing trouble. But when a witch teaches valley residents how to deal with the intruders&mdash;and also a way to get their hands on some treasure&mdash;an even bigger ruckus ensues.&#10;&#10;Players catch the Hattifatteners and exchange them for treasure cards. The player with the most points from their collected treasure cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players can exchange as many Hattifatteners at once as they wish for a big payout in treasure&hellip;but if they are too greedy and capture too many Hattifatteners or if they have been forced by other players to catch Hattifatteners, their fate will be ultimately left up to the roll of a die. The player who takes a risky gamble in moving around the Hattifatteners might very well end up being the winner!&#10;&#10;The game is a mix of a sugoroku (or a &ldquo;snakes &amp; ladders&rdquo;-esque board game) and a battle to collect Hattifatteners. On each turn, a player rolls a single die and moves forward the number of spaces corresponding to what was rolled. If a player lands on a space with a Hattifattener, he or she may move one of the Hattifattener pieces on the board (either from the Hattifatteners Island or within the Moomin Valley).&#10;&#10;When moving a Hattifattener from the Hattifatteners Island, the player rolls a die and moves a single Hattifattener the corresponding amount of spaces to the number rolled.&#10;&#10;Eventually, players will move into the Moomin Valley and catch the Hattifatteners.&#10;&#10;In some cases, a player may land on a &ldquo;Go to Hobgoblin&rdquo; space. He or she moves his or her player token to the Hobgoblin space and draws a card from the Hobgoblin card stack.&#10;&#10;In other cases, players may land on the A, B, or C spaces which enable them to immediately enter the Moomin Valley.&#10;&#10;When in the Moomin Valley, players roll the dice to (1) move a Hattifattener and then (2) move their own player token. If a player lands on the same space as a Hattifattener, they can capture it. Some spaces may have multiple Hattifatteners.&#10;&#10;After capturing Hattifatteners, players try to move to the Treasure Card space in order to exchange their Hattifatteners for treasure cards. A player can only draw from the Treasure Card stack if they roll the die to a number greater than or equal to the amount of Hattifatteners they have currently captured. If successful, a player draws the same amount of treasure cards as the amount of Hattifatteners they hold.&#10;&#10;Treasure cards have differing point values and movement events.&#10;&#10;",
