    "Description": "'During the first two months of 1917 Russia was still a Romanov monarchy. Eight months later the Bolsheviks stood at the helm. They were little known to anybody when the year began, and their leaders were still under indictment for state treason when they came to power. You will not find another such sharp turn in history especially if you remember that it involves a nation of 150 million people...' &#10;             Leon Trotsky, History of the Russian Revolutions&#10;&#10;The Russian Revolutions: 1914-21 is a social-political conflict game for 2 to 5 players. In the game, players take on the role of one of five factions (Monarchists, Octobrists, Cadets (Constitutional Democrats), Left Reformists, or the Revolutionary Left) active in the events of the Russian Revolutions of 1917. Some factions begin the game as Governing factions with state power; others as the opposition. Whatever your factions, you will need to build your political influence, maintain your military power, manage alliances with other factions, and protect Russia from foreign invaders. The winner of the game is the faction that gains state power, and uses that effectively to change Russian society as its ideology dictates.&#10;&#10;The game is played on two boards, one depicting the European part of Russia, the other representing St. Petersburg/ Petrograd (Russia's capital city and the 'cradle of the revolution'). Political influence is represented by coloured blocks; a vast range of historical leaders as well as military units (with historical designations) are represented by colourful double-sided chits.&#10;&#10;The game uses an innovative system in which player either spend 'action points' to take actions or to buy cards, and thereby gain influence among various significant institutions, organisations, and social groups which can be used in later turns. Historical events are affect play as they are drawn from time-tiered event decks. New cards are added to these decks as certain conditions are met in game play.&#10;&#10;Unlike most political games, the Russian Revolutions: 1914-21 is  very suitable for solitaire play. There is little hidden information and, while alliances between factions is an important part of play, these alliances are formed and broken automatically as the ideological position of you faction changes through the game. That means there is no need for long breaks in play where players 'negotiate' and scheme - all your scheming will happen on the board.         &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Unlike previous island invasions, in which the Marines had crushed ill-prepared defenders, Peleliu would become a strategic nightmare for the Americans.&#10;&#10;The Japanese had spent months building defensive fortifications and turning the island into a death trap.  Bombarded  by  battleships and hammered by Corsairs dropping tons of napalm, the Japanese held on and withstood the initial invasion. Skillful night attacks and relentless artillery barrages made the Americans pay dearly for every inch taken.  &#10;The terrible 115-degree heat and endless combat sapped American morale and turned a battle projected to be won in 4  days into a vicious 6-week campaign.  With the aid of the  reinforcing 81st Infantry Division the Marines would eventually win at Peleliu, but the cost was devastatingly high.&#10;&#10;You, as the  American Player, have a limited amount of time to  destroy all 30 Japanese Counters from the map. You win the game as soon as the last enemy counter is destroyed, but lose at any time the Morale Track reaches the 1 box, or the last Time Chit of Level IV Intensity is drawn with Japanese Counters still in play.&#10;&#10;",

Instead of an easy victory, the Japanese were handed their first defeat when two of the attacking destroyers were sunk with all hands lost. The surprising victory immortalized this small coral atoll as the Alamo of the Pacific.&#10;&#10;In this solitaire game, you as the American player must hold  out for as long as possible against the overwhelming Japanese force arrayed against you. Victory Points are gained by the number of Invasion Attempt Counters revealed and enemy ships placed Out of Action.  While it is unlikely you will be able to defeat the invasion force in full, you might be able to change the outcome of the Pacific War by making the invasion of Wake Island a very costly and tragic victory for the Japanese.&#10;&#10;",

The players now have to reconstruct these on the moving playing field, following 4 swapping rules. Once you have completed an order, the order card is gift-wrapped and you may give it to one of your fellow players.&#10;    &#10;When one of you has given away his last order card, the game is over. However, the player who finishes first does not automatically win. It is much more decisive to whom he has given his praline creations - and whether he has also received plenty of gifts from the others. So it remains exciting for everyone until the points are counted.&#10;&#10;",

Against the Odds 2017 Annual  features four top designers all tasked with re-examining the 1940 campaign and answering that very question.&#10;&#10;The Seeds of Disaster is a game about how events of the 1930s affected World War II, most especially the German invasion &#10;of the West in 1940. This game connects a war campaign with  the military preparations, intelligence developments, and  diplomacy that preceded it. It is an attempt to represent a  piece of history as interconnected with other historical developments. This is a two-player game in which one player takes the Germans and the other the Western Allies, including &#10;France, Great Britain, Belgium, and Holland. Victory is determined by control of Mobilization Center and Objective Areas at the end of the last turn of play.&#10;&#10;In broad outline, what you see here is a game that is multi-dimensional and coupled. The initial phase of play creates a game history of the 1930s to generate the concrete situation for the German invasion of the West in 1940. By intertwining fresh dimensions of Intelligence and Command, the game creates new ways in which the 1940 situation can be distinctive from &#10;one play of the game to the next. The invasion campaign is the culmination of the game. With this partially scripted history, &#10;how does the war progress? The geography will be the same, the deployment of the forces may be similar, but the details of &#10;the forces and their Intelligence and Command postures can be very different.&#10;&#10;",

Against the Odds 2017 Annual  features four top designers all tasked with re-examining the 1940 campaign and answering that very question.&#10;&#10;'Betrayal!' is a strategic level game of the German invasion of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in May 1940. After &#10;finishing campaigns in Poland, Denmark, and Norway, Hitler turned to France. The goal was to knock France down and &#10;then prepare for the subjugation of Britain and the invasion of the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;Pre-war planning, coupled with valuable experience gained in Poland, would lead the Wehrmacht to excel in lightning &#10;warfare never before seen on such a massive scale. While the French had re-visited World War One with a static Maginot &#10;Line defending their border, the Germans went beyond this and brought in blitzkrieg. There were a few bumps along the &#10;way. The smaller British army and those from tiny Belgium and Netherlands tried to help France.&#10;&#10;The game has two Allied players, one French and one British. They will alternate, depending on initiative, in handling &#10;the automata German side. Internal differences between the allies can arise according to their separate and unique victory conditions.&#10;&#10;",

Collect enough genes to begin laying down cells, then choose which adaptations to focus on and which organisms will give you the best edge.&#10;&#10;As you grow, you will need to make sacrifices to get to the next level, but everything ramps up as you race to the end, claiming the most organisms to win.&#10;&#10;During their turn a player plays cards from their hand to their tableau and finishes by drawing. The game ends when any player claims three organisms (two for a 4-player game), which is also the win condition.&#10;&#10;There is also a solitaire and co-op version with similar game play.&#10;&#10;",

Smile more. Laugh a bit.

Each character has his own strengths and weaknesses. You will encounter people that may help or hinder you along the way and you will rely on getting your hands on the best expedition-gear to stay in front. Both regular shops and the black market is available to you as long as you have cash in hand. Both competitions and individual expedition-goals will drive you towards your goal, but don't underestimate the power of gaining knowledge of places and people you encounter.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of 4 phases.&#10;First phase is &quot;Adjusting hunger&quot;. The player adjusts their hunger bar according to their placement on the board.&#10;Second phase is &quot;Shopping phase&quot;. Players may do repairs on their vehicle (if applicable) or buy food. Players may also buy items from the black market (if in a city) or from the shop.&#10;Third phase is &quot;Action / work&quot;. The player chooses whether they will do a job to earn money or draw a city event/travel event card.&#10;Fourth phase is &quot;Movement / work&quot; The player chooses whether they do a job to earn money or if they want to move towards their next expedition goal.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first person enters the &quot;End&quot; position on &quot;The winning track&quot;.&#10;To win you need to collect expedition points and/or knowledge points.

    "Description": "In British English, a city break is a short holiday spent in a city. City breaks are perfect for anyone looking to relax and get away from it all for a few days, as well as seeking out authentic experiences. City Break is about your memories that you are proud of and like to tell people about, and the roles you adopt when you talk about your past travels!&#10;You come back from your city breaks very enthusiastic and ready to share them with others. Your memories turn into posts on social media or face-to-face narrations about what you have observed, encountered, or undergone. You have to announce your adventures to the world! And you don't usually tell trivial stories!&#10;Who are you when you boast about where you went and what you did or saw? When you talk passionately about the arts, you turn into a Culture Creature. You are also the Royalty Buff who devours biographies of kings and queens and enjoys visiting their castles and palaces. There is an inner Happy Foodie inside you who loves mentioning unique and memorable food and drink experiences. Your social media profiles reveal a Nature Lover who marvels at the mysteries of nature and appreciates natural beauty. Only a Sights Seeker would plan ahead for trips to the world's busiest sights and landmarks. Your followers can't wait to watch live the Motion Addict who loves public transport, the best way to connect to the city.&#10;&#10;City Break is a one-of-a-kind puzzle-solving board game specifically designed for a pair of gamers. What makes City Break truly awesome is that it manages to achieve an incredible strategic depth in a two-player setting. City Break is about adapting to new information, making the right choices at the right time, and solving the puzzle of the combinations of available digit-tiles, cards, and action tokens. The game gets more and more intense with each played card, while you have to keep an eye on your opponent's playing space so as not to be surprised by suddenly ending the game!&#10;&#10;Players use cards to fill six columns with memories, creating narratives about their past travels. They need to make sure that their narratives are credible, so they must bring them into a state of equilibrium or harmony. The credibility of a narrative is determined by its 3 sub-columns of values. Equilibrium is when a part of your narrative is in balance with the other two parts taken together (for example, B = A + C). Harmony is when two parts of your narrative balance each other out (for example, B = C).&#10;&#10;You pursue a diversity of interests when you travel, and you develop new personas when you talk about where you went and what you did or saw. Each of the 6 outlined columns of cards of your tableau corresponds to a + or = represented at the bottom of the 90 personas. Each persona has a combination of 2 + and/or = indicating the 2 narratives you need to be credible. + symbols indicate which narratives you need to bring into equilibrium. = symbols indicate which narratives you need to bring into harmony.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if all 6 of your outlined columns of cards either have complete narratives placed on them or are disabled, your opponent gets one final turn. The game then ends and players calculate their final scores.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to score the most Victory Points by assembling long credible narratives, developing personas, achieving target values, matching images, and earning titles. Are you quick-witted enough to deal with changing conditions, elements of randomness, and unpredictable opponents? Find out in City Break!&#10;&#10;",

The barbarians are uncouth; they have no five-second rule and stick out the wrong finger when drinking tea. There are perks, too, though. They've given you skulls to drink mead out of and spices to get rid of the skull aftertaste. And you've given them stuff in return: forks, mirrors, pants. It's great for everyone.

The first to collect all resources will make this their abode. The Quest is on!&#10;&#10;Dino Quest is a resource collection and management game. In Dino Quest, you collect resources to help your dinosaur family settle in prehistoric park. You&rsquo;re competing with other players to be the first to collect these resources and sometimes even grabbing some from them!&#10;&#10;The game has 15 survival cards. Each card lists the resources players must collect during the game. When a player collects the exact quantities of each resource listed on the survival card, they immediately win the game.&#10;&#10;There are 3 dice in the game, one number dice and two power dice. When you roll the number dice, you can collect any 1, 2 &amp; 3 resource tokens. When collecting tokens you can either collect all of the same resource or different resources. There are 2 power dice, both have 3 symbols on them: spin, grab and double it. The action spinner lets you perform special actions. You can spin the spinner only if you roll two spins or a spin and a double it.&#10;&#10;Your turn begins by rolling all 3 dice. Keep aside any one dice of your choice and resolve the other two. When collecting tokens from the resource bank, you must collect them one at a time without looking! If you collect the quantity mentioned of any 1 resource on the survival card, it does not mean that you &lsquo;lock&rsquo; that particular resource. Opponents can still grab tokens off you and reduce your quantity. When grabbing resources from opponents you must always pick the top most token from any pile. Once you&rsquo;ve performed all actions, your turn ends. If at the end of a turn you have the exact quantity of all resources listed on the survival card, you win the game. Otherwise the game continues.&#10;&#10;",

Carve out the best strategy to navigate the terrain and build structures to control land. But be on your guard! Pitfalls await you around every turn, and your entire strategy can quickly unravel&hellip;&#10;&#10;Ground Assault&reg; is a military-themed game where two to four players navigate challenging terrain, build structures to take control of land, and battle to defend their land.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to control six pieces of land at the same time across the battlefield before your opponents do the same. Each time you play, the tiles forming the battlefield are randomized, making each game a unique challenge!&#10;&#10;A turn starts with 10 actions points that can be used in various ways. The most common ways to use the AP are moving troops around the board and using a combination of AP and skill cards to build something on a terrain tile which represents a piece of land. For instance, if you're on a river tile and you have the correct skill card (in this case the Engineer skill card) you can build a bridge across the river (you flip the tile over and the river becomes a bridge). Then you put your land control cube on the tile to mark that you own it.&#10;&#10;The game ends for a specific player if they run out of troops. Troops can be lost in battles. The game ends altogether when one player acquires six pieces of land.&#10;&#10;The catchphrase of the game is &quot;Control the Field, Win the War.&quot; So it's all about maneuvering your troops around the battlefield (made up of terrain tiles), building structures to take control, and then defending them against attack.&#10;With 100% hand-painted artwork by graphic novel illustrator Mark Woods-Hawkins and unique mechanics, Ground Assault&reg; is a must have game in your collection!&#10;&#10;",

Players act as sheepdogs whose goal is to gather the dispersed flock into the sheep pen, but while doing so, they must keep out intruders. The winner is the player who gathers the most sheep (and points) in the pen.&#10;&#10;Each player has a personal board, with the sheep pen in the center. The game includes a pack of tiles showing groups of sheep or some other characters, such as a fox, a wolf, a hen or the farmer.&#10;&#10;In the first phase, each player has the option to create a set of four tiles selected from a common stock, or to take one of the existing sets. In the second phase, they place one of their tiles on the board and move a tile to an adjacent space. If it is not empty, the tile (or row of tiles) is pushed ahead in the direction of the move. As a result, tiles are rearranged on the board and in the sheep-pen every turn. The goal is to push as many sheep as possible into the pen while keeping every other creature outside.&#10; The game has 3 optional modules, which can be integrated into the gameplay either individually or together to enhance the challenge. The black sheep, if remains in the pen, earns points for the opponents. Trees block some of the spaces. The roosters can help move the worthless hens out of the way.&#10;&#10;---&#10;Magyar ismertet&#197;&#145;:&#10;&#10;Ebben a gyerekek sz&aacute;m&aacute;ra is k&ouml;nnyen &eacute;rthet&#197;&#145; csal&aacute;di j&aacute;t&eacute;kban juh&aacute;szkutyak&eacute;nt be kell tereln&uuml;nk a sz&eacute;tsz&eacute;ledt birkany&aacute;jat a kar&aacute;mba, mik&ouml;zben igyeksz&uuml;nk t&aacute;vol tartani minden haszontalan vagy k&aacute;ros elemet.

You've never heard of tootophants? They are a very rare breed of elephants with golden trumpet noses that are much louder than their fellow elephants with trunks. Now the elephant circus is looking for a new circus director, because every animal would like to have the ring to itself &ndash; and there's a lot of confusion! Which one of you can collect the most elephants and tootophants and play the &ldquo;trumpet&rdquo; to his fellow players?&#10;&#10;Build your own elephant circus in Der Tr&ouml;tofanten-Zirkus! To do this, at the end of the game you must have as many elephants and tootophants in front of you that are happy with you as circus director and follow you voluntarily. In the scoring, each animal lying open in front of you counts as +1 point.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game round, each player draws a card from the edge of the ring and keeps it face down in his hand. In a clockwise direction, each player now takes a turn. Only when the player to your right has completed his turn, you show your card to your fellow players and take your action.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when the last card has been drawn from the edge of the circus ring and applied. Now it is time for the scoring, and the points are counted. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The anointment, moreover, can only take place after a battle in which the prospective knight has blooded his blade. These mandates were established to ensure that only men of true prowess earned the rank of Knight. Even with the Empire dissolved, those mandates are well preserved traditions and those who ignore them meet ridicule. In fact, a recurring article presented in the Imperial Conclaves is the appointment of Counts Palatine, to replace those who may have fallen in battle or died or old age.&#10;&#10;The massed charge of Household Knights is one of the most powerful weapons at the disposal of a Hundred Kingdoms commander. Hundreds of pounds of obdurate metal and muscle, forged through years of training and experience, they have shattered men, formations, and kingdoms throughout the ages.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Puppet Masters is a game where players choose from 27 Masters, powerful characters with differing amounts of health or magical prowess, each with special abilities encouraging a certain style of play. Then the players each pick up to two decks from the 18 different factions ranging from undead to angels to steampunk. All chosen decks by all players are shuffled together into a single draw pile, from which the minions, Puppets, are drawn into the arena. These can be bought and used by the players or hunted for money, money which can be spent on spells of destruction or items to buff Puppets. It is a flexible game, addictive, easy to learn but hard to master and fits up to 4 players in free for all or 2v2 formats.&#10;&#10;The single draw pile is to guarantee all players have access to all things in the game. If there is something directly counter to your strategy in the game in play, you can either buy it up so your opponent can&rsquo;t use it or destroy it before they get it. Players can attack each other, each other&rsquo;s Puppets, or the Puppets in the arena. The replay value of this game is very high due to the massive amount of combinations in the game of Masters and Puppets, plus the different strategies of gaining many cheap puppets or getting just one or two very strong ones and giving them a lot of items, or anything in between.&#10;&#10;There are four phases of each turn, during which Players can perform different actions. In the recovery phase players receive gold and replenish their Puppets' energy, and the maintenance phase they can take turns buying items and spells for the upcoming battle. In the possession phase, players bid on Puppets to control using their Master character's strings (a finite resource moved around throughout the battle to control Puppets), the player with the highest bid on a Puppet gets it as their own. Then, finally, the action phase, where players use spells and Puppets to attack each other. Player turns in each round are infinite as long as you have things to do. This is limited instead by money/strings/Puppet strength to perform actions.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there is only one player/team left in the game.&#10;&#10;The winner is the last Player/Team remaining on the field.  If a player is reduced to 0 hit points, they are out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The White Sack has a drafting mechanism, and the Black Sack has a push your luck mechanism. After gathering the required ingredients and making the necessary potions, players can mix their potions to make legendary Elixirs.&#10;&#10;Each player has 3 containers: a bottle to keep liquid ingredients in (white and red), a mortar to keep the plant ingredients in (green and pink), and a bag to keep mineral ingredients in (blue and yellow). Each container can hold a total of 5 cubes, and tarantulas can be kept in any container. At the beginning of the game, the white sack has many ingredients and few tarantulas, and the black has few ingredients and many tarantulas. As the game goes on and players take action, all the cubes, including tarantulas circulate between the two sacks.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn they can perform one of the following actions:&#10;Take cubes from one of the sacks or Make a potions or elixirs for Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Players keep their cards beside their player board, and the amount of VP any player has is public.

    "Description": "&ldquo;&hellip;an encounter battle carried out too enthusiastically against prepared positions&hellip;not seen or recognized until the attack had been launched.&rdquo; &ndash;Summary of the British attack at Bir el Gubi by Lieutenant General Willoughby Norrie.&#10;&#10;Ram vs. Stag is a low complexity war game simulation of the first battle fought near the village and oasis at Bir el Gubi in Libya. In response to General Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s bold offensive the British-led Allied forces launched a counter offensive to defeat the Axis forces that were besieging Tobruk. Dubbed Operation Crusader, the Allied attack was launched on November 18th and caught the Axis by surprise. However, Rommel reacted quickly by withdrawing his armored forces into an arc that stretched south and west of the crucial port. The British armored units groped their way forward attempting to identify and fix their enemy&rsquo;s positions. Late on November 18th units of the Italian Ariete (Ram) Division were discovered near the village of Bir El Gubi. The 22nd Armored Brigade (Stags), a recently deployed unit to the North Africa, was ordered to attack. In the past, British tanks had sent the Italians into head-long flight and a repeat was expected. Instead, the Italians had dug in and were prepared to fight.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counter parts? Lean and enjoy!&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game represents one hour of time.  Each hex is approximately a third of a mile across. Units represent companies of men (infantry), batteries of 4-6 guns (artillery and AT), or 10-12 vehicles (tanks and armored cars).&#10;&#10;Each copy of Ram vs. Stag is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;8 pages of rules&#10;Two 11 by 17 inch map sheets with game tracks and tables&#10;160 single sided, un-mounted counters&#10;&#10;Players will also need a six sided die and an opaque container (mug, envelope or anything similar) to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game represents one hour of time.

    "Description": "The world is ending and you and a group of like minded individuals have a bunker to live out the apocalypse.&#10;However, there are people wanting to join you in your bunker, but there is limited space. You and your group must decide who is worthy to join.&#10;&#10;You Must Be Bunkers is a 3 to 5 player party game where  the objective is to take turns to recruit the &quot;best&quot; candidates to join  your bunker to live out the apocalypse.

One player is then chosen as the leader for the first round, this can be done by playing rock, paper, scissors or flipping a coin or just picking at random.&#10;&#10;It is the leader's job to listen to all the other players and decide who gets to stay in the bunker. It is up to the remaining players to convince the leader to choose their person, by any means necessary. The person the leader chooses stays in the bunker and the player that convinced the leader to pick their person gets a ration.&#10;&#10;After the leader has chosen a card and a ration has been given, the leader changes from player to player going around clockwise, you then repeat until you fill the bunker.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you have 10 people (including the players) in the bunker. The player with the most rations is the winner!&#10;&#10;",
