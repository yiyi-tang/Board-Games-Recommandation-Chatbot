It gives an insight into the eventful life of sailors. The player who plays tactically with his itinerary plans and exploits the ever-changing winds skillfully  has big chances to be the first to regain the home port. The game is also playable in a &quot;race-variant&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a yacht, two spinnakers cards and a number of port cards, which depends on the number of game participants. Pulled Harbor charts indicate which ports must be visited in each case. If you want to shorten or lengthen the playing time, one can agree on a larger or smaller number of port cards per person. The &quot;race-variant&quot; is played with only 1 set of port cards, which is valid for all players.&#10;&#10;Publiced for Verlaghaus Die Barque&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Tix has 'active' and 'inactive' cubes. Only active cubes may be moved. Making cubes inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active cube.&#10;&#10;Chaining turns is important when trying to win a round of Tix. If a cube that is moved is made inactive at its end position, the player is allowed to do an extra turn if he/she wants to. This means placing an extra cube, moving another cube or removing a cube from the board. But making an inactive cube active again is also an option (if there aren't any other cubes in its neighboring squares).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Poker-type game clearly derives from Primero. It was popular in England in the 17th century.&#10;It is very similar to the later 3 Stake Brag.&#10;&#10;Each player lays three separate stakes, set by the dealer, which need not be equal.&#10;Every player gets two cards facedown and a third one which is revealed.&#10;&#10;1. The first stake (the &quot;seat&quot;)goes to the player who has the best card among the revealed cards. Ace of Diamonds beats everything.&#10;&#10;2. The second (the &quot;pair&quot;) goes to the player with the best hand. There is no drawing or opportunity to improve your hand. Bluffing is key. These are similar to poker hands, but with only 3 cards, the odds are different, and the &quot;prial&quot; (pair royal) or 3 of a kind, is the best hand. There are an unlimited number of betting rounds, as in Brag. Each player must match or exceed the previous bet. All bets go into the pot as they are laid. This is much more dangerous than poker betting. Betting continues round and round until only 2 players are left, and can continue until one player pays to &quot;see&quot; the other by putting double the last bet into the pot. Hands are then compared.&#10;&#10;Hands, Best to Worst:&#10;&#10;Prial 3's (3-3-3)&#10;Prial - 3 of a kind - 3 cards of the same rank&#10;Running Flush or Run on the Bounce (Straight Flush) - all same suit, numbers in sequence&#10;Run (Straight) - numbers in sequence&#10;Flush - all same suit&#10;Pair - 2 cards of the same rank&#10;High card - highest ranked card. Aces are high, Ace of Diamonds beats other aces.&#10;&#10;The winner takes the pot.&#10;&#10;3. The third stake (the &quot;post&quot;) goes to the player who can make 31 points. Royalty and Aces are both worth 10 points. Closest on the low side to 31 wins. (in some later versions, 21 points). A total of more than 31 &quot;busts&quot; and the player is out. If tied, highest card wins. Ace of Diamonds beats other aces. Some rules allow players to draw ONE card only to improve their hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Brag is a popular British gambling game. It is one of the ancestors of Poker. A number of cards is dealt, depending on the version played, and players either discard to three cards, or make more hands, each containing three cards. One round of betting is follows. Every player has to bet at least as much, as the previous player, or fold. This continues until only one player remains, or two players are left, and one of them decides to &quot;see&quot;. He has to pay twice as much as the previous bet, and the opponent shows his cards. The player who paid can (but does not have to) show his cards now; if they are better, he wins, with worse cards or in case of equality he loses.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simple dice rolling race around Australia in the immediate post-Federation period (1910s). Recorded in National Archives of Australia as first registered and exhibited in 1911.&#10;Start in any state/federal capital. Roll one die to move. Get an extra roll if you land on a state/federal capital (square space). Lose a turn if you land on other towns (large circles). Return to you starting city on an exact roll to win. If a roll would land you on an already-occupied space, you don't move, and lose that turn.  &#10;The map shows the Northern Territory as still belonging to South Australia (not the Commonwealth, to whom it was handed over in 1911). The space for Canberra is named simply 'Federal Capital', and not 'Canberra' and the city of Darwin still named Port Darwin (changed in 1911). This suggests initial creation of the game between c.1903-1910. &#10;There are two known versions of the game, one featuring an illustration of a brown Wright flyer and mounted on a thick cardboard backing and beautiful gilded edging. The later edition featured an illustration of a red and yellow racing biplane similar to a Hawker Hart of the 1920s with a slight variation to the title being 'Around the Commonwealth Aeroplane Game'. The later version was also smaller and printed on lighter cardboard and packaged in a box with a red border and yellow strip. The game boards are otherwise identical, the map not being updated.&#10;&#10;",

Each player owns a capital city, which forms their source of power. The players have to conquer other areas and erect buildings to expand their realms, thus increasing their chances to win the game. Battles between the players will be common soon.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game is to collect seven powerful artifacts, called Tear Stones. There are several ways to get these stones into one's possession: either by conquering certain targets on the modular board or by winning the regularly recurring tournaments or by purchasing the artifacts on the market. Any combination of those ways is possible, making for versatile strategies.&#10;&#10;The game is tested and totally playable as it is, but the publisher and designer invites the players to creatively shape gameplay and background story and share their ideas with others.&#10;&#10;At present, the game is available in German language only.&#10;&#10;",

As a player you're one of them - you must form a team and get as much notoriety as you can by exploring space. You will replicate the space race: from the launch of the first unmanned probes until the arrival of man on the moon. Each of these milestones will give you Exploration Points; whoever gets the most wins the game.&#10;&#10;Exploration Points are achieved by launching and successfully completing missions into space.  You will need to create all phases of a mission: from building the ship, to the planning of the mission by the ground crew, and subsequent launch. Once launched, your ship will need to get successfully through the mission. You must assess the risks of launching spacecraft prematurely, and also deal with the astronauts and their training.&#10;&#10;Finally, other players will try to reach the Moon before you because this is the space race!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a board-game-fox-chase, depicting huntsmen and dogs chasing a fox!&#10;&#10;The publisher thinks this game will lift the gloom of a Winter's day.&#10;&#10;The Fox is chased along the roads, from 'Going Out' in the left corner, and terminating on the right side, either in the death of the Fox or the 'Throwing Out' of the Huntsmen.&#10;&#10;The Totum acts as the die. When spun, it will end on one of two letters; S for Scent, or F for Fault.If an S is spun, the fox moves to the first space on the board from Going Out bearing the letter S. And if F is spun, the fox moves to the first space upwards marked with an F. Players now follow, keeping to these rules. If in Scent, the fox always moves toward the direct road. If he is in Fault, he must be moved upwards and to the left to the next F space on the board. The Fox can only move along the roads. If he is in Fault and it is the next player's turn and he stays in Fault, he has to be moved backwards to the previous F, and so on until he reaches a road where he can move forward as long as he is in Scent.&#10;&#10;On arriving at Hope Turning, if the next player spins an S for Scent, that player wins the game by bringing the Fox to his death. But if that player spins an F for Fault, that player is thrown out of the game. The succeeding player now takes his chance on Hope Turning unless the former player, instead of being thrown out, decides to take the Fox to Agony Corner and pay 8 counters into the Pool for the privilege of another try. If he spins an S, the fox is again moved to the S at the end of Turn Off-Again Lane. If he spins an F he is again thrown out and the fox is put back on Hope Turning and the next player tries his luck.&#10;&#10;It would appear, but not clearly, that some spaces require putting counters into the Pool and some allow for counters to be removed from the Pool. If all the Huntsmen are thrown out, the Pool stays and another game must be started from the beginning. If a huntsman wins the game, he keeps the Pool.&#10;&#10;",

Making fun of the contentious 'farming scoring' in Carcassonne, it uses meeples that are prone (farmers) as the checkers. In keeping with this, the 8x8 checkerboard alternating between the farmer&rsquo;s fields and 'city tiles'.&#10;&#10;ADDITIONALLY: Included in the game is a very brief synopsis of the alternate ways that farmers may be scored as well as other common, simple, Carcassonne play-style questions. But, the main focus is checkers, so a pair of dice is included for playing a variation called Irish Draughts. (yes, this could be considered a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; game.)&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY SUMMARY: Alternating moves on each other, players may advance their farmers diagonally one space to open field. Typically, the black meeples (and blue die for variant) are used by the groom whereas the white 'farmers' (and pink die) are for the bride. You must jump your partner whenever possible. Farmers reaching an opponent&rsquo;s back row are 'kinged' by being placed in the erect position. They are then free to move in any direction.&#10;&#10;GOAL: The winner of the game is the one to either 1) be the first to remove all the opponent&rsquo;s pieces, or 2) contain the opponent so they cannot move.&#10;&#10;",

The pawns' strengths are decided by a two-dimensional scissors-paper-stone method, based on some of Aisopos' fables: The human outsmarts the fox, the fox takes the mouse, but the mouse defeats the human. The Lion defeats both human, fox and mouse, which in turn all three defeat the ant. But the ant is the only one who defeats the lion.&#10;&#10;Players start with 2 of each creature and take turns either placing a hidden pawn or moving an already placed pawn. If you move onto another pawn, the attacker secretly looks at the defending pawn, and the defeated pawn is taken off the board and placed before the winning pawn's player.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is completely out of pawns, and the winner is the player who has most points in defeated pawns. The different creatures are worth different amount of points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game number 10 in the Napoleonic 20 series (Germany 20 #2)&#10;&#10;On the same day as the Battle of Dresden, Marshal MacDonald&rsquo;s forces on the flank of Napoleon&rsquo;s army stumbled upon a Russo-Prussian force of about equal size under Marshal von Bl&uuml;cher, and the accidental Battle of Katzbach ensued amidst a heavy thunderstorm. Both armies were surprised, but MacDonald struck first. His attack lost impetus in the rain and confusion, allowing Bl&uuml;cher to strike back. The Allies inflicted heavy losses on the French, weakening Napoleon&rsquo;s position in Germany. The French defeats here, at Kulm (four days later), and Dennewitz (on 6 September) negated Napoleon&rsquo;s victory at Dresden.&#10;&#10;This game features only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. It is the addition of &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 division, each hex is about 800 meters, and each turn is roughly 3 daylight hours (or 10 night hours).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This supplement to the game Hammerin' Iron (1992) describes itself as more of an expansion than a rewrite.  It is intended to be played with 1/600 scale miniatures, although conversions to other scales would be relatively straightforward.&#10;&#10;Hammerin' Iron 2 is a set of rules designed to covers river conflicts of the American Civil War, 1861 to 1865.&#10;&#10;This rules system uses a hex movement system that is described as original to Peter Pig.  This system requires that each ship miniature be placed upon a 5.5&quot; hexagon cutout.  The hexagons are used as a 'floating' hex grid radiating from each ship miniature.  These hexes offer the ease of a hex grid in regulating movement, but since rotations of odd angles (for example, 34 or 52 degrees rotation) are possible, this system is free of the constraints of a traditional grid which would limit ships to 60 degree rotations.&#10;&#10;Combat is based on a dice-pool system, in which to-hit modifiers affect the number of dice rolled. Each dice result of 5 or 6 (on a d6) is a potential hit, which is then tested against armor deflection. Potential hits not successfully deflected score hull hits.&#10;&#10;A major change in this rules system compared to the first edition is the omission of the ship schematics and crew counters (in which individual crew counters were moved about the ship to allocate crew to various ship functions).  However, if one views Hammerin' Iron 2 as an &quot;expansion&quot; rather than &quot;rewrite&quot;, then one is open to include the crew and schematic rules from 1st edition in the Hammerin' Iron 2 rules.&#10;&#10;Equipment (in addition to the rules) required for play include:&#10;&#10;     Ship models (1/600 scale preferred)&#10;     approximately 12 hexagons cut from 5.5-inch plastic or cardboard circles&#10;     approximately 16 six-sided dice&#10;     cardstock or felt cutouts to represent sandbars, shallows, shorelines etc&#10;     cotton (white or black) to represent damage to ships&#10;     notepaper and pencil&#10;     order cards (can be cut from rulebook, or alternatively prepared from cardstock)&#10;&#10;&#10;",
