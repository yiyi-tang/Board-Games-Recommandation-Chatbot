    "Description": "The thematic setting of the game is the North American prairie as it was first being settled in the late 1800's and early 1900's.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to build the most profitable farming operation.  Each player starts with a cash loan and one of 57 available sections of land, and may buy more land on any turn.  On each section of land, players may plant one of four crops or raise one of four kinds of livestock. &#10; Each turn represents one of the four seasons.  The game consists of 20 turns (five &quot;years&quot; or full crop cycles).  Each turn or season is divided into 3 phases which are played simultaneously by all players.  In the &quot;Purchase&quot; phase players may buy land and animals and (if in season) plant crops.  The &quot;Event&quot; phase consists of drawing cards which introduce events or conditions which may or may not affect players.  For example, when a Tornado or Oil Strike event is drawn, a die roll mechanism is used to select specific land sections which are affected. In the &quot;Harvest&quot; phase, players sell any mature crops or livestock at the market price listed on a master Harvest card drawn for that turn.&#10;&#10;Players may pay off their initial loan at any time.  The amount due (representing combined principal and interest) grows substantially each &quot;year&quot;.  After the final turn, the player with the most cash left after paying off the loan is the winner.  Land and other permanent farming assets may not be sold to raise cash.  This simulates the practice of the first generation retiring and handing the farming operation intact to the next generation.&#10;&#10;The game mechanism allows for solitaire play, in which the object would be to record a personal best amount of cash at the end.  The primary effect of introducing more players is the competition for prime farmland.  The length of play is not affected greatly since each phase is played simultaneously by all.  Game testing showed a substantial increase in speed of play after players had played 2-3 times.  For a game in which most or all players are novices, allow 4 hours.&#10;&#10;Although the game includes a substantial amount of luck (farmers cannot control weather or market prices) it cannot be won by luck alone.  Successful players will learn how to best farm different types of land (it is not all equal), manage risk, and select appropriate crop or livestock strategies (the various options include a wide range of risk/reward trade offs).&#10;&#10;The game could be used in an educational setting either to illustrate the historical settling of the prairies or to demonstrate the basics of investing in any context (managing risk, balancing a portfolio, using leverage, etc.)&#10;&#10;",

The game is smaller than a typical Monopoly board, and as such, so are the title deeds, chance and community chest cards, and bank notes,  The houses and hotels are also redesigned in the Michael Graves style, and come in velvet pouches for storage when not in use.  The tokens are based on the designs that Mr. Graves has submitted to Target for different household items (Cup &amp; Saucer, Telephone, Wall Clock, Blender, Tea Kettle, and Toaster).  And this all is enclosed in a very attractive wood box.  The board folds open on the top like the top of a cigar or jewelery box, with side supports that swing out from the back, and there is a drawer on the side to store the tokens, buildings, cards, deeds, and money.  This drawer functions as Money rack when playing the game.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the submarine commander is to take the mothership off the board through an exit point; the surface commander tries to prevent this and capture the mothership. (For the purpose of the victory condition, the mini-subs and destroyers are expendable.) Both sides can capture the other's vessels by sandwiching an enemy vessel between two of their own. Captured vessels are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The board also has several &quot;military secrets&quot;; by placing any of his vessels on such a space the sub commander forces the surface commander to remove one destroyer (her choice).&#10;&#10;The game includes one rules variant.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;     Hnefatafl&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Units are platoons and sections, with some individual vehicles and leaders. Counters are a robust 7/8&quot; square, with values for firepower, armor, range, and movement, plus the occasional frontal armor of zone of control.  Maps are designed to correspond to US military maps, replacing 1000m grid squares with large hexes.

    "Description": "(from publishers' website)&#10;&#10;The Next Wars series brings battalion-level modern shooting wars to your tabletop. Combat units must synchronize attacks and defenses to maximize their collective combat power. Headquarters units coordinate actions on the battlefield and support battalions maintain supply lines. &#10;The Next Wars is scaled at 10km/hex, with 12-hour turns. Units are battalions, headquarters, and specialty companies.&#10;&#10;Following a series of contentious elections in which both sides accused the other of support from outside the country, the Ukraine began to fracture.   What started as competing protest marches in the streets rapidly escalated into a shooting war between the different factions.   When the President of the Ukraine finally ordered the Army to restore order, several units revolted, and the President appealed to NATO for assistance. Ignoring Russian warnings against intervening, NATO provided a small UK-led force, which the Russians countered with a reinforced mechanized corps, plus reinforcements from their Belorussian allies.   The US sent their available forces to the Polish frontier, hoping that their deterrent effect would stabilize the situation. The Ukrainian &quot;Interventionists&quot; (so named for their favorability toward Russian &quot;intervention&quot;) had organized their own fighting force around the two mechanized brigades (and assorted smaller units) that mutinied against the national command.   Russian operatives assisted in arming and organizing the &quot;101 Brigade&quot; from provinces near the border; other partisans throughout the Ukraine also took up arms on the Interventionist side.&#10;&#10;The Ukrainian government incorporated their volunteers into the standing army, hoping to avoid any public relations backlash from having irregular forces on the battlefield, as they attempted to paint the conflict as a civil war in which the Russians were meddling and NATO were invited peacekeepers. The first battles were joined near Lvov, as the Interventionists bypassed Kiev and pushed as far west as possible, hoping to prevent the NATO forces from establishing a bridgehead in the Ukraine. Russian and Belorussian reinforcements arrived from the north to try and flank the existing Ukrainian national forces before NATO could join the fight. The Americans were moving through Poland, but had concerns about the security of their supply lines.&#10;&#10;Civilians are a fact of life on the modern battlefield, and they are present in The Next Wars. Neutral and benign, local civilians may come to support one faction or another based on the behavior of the forces of the battlefield. Headquarters units also enable players to deploy command cards that allow give units special actions or bonuses on the battlefield. Simulating the staff planning process, the mission cards allow units to prepare and rehearse certain missions for later execution.&#10;&#10;",

Each office on a state increases the chances of collecting votes during primaries which are held on a fixed calendar at certain turns of the game.  Movement is 0-5 squares at player's choice, but an end-of-turn die role introduces random events.&#10;&#10;Strategy consists primarily of shrewd choice of states in which to compete -- you can spread over many small states, concentrate on a few large ones, or make some attempt at a hybrid.  Player vs. player interaction is limited; the end-of-turn event roll gives you a 1/6th chance of being able to send an opponent to the Federal Election Commission space (which is, effectively, jail).&#10; Components, unusually, include a cork board and colored pins. The game otherwise has poor production values by modern standards (it appears to have been a self-published one-shot and is more than 25 years old), but is redeemed by a simple and effective design.&#10;&#10;This is a quick-playing, light-weight, clever game that exploits its topic well and is worth two or three plays in the unlikely event that you can find a copy.&#10;&#10;It is regrettable that the game does not credit its designer, and the name of the publisher is an obvious joke punning on &quot;gerrymander&quot;&#10;&#10;This game is long out of print and rare.&#10;&#10;",
