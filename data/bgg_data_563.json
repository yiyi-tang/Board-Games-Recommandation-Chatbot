This deadly contest is known as a deathmatch.&#10;&#10;The most powerful heroes among the mortal races are known as Avatars of War--heroes chosen by the Gods of War themselves.  These Avatars, in addition to being fierce combatants, are able to draw upon the silver of divinity within their souls for the power to expand their already awesome combat abilities.&#10;&#10;In Arena DeathMatch, each player controls a band of Avatars of War as they face off on the arena floor in front of a cheering (or jeering) crowd.&#10;&#10;The perils of the Arena stand against you: traps, hazards and even savage beasts stand between you and your opponent.  The door to the Arena opens, and the shouting crowd is eager to see their favourite heroes fight to the death.  Will they be cheering your victory...or your death?  There's only one way to find out!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;7 Major International Companies are developing the Worlds Ocean Resources. Players buy stocks in these companies and control how they grow. Board Game for 2-7 players.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 10x10 grid using tiles and cubes. Also required for play are Stock cards, paper money (or any reasonable substitute), and a scoring track. The board is randomly filled with tiles at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for five rounds. During each round there are seven turns. Each turn starts with the players bidding for control of a single share of stock from one of the seven companies. The player winning the bid operates the company for that round (represented by placing cubes on the board). These operations determine the value of the company, which in turn determines the amount of money paid as dividends to the stockholders for that company.&#10;&#10;Once seven turns have been played, one for each company, the round ends and dividends are paid to stockholders. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

While Classic BattleTech: Starterbook &#226;&#128;&#147; Sword and Dragon serves as a link between the BattleTech: Introductory Box Set and the full tournament/standard rules found in BattleTech: Total Warfare, Starterbook: Wolf and Blake links Total Warfare to BattleTech: Tactical Operations, the on-world advanced core rulebook. Wolf and Blake also offers an introduction to the current Jihad storyline and to the religiously driven Word of Blake faction. The famed Black Widow Company serves as the opposing force.&#10;&#10;Wolf and Blake follows the basic pattern laid out in Sword and Dragon: brief bits of fiction, profiles of each side's history and current Mechwarriors, a rules annex (here previewing some of the advanced rules from TacOps), a &quot;warchest&quot; campaign system, and a series of branching missions that players can explore. The book ends with a series of filled-in record sheets, including variant 'Mechs depicted in the text.&#10;&#10;Total Warfare is required to use Starterbook: Wolf and Blake. Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade is recommended.&#10;&#10;",

T&uuml;rkenkrieg dealt with the war between the Imperials (the Habsburg Austrian Empire) and the Ottoman Empire along the Danube. HGH investigates the theatre of the Ukraine, where the Russians attempted to destroy the power of the Crimean Tatars as a first step toward Peter the Great's dream of a warm water port.&#10;&#10;On the Danube, the Ottoman Turks dealt a critical blow to Charles VI and the House of Habsburg, leading almost immediately to the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48). In the Ukraine, things were different. Forgotten or dismissed as &quot;futile&quot; by historians, the campaigns of the Muscovites against the remnants of the Mongols' Golden Horde were in fact brutally effective.&#10;&#10;8 scenarios and 1 Campaign&#10;&#10;HGH is not a complete game.

    "Description": "Centrifuge is a trick-taking game for 2 to 4 players, and was originally developed for the Decktet.  Centrifuge makes unusual use of the dual-suitedness of the Decktet cards (Each card valued 2-9 has an &quot;upper&quot; and a &quot;lower&quot; suit depicted on it.), in that the led card's upper suit will be positive, and its lower suit will be negative.  Subsequent cards may follow either suit, but those with the positive suit will be positive; those in the negative, negative.  Cards sporting both suits (such as the card that was led) cancel themselves, due to having both the positive and negative suit.&#10;&#10;If the total value of the cards in the trick is positive, then the highest card wins the trick - even if it's an off-suit card.  If the total value of the cards in the trick is negative, then the lowest card wins the trick - even if it's an off-suit card.  The ability of an off-suit card to win is the equivalent of a trump mechanism in Centrifuge.  Another unusual feature is that it's possible for no one to win the trick.&#10;&#10;Each player is playing to collect symbols of her own secret suit, indicated by an ace she was dealt at the beginning of the hand.&#10;&#10;The game also supports partnership play (additionally offering a Cancellation variant).  The two-player game also offers a Playing for Both Teams variant.&#10;&#10;",

These equipments not only give you victory points but also help your mission: Sails shorten your journey time and help to flee rivals, cannons help to fight them, sailors help in melee combat and larger trunks help to enlarge your profits.&#10;And if you are too much playing for your own profit all the players loose if the rival pirates occupy at least 5 ports!&#10;&#10;The game offers much more, and all is controlled via the YVIO console in the middle of the game board, which interacts with the ships and their &quot;YVIES&quot; and the electronic devices embedded in the game board and - last but not least - with the boardgame players.&#10;&#10;And there is still enough boardgame feeling with the game board, the ship pawns you move, a cardboard ship mat with cardboard equipment and cardboard dubloons.&#10;&#10;You don't have to learn rules, as the console steers you via an introductionary game through the shallows of the beginner in multilingual speech if so desired.&#10;&#10;",

It is further accompanied by 4 coloured disks which have to be inserted into the playing pawns of the different games.

On each turn, each player must do one of the following actions:&#10;- Drop a stack of 1, 2 or 3 stones into an empty cell.&#10;- Drop any number of stones on top of a friendly stack.&#10;- Move a stack into an adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) empty cell. However, after the move the stack loses one stone (stacks of size 1 cannot move).&#10;- Move into and capture an adjacent enemy stack of smaller size (so stacks of size 1 cannot capture either). The attacking stack loses the number of stones equal to the captured stack plus one.&#10;&#10;All stones return to the players reserves. A player cannot make partial attacks, he must move all the stones of the attacking stack.&#10;&#10;Wins the player that makes a 4 in-a-row containing friendly stacks with the same size (like 4 stacks of size 3) or an equal, step-wise increment from start to end of the row (e.g., 1-2-3-4, 1-3-5-7, 2-5-8-11).&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts a period with coins valued 5 (x1), 2 (x5), and 1 (x10). Each period consists of several duels. In a duel, the player who reveals the highest value of coins in their hand wins the duel and moves the puck down the ice (the game board). However, if they reveal at least 3 coins more than their opponent, they lose the duel and the other player gets to move the puck instead.  If a player manages to move the puck off of the ice, they score a goal. If one player has no more coins after a duel, the period ends, but first, the opponent may now move the puck according to the number of their remaining coins. The game ends after three periods have been played and the player who scored the most goals wins.&#10;&#10;Originally published as Spielbox Edition No.2 in Spielbox issue 2/1993.&#10;&#10;",

There's one big coin 'the goalkeeper' and three medium-sized coins 'field players' in each team. To distinguish between teams one of them is 'heads up' the other is 'tails up'. There is also one small coin in use - representing the ball. The goals are usually gaps between two boxes or books each.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics is similar to Carrom or PitchCar - players finger-flick their respective team coins to hit the ball and eventually to score points by shooting goals. The rules of fair and foul plays depend on the variant of the game. And the variants are numerous!&#10;&#10;",

With the German Army crumbling, it appeared that the war might soon be over. But with a line of well-built fortifications and rapidly-deployed if raw reinforcements, the Germans stabilized their positions and would extend the war for another nine months.&#10;&#10;Just south of the city of Aachen and just north of what would become the Elsenborn Ridge battlefield, the U.S. VII Corps attacked the German fortified line. Tanks of the 3rd Armored &quot;Spearhead&quot; Division steadily fought their way forward, backed by the veteran foot soldiers of the 1st and 9th Infantry Divisions. But fierce counterattacks finally blunted the advance; a full-scale invasion of German territory would have to wait until spring.&#10;&#10;North of Elsenborn is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series. There are ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on the battles of September 1944 between VII Corps and the German Seventh Army.&#10;&#10;North of Elsenborn is sold BOTH via .pdf download and as a printed booklet; you only need one. The scenario book comes as a .pdf file that you'll need to print (or read off the screen) in order to play the scenarios, or you can order it as a booklet.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "So you are looking for a new type of card game. Maybe you want a to give a great gift, or the kids are way too active and you want to give them something new to do. Maybe you are a student, or a teacher or maybe you just enjoy most everything about the Martial Arts.&#10;&#10;Well...&#10;&#10;Welcome to Martial World's advanced &quot;Trainers Edition&quot; card game. &quot;World Arts On Playing Cards&quot;&#10;&#10;As most, who are familiar with our games know, Martial World is an American style strategy game, which challenges players to win martial arts based sparring matches, using technique based &quot;micro messaged&quot; collectible cards. These combat strategy card games combine point-trick mechanics with card-capturing mechanics for deck building purposes. We call the deck building process &quot;Building Your Form&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each game box is designed for 2 to 5 players, intended for anyone ages 7 and up, comes with a single magnifying glass, (for a limited time) and no martial arts experience is necessary. Games are easy to learn, easy to develop flexible strategies, and average 90 minutes to establish a winner.&#10;&#10;The fun is how cleverly the combination of multiple forms of martial arts technique terms, combine into round robin melees of attacks, blocks, and counter maneuvers. Here's how. Players spar in rounds which are initiated by the role of the dice and the round winners keeps the technique cards to add to their form. Another fun feature for players who are not sparring is that they may enjoy the micro messages which, for the white belt levels, display each school's core principals and values. You may even be surprised that most of these messages can be applied to every day life. So playing has good life benefits.&#10;&#10;Ultimately our novel mechanics, embedded surprises, and our school based narrative features, provide players the opportunity to experience the many benefits of martial arts without the Epson salt. All may play and enjoy.&#10;&#10;Designer's Note: All of our games are designed based on the history of real martial arts and may include many of each school's or style's myths. However folks, this is a game. Let's be honest, the only way to truly learn any form of Martial Arts is to do research and depending on your ideals, you will find a style which appeals you. Besides that, we are a USA based company and our games are made in America. We were originally published in 1992 but needed a lot of work. We kept pushing and in 2011 we were nominated for the Gaming Genius Awards as the best new card game. We were finalists but needed many upgrades. So we upgraded everything. Lastly we are members of our local gaming group CABS and have a membership with the Patent Tested Parent Approved association.&#10;&#10;We welcome all feedback and recommendations. You may also zoom in to all of our pictures for samples of hidden surprises...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is an electronic game, similar to Battleship made by Radio Shack/Tandy.  The game board is set up similar to battleship with an electronic base and a divider to prevent the players from seeing their opponents grid.  Each player places 1 ship on their 11x11 grid, with the ship taking up one square.  Players have 3 options on a turn, the option of  placing sonar markers that indicate the general direction of the opponents ship (N/S/E/W),  firing missiles, or moving their ship (a maximum of 5 or 10 units per game, depending on the mode selected).&#10;&#10;This a fun game that offers more slightly more complexity then Battleship, and more tense battles, since after 1 hit the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a hand of cards taken from corresponding Mordor and Fellowship decks. The board shows tracks to record the progress of pieces representing The Army of Mordor, Merry and the Rohirrim, Gandalf and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, and Frodo and Sam. Along the board tracks are seven locations to represent the key conflicts of the movie : Minas Tirith, Osgiliath, Shelob's Lair, etc.&#10;&#10;Each player takes a turn to roll dice, accumulating movement points which will allow them to draw a Journey card (again from corresponding Mordor and Fellowship decks), this card then instructing them to draw battle cards, or sometimes to force the opposing side to discard cards. Players must manage their hand of cards bearing in mind the different cards that 'trump' in the conflicts to come.&#10;&#10;As each of the locations is reached by the piece moving there, different rules apply to determine the exact course of combat. The goal of the Fellowship is to survive these encounters long enough until Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom : Mordor has the opportunity to bring an early victory by defeating the Fellowship before the Ring is cast into the fire.&#10;&#10;Though this may have a cover similar to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, this was accepted to the database on the premise that it is an entirely different game.&#10;&#10;",
