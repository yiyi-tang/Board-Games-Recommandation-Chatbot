    "Description": "&quot;Sagas of Mistal&quot; is a 4X strategy game happening in a classic medieval fantasy theme, combining Area-control opposition, Economic, Auction and Building mechanics, with complex victory conditions (a kind of Civilization game, where there are multiple ways of winning).&#10;&#10;A game is lasting about 120 minutes and can be played by 4 players (possibly less or more with other maps). The original intended target audience was the expert gamers, but after heaps of blind tests, it seems to have a wider audience than expected (family+).&#10;&#10;We believe the hooks of this game are the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Replay value: it's a rich, balanced and complex game, with many options of play&#10;     Intuitive and friendly: rules are quite easy to get, the prototype's design is catchy&#10;     Fun and cognitive: an area-control and economic game with dice, which is &quot;telling stories&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;The project is two years old, and has been playtested over 250 times (private sessions, blind tests, game festivals, game bars..). We value balancing and testing a lot, and we reckon this game has a good potential for editing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game published by The Szczecin Philharmonic Orchestra, about ...philharmony. You have to match musicians with instruments and compositions to gest them to play a concert. All that with cards, dice and a board. And a little bit of negative interaction.&#10;&#10;In the box (nicely finished in matte), you get a 4 page instruction, a board with 57 squares, 4 cardboard pawns (with plastic clip-on bases), 50 &quot;Musician&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Music piece&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Musical instrument&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Event&quot; or &quot;Occurrence&quot; cards, 18 &quot;Concert&quot; tokens, 18 &quot;Golden treble clef&quot; tokens and a six-sided dice. The goal of the game is to get 5 &quot;Golden treble&quot; tokens (or 3 in the shorter game variant). &#10;Players actions consist of a dice roll, movement (either clockwise or counter clockwise), and performing the action listed on the space of the board (kind of like in Talisman  ). The board spaces consist of actions like: draw a card from indicated pile, gain or lose a token, use a shortcut, exchange a card with other player and so on. The &quot;Event&quot; cards change the course of the game. You can use such card as soon as you draw one, or leave it for later (depending on the card). Example: &quot;Thanks to your hard work, the orchestra will play at a festival abroad. You get a 'Concert' token&quot;. &#10;&quot;Music piece&quot; cards should be matched with &quot;Musicians&quot; and &quot;Instruments&quot; - for example &quot;Music piece: Chopin - Prelude in E minor. Instrument needed: piano&quot; -&gt; you have to find a musician who plays piano, like &quot;Miss Wanda. A piano expert&quot;, and a &quot;Instrument&quot; card with a piano. One musician can often play more than one instrument, but there's a twist: for example you can get a pianist, but he only plays one composer's pieces, or he doesn't play Chopin's or Mozart's or someone's music. &quot;Instruments&quot; cards (50 cards, but 16 types of instruments) include some technical/historical info; &quot;Musicians&quot; cards are quite funny in polish. If you get 3 such matching cards (music piece, musician, instrument), you get a &quot;Concert&quot; token. Then you have to get to a &quot;Practice room&quot; field on the board (there's two of them; roll a dice or use a shortcut). When you get there, you discard the &quot;Concert&quot; token and get the &quot;Golden clef&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Roll the die to see how many spaces you move along the outer loop (the habitat loop).&#10;&#10;Along the way, you&rsquo;ll discover how to be a good bird steward. But watch out&mdash;you&rsquo;ll need to dodge storms, avoid falling in a river, and beware of birds that poop on your head (it happens). All of these will negatively impact your turn, in some cases sending you backward or in other cases making you put a token back, and some will have a global impact on all players.&#10;&#10;The game has three different levels to play at, from standard to more difficult. Once you spot the required number of birds, which is determined at the beginning of the game, then the game becomes a race to the finish. Turn up one of the four trails to the Bird Sanctuary and be the first to reach the end and you&rsquo;ll rule the roost!&#10;&#10;",

This international business is all about the gold, but watch out for your gold hungry opponents! With the roll of the dice, the selection of a port where you're destined to carry the purchased goods on your ship, and the luck of the winds - you can win it all! Beware of the adventures, fun, and laughs that are likely to occur along the journey.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;TRADE - The new exciting game of strategy, negotiations, and fun.&#10;&#10;Can you navigate the high seas? Run your own company? Build the ultimate trading empire? In TRADE, the board game, you can do it all! Brave the rough Atlantic Ocean, make decisions, and sail to victory!&#10;&#10;In this exciting game of strategy and negotiations, you return to the 18th century to amass riches in international trade. With the roll of the dice, you select a port where you purchase goods for your ship to carry. Next you transport these goods across the sea, for sale. Get ready for many adventures along the way!&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview from rule sheet:&#10;&#10;The basic premise of TRADE is simple: you enter a port with one of your ships, buy one of the goods that the port exports, transport that good across the sea, and then sell that good in a port that imports it.&#10;&#10;&#10;     You get 2 ships.&#10;     There are 6 goods available for trade: Sugar, Tea, Lumber, Rum, Molasses, and Wheat.&#10;     A ship can carry at most 5 loads of goods.&#10;     There are 6 ports (Boston, Charleston, Kingston, London, Lisbon, Africa).&#10;     You can purchase a dock at any port which cuts your purchase price for goods in half at that port.&#10;     Each turn roll 4 dice and divy those results up between your 2 ships.&#10;     There are 6 trans-Atlantic routes.&#10;     Each route goes through a central Hurricane space you want to avoid ending your turn on.&#10;     Along each route are &quot;A&quot; spaces. If you land on those you draw Adventure cards that can be a Task or a Demand. Tasks are missions you can complete for rewards. Demands represent the economic climate and change values of goods. Players vote to keep current Demands or adopt the new Demands.&#10;     You can sabotage opponent ships if you are in the same space by paying gold to destroy their goods.&#10;     If a player lands on the Hurricane, all ships not in a port are drawn towards the hurricane.&#10;     You can bribe other players in exchange for non-binding verbal agreements (votes, etc.)&#10;     Play continues until the last Adventure card is drawn. Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "De Bello Galactico puts you in control of one the interstellar civilizations competing for galactic supremacy. To prevail, you will need to explore and colonize new star systems, build space ships, research new technologies, politicize in the galactic council, and keep your population happy.&#10;&#10;There are many routes to victory; smart plotting and investing in the right political Agenda could secure your political supremacy, or you might science your way to the top, uniting the galaxy in a holistic singularity event. You might slowly plod to economic predominance. An aggressive colonization strategy with the support of your population could secure your superior power, as would the military domination of one of the other big intergalactic players. Reading which path your opponents follow and outsmarting them is key to victory.&#10;&#10;De Bello Galactico is a straightforward and streamlined true 4X space game. The vast interstellar distances covered are baked into the Hyperspace movement system, doing away with the need for a board. Each Faction has different upgradeable ships, as well as a different way to handle their population. Thanks to a staggered action and pass system, downtime is minimal and rounds flow fast.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Hopes that the British would be too preoccupied on the Western Front to deal with Ireland were soon dashed. Troops flooded in from Athlone, Belfast, the Curragh and Liverpool. The Rebels were outnumbered by ten to one, but held out for a week as Dublin was reduced to rubble.&#10;&#10;The Irish War of Independence (1919-21) ended with the partition of Ireland into North and South. This was accepted by the Provisional Government led by Mike Collins, but rejected by the IRA who wanted to unite all of Ireland in a Republic. Collins was given artillery by the British Army, surrounded the IRA HQ at the Four Courts and fired the first shots of the Irish Civil War on 28th June 1922. The Four Courts fell two days later, but it took another week to drive the IRA out of Dublin.&#10;&#10;Storm Over Dublin is an Area/Impulse game of the 1916 Easter Rising and 1922 Battle of Dublin. The Rebel Player must seize strategic buildings across Dublin and hold them against the odds. The Government Player must take back control of the city block by block, using cavalry, infantry, artillery, gunboats, bombers, tanks, and armoured cars, even if the city is reduced to ruins. Each side earns victory points for controlling areas and capturing enemy Leaders and Units. The Government Player needs a substantive lead as the rebels are court-martialled at the end of the game, and their martyrdom may sway the public opinion and give them victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

We all loved the subtle balance of co-op and every man for himself. The pain of taking one for the team by compromising an intended mission to help someone else pick up a Regalia rather than let it get to Cairo makes for some fantastic gameplay with all the deal making/breaking that goes with that.&#10;The end game is a lovely ramping of tension and the option of going for total loss rather than helping someone who has previously screwed you over win outright is also a very nice/nasty touch.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

Double sided cards featuring two numbers on each side are dealt out into five lines known as &quot;streets&quot;. The value of each card is different depending on it's position and what side is face up on the table. Each turn a player or team of players may choose to flip a card over, swap and rotate cards in two different streets, or switch a card in a street with one in their hand.&#10;&#10;When the right-side-up numbers in a street sum up to certain values the player may score that street, gaining points equal to the highest card played in the street. Once all streets have been scored the game ends and the player with the highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;18 Poker Cards&#10;Folding Box/Rules&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mad bomber has caused mayhem all over town, blowing up landmarks and government institutions. While she has yet to harm anyone in the process, the damage she's causing to the city is nigh catastrophic. With all this chaos and destruction going on in Brook City, the BCPD can use any help it can get. Chance Mitchell has taken this opportunity to get some hands on experience with law enforcement for his upcoming cop movie. That&rsquo;s right, Chance is a famous actor doing research for a new film, but gets caught up in real world cop work in the mean streets of Brook City.&#10;&#10;In Velocity, the cops face a new criminal in the form of Leeta Wix, a street orphan from nearby Ransom City with an explosive attitude. Her crimes are focused on evacuating important buildings in Brook City so she can blow them to the ashes, proving to the Syndicate that she's a much better asset to their organization than a liability. Meanwhile, the cops have to solve a new dangerous case. Someone has strapped a civilian bus with enough explosives to send it into the atmosphere. What's worse? If the bus stops, it blows! So the cops have to carefully navigate a speeding bus, represented on the board by a detailed plastic miniature, along the streets of Brook City while preventing collateral damage from spelling their destruction.&#10;&#10;The Velocity Expansion introduces a new modular element to Brook City in the form of wrecks. While these plastic wreck markers can be used in any game, they are specifically designed to augment the included &quot;Velocity&quot; case. With the wreck deck, any time a cop is forced to lose their vehicle, it crashes and causes a wreck. Wrecks block the streets and cause additional stress to cops; meaning if they don't clean up the streets, they'll get fired in no time!&#10;&#10;Components: 1 bus miniature, 1 cop miniature, 12 crew miniatures, 12 wrecks, 82 cards (25 cop cards, 22 criminal cards, 21 case cards, 14 wreck cards)&#10;&#10;",

Peasants have newfound hope of escaping the rigid feudal social structure by embracing the path of the merchant. Through the acquisition of wealth and the expanding dependency on their goods, merchants could sometimes elevate themselves to occupy a distinguished position amidst the upper social hierarchy. Although the life of a merchant had its attractive sides, impediments such as war, weather and taxes all came as a counterpart to their ambitious course of life.&#10;&#10;In Medieval Traders, you play the role of a peasant aspiring to become a wealthy merchant and escape the life of the hard-working laborer. The merchant that attains the most wealth and achievements, measured in victory points, is considered to be the winner. By buying resources common to one part of the known world and traveling to sell them in another or by fulfilling trade opportunities in various trade locations, players are able to distinguish themselves amongst their peers and amass the necessary funds to purchase assets of wealth and prestige. However be wary, as the travel routes are full of perils and the nobles will undoubtedly seek to collect their taxes and dues.

    "Description": "Assemble your superhero team to defeat encounters and earn the most honor! Rescue bystanders, capture henchmen, and form a plan to defeat the evil meeples terrorizing the city. A drafting card game that is easy to learn, quick to play, and fun for the whole family.&#10;&#10;How To Play:&#10;Players will draft cards to assemble their team of superheroes. Without revealing their cards to the other players, each player looks at the 9 cards they were dealt, selects one, and places it face down in front of them until all players have selected their card. Players then take all of the remaining cards (now 8) and passes them to the player on their left (who also is passing their cards to their left).&#10;&#10;Then, starting with the player with the &quot;First Player Card&quot; and continuing clockwise around the table, each player takes a turn choosing either to:&#10;&#10;     Play the card drafted&#10;&#10;&#10; or&#10;&#10;     Discard the card drafted and attempt to win an encounter&#10;&#10;&#10;If they Play the Card Drafted, they turn their card face-up and resolve any effects on the card (Example: the cards says &ldquo;Gain a bystander.&rdquo; They would pick up one of the purple bystander tokens and place it in front of them.)&#10;&#10;If they Discard the card drafted and attempt to win an encounter, the player places the drafted card face-up in a discard pile in the middle of the table. They then attempt to win an Encounter, seeing if they are able to meet the requirements of one of the face-up Encounters. If they are able to do so, they place the defeated Encounter face-up in their play area. If the encounter had any special text on it, resolve those now. (Examples of special text: &ldquo;Discard two superheroes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gain a planning token&rdquo;)&#10;&#10;After ALL players have revealed their drafted card and resolved any special card abilities, replenish any Encounters that were defeated from the face up available Encounters. Then the players pick up the stack of cards that were passed to them from their right. Repeat the process of choosing a card until all cards have been drafted.&#10;&#10;After the last cards are drafted, players count up the Honor (Victory points) they earned. Add all Honor earned from defeated Encounters, rescued Bystanders (each purple bystander token is one honor), and any additional Honor from any Ally cards drafted (Allies do not have an icon in the top left corner and also refer to &ldquo;At end of round&hellip;&rdquo;). The player with the most Honor is the winner!&#10;&#10;TYPES OF CARDS AND TOKENS&#10;Superheroes - There are four types of Superhero cards: Strong (green fist), Telepathic (blue eye), Fast (yellow bolt), and Flying (pink wing).&#10;&#10;Allies &ndash; Allies give additional Honor at the end of the round if certain conditions were met. Allies do NOT count as Superheroes and may not be used to help defeat encounters. Allies do not have an icon in the top corner (also, the art on all the ally cards is a person that is grey).&#10;    &#10;Encounters &ndash; The requirement to defeat the encounter is listed on the bottom half of each encounter. Some encounters give bonuses or require costs. The number in the top right corner is the amount of Honor earned from defeating that Encounter. Some encounters have icons with a &ldquo;?&rdquo;, indicating any type superhero may be used in that requirement.&#10;&#10;Henchman Tokens &ndash; Henchman tokens are represented by the white meeple tokens. They represent a henchman being captured who can share valuable information to you, making it easier to defeat encounters in the future. Each Henchman token counts as a &ldquo;?&rdquo; icon when defeating encounters. You do NOT return Henchman tokens to the supply when they are used, they remain with you for the rest of the round and may be used on multiple encounters. Multiple henchman can be used on an encounter, up to as many &ldquo;?&rdquo; icons that are on that encounter.&#10;&#10;Planning Tokens - Planning Tokens are represented by the star tokens. They represent valuable foresight and information you have gained to more easily defeat encounters. When a planning token is used to help defeat an encounter, it is returned to the planning token supply card. Planning tokens count as a &ldquo;wild&rdquo; superhero while defeating encounters. They may be spent to replace any icon on an encounter. Any number of Planning tokens may be spent at one time.&#10;&#10;Bystander Tokens &ndash; Bystanders are represented by the purple meeple tokens. Each one of these tokens counts as one Honor at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

So, you&rsquo;ve been commissioned by the King to create the magic potion or else.  If you are unable to create the potion for the King, it's off to the dungeon with you!  You know that it takes a lot of gold to purchase the special ingredients needed for the magic potion.  Each potion you create will be valued in gold pieces and if you can create and sell enough potions to earn a total of 220 gold pieces, you will have enough gold to buy the special ingredients you need to create the magic potion.  There are six potion types you can create and sell to other kingdoms across the land.  As your workers travel the land, they will collect potion ingredients that you can mix together to create any of the six potions.  These potions can then be taken to nearby kingdoms and sold for gold.  You can also use your workers to help in the potion creation process.&#10;&#10;Victory conditions&#10;Sell enough potions in 15 turns to earn a total of 220 gp or greater giving you enough gold to purchase the required ingredients needed to create the magic potion for the King.&#10;&#10;Losing conditions&#10;Fail to earn 220 gp within the 15 turns needed and go directly to the King's dungeon, causing you to lose the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Crazy Climber, a giant Gorilla and his monkey minions have taken over a large building in New York City. You are the greatest Zoologist in the land and the city has hired you to tame the Gorilla and get the building back. Since the building has been taken over you must climb up the face of the building to reach the Giant Gorilla and take back the building. All the while the Gorilla and his monkey minions will be tossing thing down at you to try and knock you off the building.&#10;&#10;The game consists of cards that are building sections, a top of the building and the main base level.  You can create different building types randomly.  Play is in turns and phases.  There are 8 phases to a turn.  Each turn a die will drop from the top of the building, a die will drop from out of a window on the building face.  These dice are what you have to avoid as you climb up the face of the building.  You can move up to two spaces on the building.  Each die has a falling speed represented by a number from 2 to 6 with 6 falling the fastest.  Each turn a vulture will fly across the building sections trying to knock you off.  If you can climb up to the top of the building and avoid being knocked off by the dice you win.  If you get knocked off you lose the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gameplay in Rhyme Time is simple. Turn six cards from the deck face up so that all players can see the 24 pictures of simple objects on these cards. At the same time, all players start looking for objects whose names rhyme with one another, such as shampoo &ndash; kangaroo or doll &ndash; ball. Everybody is trying to be the first one to find a pair that rhymes, and the first one to do so claims the two cards showing the rhyming objects and places these cards in their victory pile. Someone then reveals two more cards, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards from the deck have been used, and no one can discover more rhyming pairs, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The War: The Pacific, 1941-1945 (&ldquo;TWP&rdquo;) simulates the military, naval, economic, diplomatic and political aspects of World War II in the Asia and the Pacific theatres. It may be played on its own or may be combined with The War: Europe 1939-1945 (&ldquo;TWE&rdquo;) to recreate the entire Second World War. In conjunction with The War&rsquo;s Expansion Kit, gamers can now enjoy the complete TW franchise. The game includes TW: Global rules linking the Asia/Pacific and European theaters.&#10;&#10;The War: The Pacific, 1941-1945 borrows many concepts from TWE, so experienced TWE gamers will readily adapt to TWP&rsquo;s game system. However, TWP doesn&rsquo;t just port European Theater rules to the Pacific and hope for the best. The game features sophisticated carrier-warfare rules that capture the unique features of the Allied naval struggle against Japan. Further, TWP isn&rsquo;t just a naval strategy contest. Unlike some WWII strategy games, Nationalist China plays an active role in TWP, and a player&rsquo;s diplomatic strategy in China may be as important as his military strategy.&#10;&#10;As in TWE, there are numerous optional rules and variants, from the Doolittle raid to Japanese Fleet suicide missions. Scenarios include Changsha (Nationalist China vs. Japan, Fall 1939); Guadalcanal; Coral Sea; Midway; the Eastern Solomons; Leyte; Okinawa, 1941-1945 Pacific War Campaign; 1942-1943 Turning Point; and TW-Global, combining TWP and TWE into one monster campaign game.&#10;&#10;Playing times range from less an hour for the smallest scenarios up to 40-50 hours for the full campaign. For those who want to run the full Europe-Pacific campaign, joining both games together, you&rsquo;ll need about 80 hours to recreate all of World War Two.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: High (about 8 out of 10)&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: Good&#10;    Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months&#10;    Map Scale: 1 hex = 46 miles or 75 km&#10;    Unit Scale: Fleets and Task-Forces; Air: Wings; Land: Divisions, Corps and Army&#10;    Players: two&#10;    Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players play pattern cards to the Forest Core for placing path cubes that will eventually scoring points.  Players can also play pattern cards in the Market to collect resources and other pattern cards to build up their hand.  After scoring pattern cards, that pattern card scored is used to create your path out of the forest using your personal map.

    "Description": "Ganjifa playing cards were introduced and popularized by Mughal emperors in the 16th century. It has always been one of the popular card games among Moghul Emperors, Emirs and Maharajas. When it was first established, the cards started spreading to many regions of India in the original form or Hindu form. Nowadays it&rsquo;s difficult to find a suitable deck to play in India. Only a small handful of artisans located in 2 cities still produce Ganjifa cards.&#10;&#10;This is where we come in. Let me introduce you to Ganjifa Play.&#10;&#10;In Ganjifa Play, players take turns playing suits, taking tricks, and building temples. Ganjifa Play is a trick-taking, hand management game for 2-4 players. Several chips are randomly drawn from the bag to determine (one round, one square, and one diamond) the highest suite symbol that round, the time of day, and the location.&#10;&#10;The Round pawn sets the highest deck in the game for that round. The Raja of this suit goes first.&#10;&#10;The Diamond pawn, with the time of day symbol indicates the suit that defines the direction of the game. For example, the player whose Raja matches the chosen time of day makes the toughest decision. Does gameplay go Clockwise or Counterclockwise?&#10;&#10;The Square pawn defines the location. The players who Raja matches may exchange two cards of their choice with any two from an opponent&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;Once all cards have been played, players count their tricks to determine the winner that round. The winner places the base of their temple onto the mandala playing field. If a number of players have the same number of tricks, all players are deemed winners that round and should put the first part of their temple on the playing field.&#10;&#10;The goal is to be the first player to build a complete temple made up of three parts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Those stacks consist of 2 different card types: Material and Action. To get better material cards, you need the right action cards on your hand to counter certain effects and be able to take the materials on your hand. Material cards from your hand can be built into a nest by playing them on the table in front of you. A nest consists of a maximum of 6 cards. Goal of the game is to score as many points as possible with different combinations of cards in your nest.&#10;&#10;Another option to get the cards you need is to trade with other players, but not in a direct way. Depending on the number of players there are some cards available as an exchange stack. Players can trade cards from their hand with the exchange stack.&#10;&#10;Each material card has one of three types, one of four themes and an individual value between 1 and 3. To build the perfect nest you require 2 cards of each type, preferably of the same theme and with an individual value as high as possible.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the adventure card stacks is used up or one of the Dodo characters has lost all of its hit points.&#10;&#10;Dodoresque consists of 90 cards, over 60 of them with unique artworks of our Dodos and their adventures.&#10;&#10;While the mechanics of Cherry Blossom are the same as in the first Dodoresque, the game has all new illustrations, characters, landscapes, and some new special action cards.&#10;&#10;Dodoresque: Cherry Blossom can be combined with Dodoresque: Jungle Fever for a game with up to 8 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Panzer Strike: Western Front is not a historical wargame but an engaging dynamic simulation of tank combat.&#10;&#10;This is a first game in the series of Panzer Strike games which is centered around a theme of tank battles on the Western Front. This is not a depiction of any particular battle, but a simulation of possible tactical conflicts between the Allied and German forces during the 1944-45 period, in an urban environment.&#10;&#10;Dice are a part of this game but strategy and positioning can always mitigate unlucky rolls. Still, even the most heavily armoured tank on the battlefield can be incapacitated by a lucky shot, but you should never rely on it. The outcome of each encounter depends predominantly on the tactical decisions taken.&#10;&#10;The movement of the piece consists of a series of individual steps (forward movements to the adjacent square or a rotation in place by 45&deg;) which resembles the movement of tracked vehicles in real life. In the Simplified rules, the destruction upon the action of shooting depends on the Firepower of the shooting tank (determined by red dice rolls), Armour value of the target vehicle (different values for each side of every tank type) and the Distance between the tanks (determined by a special ruler): the tank is destroyed if the Firepower is greater than the sum of the Armour and Distance values. In the Core Rules, the movement of the pieces is identical, but the difference is that in addition to Firepower, Armour, and Distance factors, there is a fourth one: Accuracy. Its introduction, along with some other elements, makes the game even more dynamic and realistic.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you are allowed to turn an hunny token (one of the &quot;tasks&quot;) and if it has the right color, you may keep it. Otherwise you have to put it back on the playing field.
