    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Ali Baba Spieleclub e.V.&quot; is a special release for the 30th anniversary of the German boardgame club &quot;Ali Baba&quot; and acts as a club chronicle. It contains events related to the history of the club. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

In the game, each player takes control of one of many unique teams defined by classic fantasy races, such as elves, dwarves, and orcs, and faces off against each other in a sport inspired by American football. While each team features players with their own strengths and weaknesses, players also choose a focus for their team that further defines how that team functions in the game.&#10;&#10;Players use actions with their players to attempt to either throw the ball through the goal for points, or have a player run it into the goal for even more points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Using streamlined rules, custom dice, and highly detailed plastic miniatures, Myth &amp; Goal delivers an exciting and fast paced fantasy football experience that players won&rsquo;t find anywhere else. The modular team creation ensures that every player can easily find their desired playstyle combined with their favorite classic fantasy races. Players can also use the free agent rules to build their own custom all-star teams using different combinations of players from all available teams. In addition, players can watch their teams grow and develop using the league rules or practice their strategy on their own against an AI team using the solo game rules, both included in the core game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Deal the playing card deck evenly to each player; cards come in four suits, with values 2-5. In the first round, players discard two cards in their hand face down, then choose a card as their scoring suit and place it face down on the table. (In the second round, players each discard only one card, and in round three they discard no cards.)&#10;&#10;Players then take turns playing a single card from their hand face up in one of the areas. Each area can hold at most five cards, and twice during a round a player can place a spotlight card under their played card to change this card to their secret scoring suit at the end of the round. Once all 18 cards have been played, players reveal their scoring suit. If these suits are identical, then each player scores only this single card, and cards played to areas are ignored. If these suits differ, then you calculate the strength of each suit in an area to determine which suit wins that area's points. Unless the area specifies otherwise, the suit with the highest sum wins the area &mdash; and if a player chose this suit, then they score the area card. All scored cards are placed to the side, out of play.&#10;&#10;For rounds two and three, reshuffle all non-scored playing cards, lay out new area cards, then deal new hands to players. Whoever has scored the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Spotlight includes a solo mode in which you play against the AI &quot;Light&quot;, attempting to win areas as Light plays down twice as many cards. How well will you be able to beat the automated system?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Within the turbulent plane of Astraea, peace is a fleeting dream. Wars rage, tragedy strikes, and the battlefield becomes a canvas of strategy and power. Amidst the chaos, commanders rise, guiding their troops through a dance of tactical prowess, seeking victory by morale or complete annihilation. As a player, you'll immerse yourself in this intricate dance, orchestrating your forces' movements, launching attacks, assembling versatile constructs, and leveraging unique formations to create devastating combos. Each decision carries weight, as the path to triumph requires both foresight and adaptability.&#10;&#10;Astraea: The Seraphim Paradox invites two players into a strategic skirmish on a grid-based battlefield. Armed with a meticulously crafted faction of 20 cards - comprising 10 units, 6 constructs, and 4 formations - players are given the choice of deploying units for a robust offensive or holding some back for greater command flexibility. More troops on the field might amplify your battle presence, but holding onto cards can increase your available actions. Success hinges on strategic foresight and timely decisions.&#10;&#10;With its initial release, Astraea: The Seraphim Paradox provides an ever-rich tapestry of lore and strategy, featuring five distinct factions. The &quot;Shields of Genmar&quot; stand as the stalwart defenders of the capital city's ideals, ever-ready to lay down their lives for the realm. Opposing them are &quot;The Risen,&quot; Genmarian rebels who've embraced forbidden magics to challenge the very fabric of their world. Meanwhile, the &quot;Seraphim Kestral's,&quot; sky-toned enigmas from beyond, bring with them a paradox that not only fractured the realm but thrust them into this relentless war. New contenders await your discovery... Choose your allegiance, and let the battle to restore Astraea begin!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ronin Warrior is inspired by the 47 Ronin and Japan's Sengoku period. In this 2-in-1 board game there are two separate modes of play; Ronin Warrior: Vengeance is a solo, cooperative campaign game, while Ronin Warrior: Rising is a strategic wargame that features various buildings and units that players can construct and train across the map. Both modes of play share the same timeline, game pieces, and characters.&#10;&#10;Ronin Warrior: Vengeance is where the story begins, when Kirashi, a greedy warlord, is instigated by the sorcerer Majo to harm Lord Asan to usurp the ancient spirit's power. One thing Kirashi didn't expect, after Asan's death, the spirit temple also collapsed and 5 pieces of the spirit disappeared. According to legend, summoning a spirit requires 5 pieces of a spirit and an eight-headed dragon's claw. From here the battle to collect 5 spirit and dragon claws begins. The Samurai under Asan had become Ronin, lost their master, their honor was damaged, the Ronin once again gathered, they were determined to recover 5 pieces of spirit to end the dark age and avenge, get honor back.&#10;&#10;In Ronin Warrior: Vengeance each player takes on a different role, such as Ronin, Samurai, Ninja, Darksoul, Sohei, and Ming. You can play solo or you and up to 5 other players will overcome dangerous traps, assassinate enemies, recover ancient spirit, and obtain rare treasures in this co-op campaign. You'll explore an ever-changing world, with endless possibilities in Ronin Warrior: Vengeance.&#10;&#10;Ronin Warrior: Rising continues where Vengeance leaves off. When one clan attempts to usurp the power of the spirit, a great clan war erupts across Japan. You will play as daimyo on your journey to build and consolidate power throughout the nation.&#10;&#10;You, along with other Samurai, are gathered for a special occasion. The clans decide to work together in search of the ancient spirit to gain their legendary power. However, in this cooperative mode, players will tentatively work together while their secondary objectives will be hidden from each other. With your sword forward and a knife pointing at your back, up to 6 players explore Japan, fight legendary Yokai, and obtain legendary items such as Muramasa, Kusanagi no Tsurugi, Yata no Kagami. As you explore the map, you will come across villages where you can recruit various units and heroes to bolster your forces or destroy them for personal gain. You can also receive blessings at temples from Yamata no Orochi, the Eight-Headed Dragon. Each Samurai has a unique story, a unique goal, and a clan-specific skillset. You'll discover an ever-changing world, with endless possibilities in Ronin Warrior: Vengeance.&#10;&#10;In Ronin Warrior: Rising you are a powerful daimyo, whose goal is to unify Japan. Players can accomplish this either by conquering all the other clans, or by summoning the spirit. To conquer the nation, you will use your townspeople to exploit resources and trade with other players to build your empire alongside legendary figures such as the Samurai Shinsuke and Tameto, shaman queen Himiko, and Seimei the Onmyoji. As you expand your territory across the board, you will encounter neutral villages, and temples dedicated to Yamata no Orochi.&#10;&#10;To summon the spirit, you will need to defeat Yokai, collect all 5 spirit shards, and possess the dragon claw. The entire history of Japan's Sengoku period will be written by your hands. Conquer them or befriend them. Worship the eight headed dragon or destroy his temples. Recruit soldiers or raze villages. The choice is yours. Do you fight for victory, justice, revenge, or honor?&#10;&#10;",

Using these scenarios players can explore these famous battles and compare their efforts to the historical outcomes of the day.&#10;&#10;Another prominent section of this supplement covers mercenary units and generals. Here players can really get into the spirit of the Italian Wars by hiring famous mercenary units to include in their armies. However, players will have to bid against their opponents to get the best units and must be prepared to lose their favourite unit to the highest bidder. Each of these renowned mercenary units will have its own profile and special abilities so generals will be keen to include them in their armies.&#10;&#10;What is also included in this supplement are rules for solo play. Solo play allows players to fight battles on their own against an opposing army which is controlled using the solo mechanism, a mechanism that will be trying equally hard to destroy the player&rsquo;s army as the player is trying to destroy their opponents. Using the solo play rules players that are new to the game have an enjoyable and interesting way to familiarise themselves with the rules processes before trying the game out against their wargaming friends and opponents.&#10;&#10;The last main section of the rules covers the Da Vinci inventions. Those with an interest in the Renaissance period will be familiar with the marvellous and evocative drawings of strange craft that have endured through history. These fantastical and improbable creations are given &lsquo;life&rsquo; here and players can now include them in their armies if they wish (and can of course purchase the models such as the Da Vinci Tank from Alternative Armies). But don&rsquo;t worry, these inventions are unlikely to over-power more conventional forces. They are sometimes as unstable as they look, often providing more amusement than fear as they break down or crash out of the sky. Enjoy!&#10;&#10;To complement these weird and wonderful inventions is a new breed of soldier trained specifically to fight them. Armed with new weapons, new tactics and near suicidal bravery, Renaissance warfare really is entering a new phase of destruction and brutality.&#10;&#10;In addition to all this, for a little extra period &lsquo;flavour&rsquo; there is a section that deals with blessings and divine intervention. Commanders can call upon whichever religious authority their army ascribes to for a little &lsquo;extra help&rsquo; when it really matters. No guarantees of course - but if successful, the results can be most entertaining.&#10;&#10;And finally I have included a section that answers some of the frequently asked questions that players have about the Furioso rules. Hopefully this will provide extra clarity and clear up a couple of points that escaped my attention first time round.&#10;&#10;So as you can see, this supplement contains both serious and silly elements. I hope players enjoy both as I found both aspects equally entertaining when writing and testing out this supplement.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Cards have two parts: a grass part with a number of ants, and a tablecloth part with a food item with the number of ants required to take it. There are also special cards with additional rules.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: in their turn, the active player plays one card from their hand and places it face up in front of them (the so called &quot;tablecloth-area&quot;). Once the card is played, the player may discard a number of ants in their tablecloth-area to steal a food item from other player's area which value matches the number of discarded ants. If so, the active player steals the food item and places it under their anthill. The active player then completes their hand of three cards, and turn passes to next player.&#10;&#10;Play continues until deck and hand cards are exhausted. The food items are then scored with a number of stars related to their value (1-10: 1 star, 11-19: 2 stars, 20-25: 3 stars). Player with most stars wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ride is an adrenaline-pumping card game inspired by the film of the same name released in September 2018. As the two protagonists of the film you will have to be able to get to the finish line safe and sound, only one of the players will win, but the collaboration to be able to reach the finish line at least alive will be essential!&#10;&#10;Play your cards wisely, help your ally in desperate moments hoping that he too will do the same with you, under penalty of a scorching defeat by the Dark Rider!&#10;&#10;After preparing the decks, each player chooses a Rider (or one is assigned to them at random), taking the relative Card (if it is the first game, mount the appropriate characteristic clips on the card), the Rider marker to be placed on the first card of the Path.&#10;&#10;There are four different phases that follow each other in a precise order: Route phase, Dark Rider phase, Events phase and Rider phase.  The first essentially creates the path that the players will be required to tackle: in each Path phase, 4 cards are added in front of the leading rider and all those in the queue of the last rider will be eliminated.  If there are no tiles behind them, the first one will be eliminated and the rider on it will suffer a penalty.&#10;&#10;In the Dark Rider phase, on the other hand, the action passes into the hands of the mysterious antagonist who will act following the action diagram shown on his card depending on the result obtained by rolling the RIDE die. It should be noted that this disturbing element will not be present immediately in the game, but will appear the first time a Rider should pass on a Path card with his symbol.&#10;&#10;Should the Dark Rider not be present, the Events phase will take care of complicating the players' life: here a card will be drawn from the relative deck and covered place on the Path.  It will be revealed, and activated, should a player end his turn on that specific card.  Note that there is nothing to prevent different Event cards from hitting the same route segment: in this case, all effects will be applied.&#10;&#10;In the last phase, the players can take turns taking action.  After drawing 4 cards (or less depending on certain situations) they will be forced to play one.  Therefore, according to a precise schedule they will have to: apply the indicated effect and advance by a number of Movement Points equal to, or lower than, those provided by the card.  Having determined the card on which you decide to end up, you will have to apply any reported effects, reveal and activate the Events and, if possible, fight against the other Riders.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game will be to accumulate more points than the others and, not secondary, to stay alive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

A player who can't negotiate a slope is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player manages to complete three laps.

    "Description": "As the tide of Death magic suffusing the realms recedes in the wake of Teclis' retribution, Alarielle undertakes a grand ritual to seed the Mortal Realms with resurgent life energy. But with new growth comes the sundering of an ancient prison and the release of a forgotten deity &ndash; Kragnos, the End of Empires. Enraged by aeons of captivity, Kragnos' rampage across Ghur leads to the metropolis of Excelsis. Already tainted by the attentions of Slaanesh's servants, only unlikely alliances will save the city from its doom.&#10;&#10;The Broken Realms saga concludes in the fourth and final chapter. As the city of Excelsis comes under attack from Gordrakk's Waaagh! and Kragnos himself, it will take more than the return of a legendary Seraphon hero to turn the tide.&#10;&#10;Inside this 136-page hardback book, you'll find:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The story of Alarielle's Rite of Life, how it awoke a forgotten god, and the epic siege of Excelsis&#10;     Warscrolls for a host of new gods and champions - including Kragnos, the twin aspects of Slaanesh&rsquo;s Newborn, Warsong Revenants, and witch hunters Galen and Doralia ven Denst&#10;     New rules for Gloomspite Gitz, including three suites of allegiance abilities, updated warscrolls, and more&#10;     Even more rules content for Cities of Sigmar, Skaven, Beasts of Chaos, and Sylvaneth, designed to represent these forces in the story&#10;     Updated warscrolls for Alarielle the Everqueen and the venerable Lord Kroak&#10;     Six exciting battleplans that chronicle the rise of Kragnos, and rules to play them as a narrative campaign&#10;     Realms of Battle and Streets of Death rules depicting the locations from the story&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "District Commander: ZNO centers on insurgent and counter-insurgent operations and tactics during the Algerian War of Independence. The game deals unflinchingly with the weapons with which this war was fought &ndash; terror cells, double agents, the forced resettlement of ethnic and religious groups &ndash; prompting uneasy questions about how governments obtain, hold, and use power.&#10;&#10;Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.&#10;&#10;All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1796, the young French Republic was no longer at bay, having knocked Prussia, the Netherlands and Tuscany out of the War of the First Coalition. However, the French were still facing their long-time and toughest enemies: England and Austria. Challenging England on the high seas was out of question, because the French fleet was no longer a match for the Royal Navy. Therefore, the French Directory ruled that the best chance for victory was a decisive land campaign to force Austria to sue for peace. Two large French armies  commanded by experienced Generals Jourdan and Moreau were to advance into Germany toward Vienna. In the meantime, a small French force was to undertake a diversionary movement in Northern Italy. This operation, on a lesser theater, was entrusted to a young Corsican General named Napoleon Bonaparte.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bonaparte in Italy: The Castiglione Campaign, 1796&quot; is played on a point-to-point map representing the territory of the provinces of Mantua, Brescia and Verona and uses a simple system stressing the importance of command and supply. Game counters represent Brigades and historical Leaders that fought during the campaign. Combats take into account the role of leadership, cavalry and artillery. The players must carefully monitor the cohesion status of their troops throughout the campaign and choose the most appropriate time to use &lsquo;Forced Marches&rsquo; and &lsquo;Marches to the Sound of the Guns&rsquo; to win the decision. Additional chrome includes rules for the siege of Mantua, bridge destruction, garrisons, cavalry pursuits and optional rules for Leader casualties, the Fog of War and reconnaissance.&#10;&#10;",

Each meal is a different board with four foods displayed that the players must consume. Each of the foods has 16 tiles that are placed on top of them and each tile has a value. When playing the game, players will munch the foods and be able to remove a total value of tiles equal to their character's hunger value.&#10;&#10;Each round a &quot;bad things&quot; card is played. These are events that make the food harder to eat either by having a one time effect or an effect that lasts the whole round. Then the players take their turns, taking one action at a time, and going clockwise. Each character card has 4 actions. To take an action, place a &quot;snack token&quot; on one of the four available actions that does not already have a snack token, and take the action described in that spot. These actions can involve things like munching the food, obtaining an item card for a bonus, or playing a card. When munching a food, remove the tiles from the food board and place them on your character card. The food tiles munched can be used to boost your action cards later. Each action card has a unique effect if it is boosted. After a player takes their turn by performing an action, that player draws action cards up to their hand size.&#10;&#10;Play continues until each player has performed their four actions for the turn. Then the car moves forward one space on the game board. If the car reaches the house, the family has returned and stops the feast! All of the players lose. If the car didn't reach the house, players play another round.

They can also be used by any faction in the game.&#10;&#10;Omen Cards&#10;Ancient Greek culture was steeped in tradition, belief and superstition, considered both bad or good with many of these varying from region to region. A vulture flying the wrong way across a battlefield has caused engagements to end abruptly with all participants packing up and returning to their cities. This element has been added to Mortal Gods with the inclusion of the Omens Deck, with the Omens being read as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;During play whenever a red Omen marker is taken from the Draw, the player who drew it takes the topmost Omen card from the Omen deck. He then reads the card description aloud before following the rules on the Omen card immediately.&#10;&#10;Gifts Cards&#10;In ancient times extraordinarily rare or lucky objects&mdash; or people with extraordinary strength or speed&mdash;were thought to be gifts from the Gods.&#10;Gifts can be given to a warrior in one of two ways: they either have Gifts already included in their Roster card which is reflected in their initial points value, or you can purchase Gifts for the Warriors of your Lochos by spending roster points to obtain them.&#10;&#10;Both Heroes and Companions can be given Gifts. To do this simply include the points value as indicated on the individual Gift cards while rostering your Lochos. You can give a warrior as many Gifts as they have actions and, unless stated on the card, you may only use one Gift per activation.&#10;&#10;Injury Cards&#10;Only Heroes gain Injury cards.&#10;&#10;If a Warrior sustains more damage than their Resistance score they would usually be removed from the game. Instead Heroes take a Courage check. If it is successful he finds the courage to carry on and takes the top Injury card. The Injury card imposes a penalty for the rest of the game as detailed on the card. If the Hero fails this Courage roll, or already has an Injury card, he is removed as normal from the game. If the damage sustained by the Hero in this instance is caused via critical damage they are automatically dispatched.!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players are trying to place their cards so more of their symbols (moon or sun) surround the quadrants with stars.  When a Star area is completely surrounded, the players count their symbols surrounding the stars and the player with the most scores the number of stars as victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Decoratifs is an abstract card game for 2 players consisting of only 12 cards with art deco aesthetics.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into 4 quadrants, each quadrant contains 1 to 3 of either of two symbols in the game.  The players are trying to create areas of their connected symbols.  At game's end, each player compares their 3 largest areas, the player who has more large areas wins.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 6 rounds.  In each round, players play a card from their hands simultaneously. The cards are numbered from 1-12. The player with the lower number takes the first turn.  On your turn, you must place your card so that one of its corners overlaps the corner of a card in the &quot;grid.&quot; You may overlap up to 2 different cards. No card, however, may have more than 2 of its corners covered up.&#10;&#10;After playing a card, you replenish your hand by taking one of two face-up cards that were flipped at the start of the round. If you played first this round, you must take the higher numbered card.&#10;&#10;After all 12 cards have been added to the grid, players check their three largest areas and the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",
