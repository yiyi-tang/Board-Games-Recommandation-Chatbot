Save the other one to use later.&#10;3 Your opponent does the same. As your letters move together, you can form words with either player's letters.&#10;&#10;You score based on how far away from your home row the letters are, times the length of the word.  There are blank tiles and a special * tile, used to replace any letter.  The * tile can only be used by the player who owns it; the blanks can be used by either player.  There are a couple of other simple rules involving capture of letter tiles, but you get the idea.&#10;&#10;The board and pieces are made of hardwood and are laser engraved.

Keep rolling and moving until a six is showing on either die, or doubles other than ones are rolled.&#10;&#10;King of Battle:  Roll the dice.

Soon players will be able to buy companies like Alticor, Meijer and Steelcase while moving pieces shaped like local landmarks like Calder's La Grande Vitesse.&#10;&#10;The project was spearheaded by the Collegiate Entrepreneurs' Organization (CEO) at Grand Valley. Business sponsorships and sales of the game will raise funds to establish a CEO student scholarship at Grand Valley.&#10;The game board is patterned after the familiar Monopoly board, but it features prominent local businesses in the place of the original names. Boardwalk is Alticor, Park Place is Meijer, and Steelcase is Pacific Avenue (the three highest valued properties in the game). Other featured businesses are Behler-Young, Louis Padnos Iron and Metal Company, The Gilmore Collection, 1913 Room, Rockford Construction, Old Orchard, WZZM, Grand Valley State, Calvin College, and Aquinas College. The hotels will be shaped as the Amway Grand, and houses will represent the conservatory at the Frederick Meijer Gardens. Tokens will also be shaped as local attractions, such as the La Grande Vitesse, Leonardo Da Vinci Horse, John Ball statue, and other area landmarks.&#10;&#10;Full text availalble here:&#10;http://www.gvsu.edu/forms/ceo/Media/monopoly2.pdf&#10;&#10;Another article on the project may be found here:&#10;http://www.gvsu.edu/successstory/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.story&amp;id=FA32E53B-E926-4249-DCBD5FC17644C204&#10;&#10;",

While Operation Paukenschlag (an upcoming ATO game) began along the US East Coast at the same time (equally devastating), a handful of U-boats, Group Neuland, were ordered to deploy in the Caribbean.&#10;&#10;Unknown to most today, in 1942, the oil refineries at Aruba, Curacao, and Trinidad were vital in refining the oil arriving from Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela. Canada heavily relied on this oil, the US and England, also needed this oil for aviation fuel. For the Germans, it was a missed opportunity to really devastate the Allied oil and fuel production, which would have long lasting impact on the war.&#10;&#10;Game Details:&#10;&#10;System: Double Blind to capture the true flavor of submarine warfare (can be played solitaire), point to point movement&#10;&#10;Counters: 280 Map: One 11x17 inch depicting the Caribbean area south of Cuba&#10;&#10;Unique rules cover: Aircraft ASW radar, U-boat surface and sub-surface strengths and speeds, U-boat fuel limitations, Torpedo and U-boat surface attacks, Lake tankers, Cargo ships, B-18, A-20 bombers, Destroyers, ASW Ships, Landing saboteurs, Port Capacity.&#10;&#10;Unlike every submarine game made, this game forces both players to complete different objectives. For the German, it is to sink cargo and oil tankers in demanding quantities and or destroy oil refineries, depending on orders. The German must find and sink tankers with oil cargo moving to refineries. For the Allied player, they must move their oil and cargo ships across the map. Oil tankers must land at a refinery, unload the oil, refine it, reload it and then move the tanker off the map with the oil through U-boat infested water. Cargo ships with non-oil material must also cross the map. Of course, their other objective is to use their bombers and meager ASW force to sink U-boats!&#10;&#10;Available in both DTP and Print-n-Play&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A real 2-player game gem from the early post war days.&#10;&#10;Game consists of the game board, 20 tiny, hand painted tin locomotives in a pre-war design, a dice cup and a dice.&#10;&#10;Every player has 3 express trains (dark and light red), 3 passenger trains(dark and light green), 3 goods trains (dark and light blue) and a special train (yellow).&#10;&#10;Aim of the game is to send all your trains from the starting station to the end station on the opposite side of the board.&#10;Every kind of train has a fixed movement allowance: Expresses 4 squares, passengers 3 sq. and goods 2 sq.&#10;The die only shows how many of your trains you can move, which ones you take is for your own decision.&#10;If you pass on your throw you can move any given train one square back.&#10;&#10;The cracker of the game is the name-giving special train lurking in the backyard of your starting station: This can be triggered by your opponent !!!&#10;&#10;Once he has done this (or you have done this to him) by throwing a six at any time in the game (your choice), no one stops the special train.&#10;No matter what your throw is, the special train always moves six squares.&#10;So everyone off into the sideways - but these are shared with your opponent, and only one train can occupy a sideway at any time.&#10;&#10;Beware: If there is at any time the special train blocked by one of your own trains so it cannot move its 6 squares - you have lost the game...&#10;And if you think you have managed to avoid the yellow monster - it returns a second time !&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is one of the scarce Pepys boardgame editions.&#10;&#10;It came in two versions: One with separate board and small components box and one with a large box, containing board and components.&#10;&#10;Game consists of 54 playing pawns in 4 colours (small wooden cylinders), 3 sets of 4 movement cards (depicting one to four knights plus a Zero-knight card, and a large game board depicting a fictious medieval countryside.&#10;&#10;Aim is to capture the opponents capital, starting in your own at the opposite end of the board.&#10;&#10;At first you have to enter all your pawns onto the board square by square and then move the existing chain of knights towards the other capital.&#10;This is done with the randomly chosen movement cards. The number depicted is the allowance to move as many knights (pawns) from the end of your chain to the front of it.&#10;Obstacles hinder a smooth movement, and you can capture opponents knights or even cut his knights-chain off !&#10;For all these actions you have to show the right movement card, some actions require 4 knights.&#10;&#10;For the time edited (around 1950) a very good strategy game with much room for decision making what to do best with the random movement card. The beautifully designed gameboard adds to the atmosphere...&#10;&#10;",

Next time your move has to start from there, such restricting your further moves.&#10;Aim of the game is to go for the bonus cherries counting points at the end.&#10;You can earn them being the LAST one harvesting a tree or by being the one with the most cherries and leaves harvested from a certain tree.&#10;As the trees have three different sizes, there are different amounts of bonus cherries to gain.&#10;&#10;This is not a game for children, you have to twist your brain for the best moves !&#10;&#10;",

Move your ships. Fire your weapons. Launch your torpedoes. And watch your enemies explode into brilliant flashes of molten metal! Everything a budding megalomaniac... err, defender of the galaxy... could want!&#10;&#10;G.O.B.S.! is designed to allow you to build big, custom spacefleets and fight quick, explosive battles with simple rules and little or no record keeping. Just move, shoot, and (probably) explode. What could be more fun? Best of all, you can use G.O.B.S.! with any spaceship miniatures you like, from those expensive metal jobs to cheap plastic toys to scratch-built wonders made from household items. (Yours truly is contemplating a fleet made from seashells.)&#10;&#10;In G.O.B.S.!, a ship&rsquo;s speed and combat worthiness are determined by the size and apparent purpose of the miniature(or whatever the manufacturer happens to call the thing). Players may then customize the armament to reflect their preferences.&#10; Big ships are slow, clumsy, and easy to hit. They also carry lots and lots of weapons and are both very dangerous and hard to destroy.&#10;&#10;Smaller ships are fast and nimble, and very hard to hit. However, they carry few weapons and are very easy to destroy.&#10;&#10;The movement and combat systems of G.O.B.S.! are designed to reflect these general principles.&quot;&#10;&#10;Download G.O.B.S.! at:&#10;&#10;Homepage: http://www.thegobspage.com&#10;&#10;",

To assist you in your mission, Troubled Waters contains:&#10;- 40 new Ship Data Forms, from tiny patrol boats to a venerable aircraft carrier.&#10;- 10 new Aircraft Data Forms, from special operations helos to Mach 2 interceptors.&#10;- Missile and radar data for Soviet exported SA-2, SA-3, and SA-5 SAM systems.&#10;- Detailed carrier air wing compositions for 1986-1991 operations.&#10;&#10;In order to recreate the dramatic events of this period, Troubled Waters presents 10 new scenarios covering Middle East naval clashes from 1973 to the present day:&#10;- 1973 Arab-Israeli War&#10;- Iran-Iraq War, 1980&#10;- Persian Gulf Tanker War, 1984-88&#10;- &quot;Line of Death,&quot; 1986&#10;- US reprisals against Iran, 1988&#10;- Operation Desert Storm, 1991&#10;&#10;In addition, six scenario generators allow players to create and fight hypothetical battles with accurate forces from the coast of North Africa to the Strait of Hormuz.&#10;&#10;With Harpoon and Troubled Waters, the possibilities of the last 18 violent years of Middle East history are laid before you.

He lays down the house card, followed by all of the item cards he has except the maggots. He can either end his turn or place the maggot card and the Slimon monster card to prevent other players from claiming that stack with their monster (except it's still not safe from the one monster that can take over any house). Players earn points based on the objects in the claimed house; the first player to 100 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
