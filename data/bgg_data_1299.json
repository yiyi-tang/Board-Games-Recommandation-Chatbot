Players can gain further karma by landing on one of 4 different coloured life spaces (blue, green, red, and grey). You can use karma points to pay merit to other players and unlock evolution levels. But beware, losing all your karma points will send you back to purgatory.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round of turns all players enter karma negotiation where players can buy, sell and/or swap life space and evolution cards. After karma negotiation is completed the karma wheel is spun. Players with life space cards that match the colour spun receive merit (karma points) from other players.&#10;&#10;As you gain merit and life spaces in the game, you are ready for reincarnation to a new level of evolution. Evolution is achieved by acting, miming and pontificating the answers to questions from each of the corresponding evolution levels.&#10;&#10;Win the game by being the first to achieve all four levels of evolution, (plant, animal, human, monk), become a guru and answer, act or mime the ultimate enlightenment question!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After a successful heist. Divvying up the bounty is always a fight. Who gets the largest portion? All Hands In but who will emerge victorious? In Bandits wager, bluff, double-cross your former allies, and win great riches in this game of skill and strategy for 2-4 Players.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;All Blinks begin as Bandits, which swirl and pulse with their team color. Each player should take a single Bandit from the set of Blinks and set it to their chosen team color. Each time you double-click a Bandit, it will change team.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has a Bandit in their color, take another Bandit and triple-click it: this will transform it into a sparkling diamond. Place the Diamond in the center of the table, then begin the game.&#10;Gameplay (First Turn)&#10;Bandits is played in turns, with each turn broken into three phases: Bidding, Results, and Cleanup.&#10;Bidding&#10;Each player secretly bids a number between 1 and 3 on their Bandit. To do this, single-click your Bandit to see the current bid. Once it&rsquo;s revealed, you can single-click again to cycle through the three possible bids. A Bandit will automatically go back into its hidden state if you don&rsquo;t click it for 2 seconds.&#10;&#10;After everyone has chosen their bid, players take turns placing their Bandit onto the Diamond, starting with the first player and then going around the table clockwise. On the first turn, the player with the most money in their pockets goes first.&#10;&#10;On the first turn, all players will attach their Bandits directly to the Diamond. When a Bandit is correctly attached, the face touching the Diamond will sparkle white.&#10;Results&#10;After all Bandits have been attached, it&rsquo;s time to see the results. In Bandits, the highest unique bid is the winner. For example, if one player bids 3, another 2, and another 1, the player who bid 3 would be the winner. If, though, two players bid 3 and a third player only bids 1, the bid of 1 wins because it is the highest unique bid. If there is no highest unique bid, no player wins, and the turn moves immediately to cleanup.&#10;&#10;To see the results, double-click the Diamond, which will begin calculating. After a few seconds, the winning Bandit will sparkle with victory, then receive their points. A Bandit that steals directly from the Diamond receives a number of points equal to 6 minus their bid, so 3 points for a bid of 3, 4 for a bid of 2, and 5 for a bid of 1.&#10;Cleanup&#10;After the results have been handed out, the losing players remove their Bandit from the Diamond. The winning player, if there is one, leaves their Bandit on the Diamond, extending the board outward. That player retrieves a new Bandit from the pile and sets it to their team color, and bids first in the next round..&#10;Gameplay (Following Turns)&#10;After the first round, there will be at least one Bandit attached to the Diamond permanently. This Bandit will display the number of points it earned, and will sparkle like the Diamond on its outside edge. This extends the Diamond itself, and changes the way that players bid for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;During betting, instead of attaching to the Diamond itself, a player can place their Bandit onto the outside edge of the scored Bandit. They must attach directly opposite the Diamond, and their Bandit will sparkle as if attached to the Diamond itself to show that this was done correctly. Because they can only be attached in this way, the number of available faces is always 6, even after multiple Bandits are stacked outward.&#10;&#10;If a player wins a round by attaching to another Bandit, they also score differently. Instead of taking points directly from the Diamond, they steal points from the Bandit they attached to equal to half its points, rounded up. For instance, if you win a round while connected to a Bandit that had scored 3 points in a previous round, that Bandit would lose 2 points and you would gain 2. Points will only be stolen from the Bandit on the outside edge, meaning once a Bandit has been stolen from it will keep the remaining points for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;In a typical game of Bandits, players can only build out to a distance of 3 from the Diamond.&#10;Win Condition&#10;The game ends when no more bids can be made. This might be because there aren&rsquo;t enough Bandits left to play a full round, or because the Diamond has 3 scored Bandits attached to each face.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, each player adds up the points they scored on each of their scored Bandits. The player (or players) who scored the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;Long press any Blink to reset all connected Blinks back to unscored Bandits.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trifoil is a long-form, 2 player turn based strategy game in the vein of chess or go that can be played with 6 or more Blinks. Players take turns placing links, pushing them, and rotating sections of the board to try to build a long chain before their opponent can.&#10;The rules are flexible along with the initial board state, so the game can evolve to be simple, complex, or even just different depending on what you want to play!&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;The base board setup with 6 blinks is as follows:&#10;&#10;There are 2 players, red and blue. The board's background color is lit up with the current player's color. Each turn, players can use up to 2 actions (see available actions), except for the first turn of the game where a player can only use one action.&#10;A player wins when they have a chain of 5 links of their own color! The game also ends when either player has placed 9 links, in which case the player with the longest chain wins (see end game rules).&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;On the first turn of the game, the player going first only gets 1 action. Every turn afterwards each player gets 2 actions. Note: You cannot make a move which returns the board to the previous board state.&#10;Place a link&#10;You can place a link by first clicking the blink you wish to place on, then clicking the blink touching the face (direction) where want to place the link&#10;&#10;This means that you can't place any links facing outwards from the formation.&#10;Spin&#10;You can disconnect, rotate, and reattach one of 3-blink triangles that form the corners of the board as one of your actions. They are labelled &quot;&Delta;&quot;, &quot;&Omega;&quot;, and &quot;&theta;&quot; in the board above!&#10;Players are allowed to do this ONLY if they have less links on that triangle than their opponents. This is referred to as the &quot;minority rule.&quot; If they have the same amount of links as the opponent, they cannot spin it.&#10;&#10;Push&#10;You can push a link outwards from a Blink the using the same input as placing a link. E.g. if you attempt to place a link where a link already exists, you will instead push it--pushing any other links in the way in a straight line as well! You can only push links of your own color.&#10;&#10;Ending your turns&#10;Once you have made your moves, double click any Blink to commit a move and pass the turn to the other player&#10;&#10;Win Condition&#10;Be the first to create a chain of at least 5 links. Only 2 links to Blinks are counted toward the final score. Scale chain length according to amount of Blinks (see below)&#10;&#10;Variations&#10;The rulebook and the board are flexible, so use your imagination--the possibilities are endless! See Examples below&#10;Rule Variations&#10;Try limiting number the total number of links you can place to . If either player runs out of links, the player with the longest chain wins.&#10;Try playing until any one Blink is filled with 6 links of any color. When that happens, the longest chain wins.&#10;Try playing with 3 moves instead of 2! You might need to increase the winning chain length.&#10;Removing the limit of links that a Blink can contribute to a chain creates a much more defensive game!&#10;&#10;",

If she forgets to draw a card before the next player plays, she must play the rest of the round with only two cards.

In modern times, the diamond patterns can be seen on sweaters, socks, hats, and a multitude of other options for clothing as well as design. There are even argyle prints on furniture and home decor.&#10;&#10;The most modern though finds this brand new roll and write game named for the argyle pattern. In Argyle, players are creating effectively a tile-type layout by filling in colors that match their dice rolls. Two of the columns are strictly white as to allow the players a barrier between their colors.&#10;&#10;Each round will find the player having to cleverly position their new dice and color they have gained so they continue the pattern on their player sheet. The more readily a pattern can be ascertained, the more points a player will earn.&#10;&#10;Unlike other pattern games such as Azul, players are more free to place their colors as they choose. Though such choices can be tricky! In order to have the best pattern by games&rsquo; end, the players will be modifying dice and working through strategies that will put them on top of the heap.&#10;&#10;The puzzly nature of this game will be inviting and comfortable for sudoku fans as well as players who enjoy games with spatial elements.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deep in the Hexenwood, four powerful tree spirits fight an endless war to control the forest. Take control of one of these spirits, then engage in a strategic, turn based battle. By the end, one tree will come to dominate the forest - are you wise enough to prevail?&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;First, build the forest with however many Blinks you&rsquo;d like, and in any shape you want. The larger the forest, the longer the game will take. Below are some examples of typical setups for 12, 18, and 24 Blinks.&#10;&#10;Once you&rsquo;re happy with your setup, click any Blink to plant your starting Trees. Single click a Tree to change its species. Each player should choose a different species of Tree and a unique starting position on opposite ends of the forest. There are four species of tree, each with a unique color and leaf pattern.&#10;&#10;Hexenwood is a very flexible game, and can be set up in many different ways. For instance, you can begin a game with each player having multiple starting Trees, or even with some players having more than others. This can be helpful for players with mismatched skill levels.&#10;&#10;After you plant your starting trees, double-click any Blink to start the game. When mapping is complete, the game begins.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Hexenwood is a turn-based game. The board will show which player&rsquo;s turn it is by pulsing their Trees. If it is your turn, single-click one of your Trees to activate it. Only trees that can make valid moves can be activated.&#10;&#10;When a Tree is activated, the board will display all of the moves it can make. There are two ways of moving: Spreading and Jumping.&#10;&#10;SPREADING&#10;Unclaimed positions adjacent to your Tree will be fully illuminated. If you click it, you will plant a Tree in that spot, and you will capture any neighboring Trees controlled by other players. This is the safest way to expand your territory.&#10;&#10;JUMPING&#10;Unclaimed positions that are one space away from your tree will show a bright pattern. If you click one of these Blinks, you can Jump to that spot. The Tree you jumped from will uproot itself and take over the new area, also capturing any neighboring Trees controlled by other players. This is a slightly risky way to expand because it leaves holes in your territory.&#10;&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve made your move, the game will automatically move to the next player&rsquo;s turn. If a player has no Trees that can make a valid move, their turn will be skipped and the game will move to the next player immediately.&#10;&#10;Importantly, you cannot rearrange the board during gameplay. If a Blink is removed from the field, the game will pause and the faces that are missing neighbors will flash. You must return them to their original positions to resume the game.&#10;&#10;If at any point during the game you wish to restart and go back to setup, triple-click any Blink.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION&#10;When no players can make a valid move, or if there is only one player remaining with Trees in the forest, the game ends. The entire forest will flash white, then reveal the winning player. All Trees controlled by the winning player will flash rapidly, and all other Blinks will revert to an empty forest floor.&#10;&#10;",

These will be renamed from their MBR counterparts, as we want to hew as close to Robert E. Howard's texts as possible.&#10;- 15+ Hero Sheets associated with the Mythic Battles: Ragnar&ouml;k miniatures.&#10;- 10 new cards (equipment and spells), appropriate for the northern reaches of Nordheim.&#10;&#10;-description from Kickstarter page&#10;&#10;",

Panzerschiff is an introductory-level tactical WW2 naval wargame for two players.  &#10;Famous battleships, battlecruisers, pocket battleships, heavy cruisers, and light cruisers from eight nations are maneuvered into combat, and fire their guns (or launch torpedoes) to sink enemy ships.&#10;&#10;Panzerschiff Expansion &amp; Cruiser Module Set contains both of these add-ons, in one package:&#10;&#10;     Panzerschiff Expansion comes with booklet with rule additions, set of 96 new warships and ship logs, and Reference Card.  &#10;     Panzerschiff Cruiser Module comes with booklet with rules additions, set of 96 heavy and light cruisers and ship logs, and Reference Card. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The game uses a system based on the system used in Avalon Hill's Bismarck (1st ed.), except with additions and refinements.  &#10;You may replay historical or design-your-own WW2 scenarios.&#10;&#10;Warships are rated in a variety of categories:  bow main guns, stern main guns, port &amp; starboard secondary guns, speed, armor, engineering, fire control, vulnerability to plunging fire, and more.  &#10;Players can look at a ship counter and its log sheet, and immediately determine its strengths and weaknesses.&#10;&#10;The Panzerschiff game system is low complexity, and will appeal to novices or younger players, as well as to naval game vets who opt for the advanced rules that emphasize fun as well as authenticity.&#10;&#10;With the standard game and this set, you will have all the significant warships of WW2 to play with.

    "Description": "BoxOff is a solo abstract strategy game. It rises above the level of a mere puzzle because of its random set-up and user-defined board size.  The random set-up makes it like a playing-card solitaire game.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a rectangular board of any size, as long as it has an even number of squares.  7x8, 8x12, and 12x15 are common sizes.  The board is filled with stones or marbles in various colors.  For an easy game, use 3 colors.  For a game of medium difficulty, use 4 colors.  For a difficult game use 5 colors. There must be an even number of each color, because they're going to be removed in pairs.  Typically you would use an equal number of each color.&#10;&#10;A pair of stones of the same color may be removed from the board if the pair define opposite corners of a rectangle that contains no other stones.  They could be in a line (a 1xn rectangle) or diagonal corners of a non-linear rectangle.  The goal is to remove all the stones.&#10;&#10;This game was first described in Games Magazine in 2013, and later in the Abstract Games magazine in 2020.  There have been electronic versions for iOS and Android.  BoxOff is now being published by NewVenture Games in three versions: a board game, peg game, and travel-size.&#10;&#10;",

During the day, players travel around the magical city of Elysia to work towards one of two main objectives: accumulating energy at The Origin, or banishing opponents from the council. Both are accomplished through voting, so securing the trust and cooperation of other players is key to victory. Players can also draw and play spells or magical artifacts to gain a strategic advantage.&#10;&#10;At night, players further their agendas by Mindwalking one of their opponents. Mindwalks are issued by passing written commands to the victim, hidden from their opponents' view. These commands are open ended and completely up to the player's imagination!&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player or faction completes their hidden win condition. Will you be the one pulling the strings over the council, or will you end up dancing to someone else's tune? Control your opponents. Control destiny.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kit is an easy to learn game and fun for the avid card player or if you're a beginner. Rummy style game where you make kits or runs, make the right combinations, and be the first to go out - then watch your opponents scramble to cut their losses. The goal of the game is to be the player with the lowest score at the end of the 10th round by making your entire hand into kits and/or runs.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two 44-card decks. Each deck has four WILD cards and four colors: Blue, Gold, Green, and Purple. Each color has ten cards, 3 through 12. Wild cards can be considered any number or color that you wish. There are also rotating wild cards that change every round. The rotating wild cards depend on the number of cards dealt that round. When 3 cards are dealt, the 3&rsquo;s are wild, when 4 cards are dealt the 4&rsquo;s are wild and so on until the last round when the 12&rsquo;s are wild.&#10;&#10;A kit is three or more cards of the same number and can be any color. You can have as many wild cards in a kit as you want. A run is three or more consecutive cards of the same color. A wild card can replace any card in a run. You can have as many wild cards in a run as you want and they can be adjacent to one another.&#10;&#10;Dealing: &#10;1. Shuffle both decks of cards together. &#10;2. For the first round deal 3 cards to each player, dealing one card at a time. Note: For each round of play, the number of cards dealt increases by one card. In the second round 4 cards are dealt, in the third round 5 cards are dealt, and so on until dealing 12 cards to each player in the final round. The dealer position rotates after each round. &#10;3. Place the remaining cards in the center of the table and turn over the top card. The stack of cards is the draw pile and the card turned up is the start of the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Playing: &#10;1. The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play continues clockwise. &#10;2. Start your turn by taking the top card on the discard pile or drawing a card. &#10;3. Complete your turn by discarding one card. &#10;4. Continue to make kits and/or runs until you are able to go out. &#10;5. Going out: Once all of the cards in your hand are part of a kit or run, lay down all of your cards face up on the table before discarding your last card. &#10;Note: you must be able to make kits and runs from the exact number of cards dealt in the round. You must have one card left to discard. You can go out on your very first turn. &#10;6. Once a player has gone out, all other players have one final turn. Start your turn as normal and after discarding, lay down your kits and runs. Any cards that do not fit in a kit or run will count toward your score. &#10;7. The cards that are in kits and runs do not count toward your score. Players add up only their unused cards. The card values are equal to the number on the card and Wild cards are worth 20 points. The player that goes out first gets a score of -5. The scorekeeper records and adds up the score for each player. &#10;8. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left shuffles all of the cards and deals the next round. &#10;Note: Increase the number of cards dealt by one card and keep track of the rotating Wild cards&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pigeons are surrounding the hamburger! &#10;A game in which pigeons fight over a hamburger and are mixed up.&#10;&#10;You will receive 6 pigeon cards of your color. Take out the boss pigeon and place it in the middle.&#10;&#10;Alternately &quot;issue pigeon cards&quot; or &quot;move pigeon cards&quot; from the first player.&#10;&#10;To &quot;put out&quot;, select one pigeon card you have and place it so that it touches your pigeon card in the field with &quot;sides&quot; or &quot;corners&quot;. However, it cannot be placed in a place where it touches the opponent's boss.&#10;&#10;In the case of &quot;move&quot;, move your pigeon card so that it touches your or your opponent's pigeon card with &quot;sides&quot; or &quot;corners&quot;. After moving, you can touch the opponent's boss by &quot;side&quot;.&#10;&#10;If you repeat your turn alternately, the number of pigeon cards in the field will increase and spread. However, there is a limit to the &quot;size&quot; of this game. The size of the card that can be placed is &quot;vertical and horizontal, only up to 4 pigeon cards&quot;. Areas larger than four are treated as &quot;walls&quot; and cards cannot be taken out or moved.&#10;&#10;You win the game if the opponent's boss pigeon's card is vertically and horizontally surrounded by 4 squares. The pigeon cards do not have to be your own pigeon card, so make good use of the opponent's pigeon cards and the 4x4 wall to enclose the boss pigeon to win the

    "Description": "Mathematicus is used in three different modes: basic, normal and advanced. &#10;The board is the same, but different elements are used in each mode such as specific dice, tokens, cards and tools. &#10;The game in basic mode has simplified rules compared to the other two modes.&#10;Another interesting aspect of Mathematicus is that it can be played simultaneously in different modes by different players, each of which answers questions suited to his level of knowledge.&#10;&#10;in basic mode Mathematicus has the structure of a &quot;goose game&quot;, that is, dice are rolled and progressed along a path made of spaces, in each of which one is called to carry out certain actions or have benefits or penalties. In Mathematicus two different dice are used, the tetrahedral die (4 faces) and the dodecahedral die (12 faces), leaving the player to choose from time to time which one to use.&#10;&#10;You advance along the path by answering the questions (of the level chosen) posed by the cards. Questions must be answered within the indicated times.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game: to collect as many figures of famous mathematicians as possible, even taking them away from other players, (using the &quot;Fields Medal&quot; or event card) but you cannot have two figures of the same mathematician.&#10;&#10;In advanced mode the game allows you to become familiar with ancient calculation tools (Napier's Sticks and the Calculator Rule), with interesting numbering systems used by various civilizations of the past, and also with binary calculation, essential in the current world of electronics and information technology.&#10;&#10;Extracted translation from the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Antonio Vivaldi would have composed the oratory Juditha triunphans devicta Holofernis barbarie to celebrate this great victory.&#10;&#10;In Corf&ugrave; 1716 you will find 12 Venetian combat units, divided into 6 German Mercenary units, 3 Italian infantry units and 3 Ultramarine infantry and 20 Ottoman combat units, divided into 4 Janissaries units, 9 Kapikulu infantry and 7 auxiliary Serhaddkulu units representing the regiments and units employed during the siege. &#10;There are two Morale chits for a total of 34 pieces, 2 d6s, a map, 9 Special Event Cards and the rules.&#10;&#10;The map represents the area where the battle took place; it is used to register the orders and the consistency of the two armies. &#10;The map is divided into Area, where to deploy the units and where the actions take place during the 20 turns. &#10;There are the Combat Tables, with the result of the Combat and the Morale Track, which registers the Morale level of the two armies and the Turn Table.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
