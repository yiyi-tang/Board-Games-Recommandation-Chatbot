The deck has cards numbered 1-8. There is one, 1, two 2 and so forth until you get to eight 8.&#10;&#10;On your turn, draw a card from the deck, add it to your hand, and then reveal and place a card from your hand in front of you. You can place up to 3 cards face up in front of you and you cannot put them back into your hand.&#10;&#10;Form melds using a total of 6 cards comprised of the cards in your hand and the cards placed in front of you. The winner is determined by comparing the melds, but you may be able to win by bluffing even without forming melds.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#132;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#189;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#186;&#187;&#233;&#155;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#183;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#189;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#175;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#152;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#230;&#167;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#141;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#230;&#143;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#174;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher summary&#10;&#10;",

In This Latest Expansion, Obsidius Mallex Has Gained Control Of A Portion Of The Alien Space Station&rsquo;s Apocalyptic Power, And Now Threatens To Bring It To Bear Against His Foes. Before, You Were Battling For Treasure &ndash; Now, You&rsquo;re Fighting For Survival.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Like the Dreaded Ambull before it, Escalation offers a new quest for Blackstone Fortress. However, the quest for the sinister Black Shrines offers new twists on the core gameplay of Warhammer Quest and promises to be a challenge for even the most seasoned pack of adventurers.&#10;&#10;You won&rsquo;t be going in alone, however. Escalation brings four new Explorers to the game (and one very loyal Servitor!), offering you new options for your adventures and allowing you to own some iconic characters in plastic, like an Adeptus Ministorum Crusader and Primaris Psyker. Escalation will be the first time fans outside of the USA and Germany can get their hands on these models (if you&rsquo;re in the USA or Germany, you&rsquo;ll also be able to track them down in the Combat Arena game).&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s not just the good guys getting some reinforcements, but the Servants of the Abyss, with a brand new set of cultists, led by a literal Firebrand. These guys feature a more occult and barbarous aesthetic than their Traitor Guard brethren from the main set, helping shed some light on the dizzying diversity of the Slaves to Darkness.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Egg Farmer is a simple but fun family-friendly game which involves the collection of eggs in a 'basket pile'. Players take turns drawing from the Egg Deck, building up eggs in hand which can be banked in the basket pile or spent on a Farm Deck card, which will defend against the foxes which appear in the Egg Deck. Hungry foxes eat your chickens and thieving foxes steal eggs in hand. Only banked eggs are safe and will be counted up at the end. The last-person standing collects unbanked eggs from other players and adds them to their total.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Everyone wants their car on the podium. And everyone has different favorites. Who pushes them forward without the others noticing? Who leaves his opponents behind and gets their car on the podium?&#10;&#10;Set-Up&#10;Before the game starts, players get three cards each. Each card shows one of the 5 cars and what place that car has to finish to score you points. &#10;All players decide simultaneously which two cards they will keep. All in secret of course! Now that everyone has decided what car they are (secretly) rooting for, you're off to the races.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;On their turn a player rolls 3 dice from the pool. They then have to allocate one die each to two different racing stalls and discard the last die. Once there are two identical symbols in any given stall, that car is moving forward and the dice are returned.&#10;&#10;How far the car is moving is determined by its actual position on the track. A car in first place for example is moved only one space forward, a car in fourth place is moved four spaces accordingly. You only count individual rows containing 1 or more cars. If for example 4 cars are tied for first place the last car is considered to be in second place for this purpose.&#10;&#10;Splash - the mud hole&#10;If a car ends its movement in the mud hole it gets stuck. It needs 3 identical symbols before it can leave.&#10;&#10;The finish line&#10;Any car that reaches the checkered area is placed on the podium according to its finish.&#10;Once 4 cars have reached the finish line it's time to see who takes home the trophy. All cards are revealed and players now score points. If that car has finished exactly as the card demands (1st/2nd/3rd) you score 4 points. If it came one in one place too late you still score 2 points. If it came in too early or too late, you score no points.&#10;Whoever manages to score the most points with their two cars wins and is crowned the King of Caracho.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Signal experimental wargame is a three-player, turn-based strategy game designed to study decision-making concerning the use of conventional and nuclear weapons. The research objective is to explore how weapons capabilities shape player behavior and the resulting impacts on strategic stability and the potential for escalation in a crisis. The board game serves as both a source of experimental data and a testing ground for the ruleset and game dynamics that were subsequently built into the SIGNAL online platform.&#10;&#10;In SIGNAL, players choose courses of action that a hypothetical nation might follow, using economic, military, and diplomatic means. Players may choose to cooperate with or compete against the other players in the virtual world to grow their infrastructure and gain resources while avoiding loss of home territory to conventional militarized invasions or nuclear war. The game proceeds in rounds, with players maneuvering their forces within a map-based environment.&#10;&#10;Players work simultaneously, often negotiating agreements such as trade deals or military alliances, and &ldquo;signal&rdquo; to others by placing tokens on hexes (units of land or water). The signaling token is accompanied by the staging of cards (face down) that reflect actions like building cities, sending troops to neutral territories, or engaging in military operations, including the use of conventional or nuclear arms. There is a price associated with signaling; players pay for each card placed, regardless of whether the capability is exercised to reflect the &ldquo;costly signaling&rdquo; or &ldquo;credible commitments&rdquo; in the existing theoretical literature on deterrence. Players may then exercise their staged actions, but only at locations where signaling tokens were previously placed.&#10;&#10;During this action phase, players take a series of turns, starting with a randomly chosen player to ensure that any given player does not have a constant first-mover advantage. After five rounds, players are ranked on a relative scale based on their infrastructure, resources, and territorial integrity to determine the winner&mdash;with a player&rsquo;s cumulative performance captured on a leaderboard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If you arrive at a dig site, you can try to dig up a CD by rolling over the dig number for the region. Some dig sites will end up being duds with no CDs at all, and if you find a CD the value of them varies.&#10;&#10;In order to get an advantage over the other treasure hunters, you need to decide when to use special powers to mitigate the effects of luck.

The earlier discoveries of minerals and oil by Shell and Standard Oil prompted both companies to pursue these objectives in concordance with the Bolivian government through the Chaco desert area. For Bolivia, access to the Atlantic would allow pro-jected oil pipelines to the Paraguay River to be built and allow for com-merce.&#10;&#10;The three day battle ended with the Bolivians surrounding but failing to seize Nanawa due to growing Paraguayan resistance (the Bolivians had no reserves), eventually both sides returned to their starting positions by the end of the third day.

Each champion has three attributes: a class, an element, and a type of arms, all imbued with incredible power. When one champion is attacked by another, the damage they take exposes the nature of their attributes, revealing the weakened champion's true form to the other players. However, once these attributes have been revealed, the champion who wields them can start to benefit from their abilities.&#10;&#10;In order to win, you have to reveal the right card at the right time while not giving your opponents the opportunity to do the same. In the team match you also have to figure out who your allies are before the other teams do. Be the last one standing &mdash; or the only team still in the game &mdash; to win.&#10;&#10;",

Designed by young professionals in the conservation workspace, the game is designed to mimic real-life stakeholder relationships, introduce some of Malaysia's most iconic marine species, and highlight threats to coral reefs. The game goes along two tracks: nature and development.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player chooses one of six roles (conservationist, developer, natural resource manager, tourism operator, politician and fisherman) at random. Each role is assigned three specific missions to achieve in the game which corresponds to priorities in real life. For example, all three of the conservationist's priorities are related to nature while the tourism operator is interested in both nature and development.&#10;&#10;Seven cards are distributed to each player. The building up of the game revolves around a &quot;rock&quot; card where players build in either the nature track or the development track (level 1 to level 4). To win the game, players have to play all three specific mission cards (level 5) on the board. However, since some priorities overlap, players have to communicate, work together, or even sabotage to place their best cards on the table. Sabotage comes in the form of scenario cards that thwart the advancement of a track.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ascension of the Galaxy is the rich, maneuver-based spaceship combat game where thinking ahead is not an option. Plenty of decisions have to be made every turn.&#10;&#10;Although this is a print-and-play game, you could easily use your own space mat with a hex-grid and miniatures to use making for a beautiful gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Think Ahead ... or Perish!&#10;&#10;Command in AotG takes more thought than considering what target to shoot at. Players must think of such variables as:&#10;&#10;&#10;     &quot;What shield is facing my opponent after we move?&quot;&#10;     &quot;My ship can't power everything - what systems are essential this turn?&quot;&#10;     &quot;My ship is getting beat up. Should I start charging the hyperdrive now?&quot;&#10;     &quot;I want my ship over there, but will turning the ship now put me at an extreme disadvantage next turn?&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;A Maneuver-Based Game&#10;&#10;The ships in AotG do not turn on a dime (with one exception). When ships turn, they are committed to moving forward a distance before they can turn again.&#10;&#10;Players look for ways to take advantage of this because not only are ships weaker from the rear, ships also cannot fire behind them (with one exception).&#10;&#10;Unique Ships = Unique Tactics&#10;&#10;One of the key strengths of Ascension of the Galaxy is that each of the six races are vastly different from one another. Not just with weapons and armor, but how they power systems, take damage, and even how they enter hyperspace. Each race feels truly alien making for interesting tactics and gameplay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Cars can use the ramps if they are moving fast enough. Using the ramps lets you pass other cars and move more efficiently, so managing your hand of speed cards to take advantage of them is crucial.&#10;&#10;&bull; Savanna Stretch features wild animals that traverse the track, blocking the way. They move ahead after a car passes them, making the track more difficult to navigate for the lead car, and opening up for the trailing cars, so it can pay to hang back a bit before making your move.&#10;&#10;These new tracks add a little more strategy to the game, offering Downforce veterans a whole new play experience.&#10;&#10;",

Her success at the front has been costly for her family. The Party has ordered that more bears are needed at the front and can think of no better reinforcement than Oxna&rsquo;s own cubs. Hoping she has bestowed some of her fighting strength to her offspring, the Hero Kommissar leading the Ursine Special Services Recruitment program, has recruited Oxna&rsquo;s cubs to join the fight. Oxna is not going to let the horrors of battle reach her offspring. In this, our first expansion for Front Line No Komrades, OXNA BEARS ALL.&#10;&#10;Oxna Bears All is a brilliant new expansion for the hit card game Front Line &ndash; No Komrades.&#10;&#10;Oxna continues the  fast-paced card game of survival, but offers new expansive play possibilities, including a cooperative campaign and alternative &ldquo;missions&rdquo; for the rag-tag group of conscripts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stock Market&ndash; stock exchange board game&#10;&#10;- a business world strategy game&#10;&#10;- large, rollable gaming mat, easy to care&#10;- new way to play: no dice needed (option)&#10;If they believe, they&rsquo;ve see everything in the field of financial strategy games, here comes absolutely revolutionary way to play. Realistic, easy to play, but not too simple. Stock Exchange business is not that easy in real life also. No need for paper or other memo materials. Playing could be just as intensive and stress loaded as real life stock broker life, while waiting for the profits to come and still everything could collapse in a moment.&#10;The game suits best for the advanced players over 10 years old. It&rsquo;s a demanding product for those, who likes to dive into parallel universe of game&#10;&#10;The Idea&hellip;&#10;Stock Market is a reality game following the rules of stock exchange world, where assets increase is mostimportant. In this game the Players are both: brokers and investors. The Bank sells tokens used forinvesting. As in real stock market, the idea is to buy low and sell high. The rates change every turn, eachPlayers can make one or multiplied exchanges on own turn. Dice can be used to play, but usually StockMarket is played with finger marks, that determine the rate vectors. The duration of one game can bedefined by players, e.g. 40 or 60 min. The person to make most of their capital within the agreed timebrackets is the winner.ATTENTION: Dramatic turns in the body of the game can cause stress symptoms when taken too seriously.It was our goal to make this game as real as possible following stock exchange ups and lows dramas.Anyway, this is a virtual reality only. Relax and enjoy!&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;To begin:Roll open Lite Lion Games rollable Stock market gaming mat. Place violet rate detectors to the mid-space, marked &ldquo;0&rdquo;. At least two players are recommended to be on the opposite side of eachother/other side of the table to make the finger marks drawing easier. The Players choose own colourfrom the four colours available. Each Player gets 5 pcs tokens of the corresponding colour, each ofnominal value of LL$400 of investment, and LL$2320 cash. The cash money is issued as following: 1 pcsLL$1000, 6 pcs LL$100, 9 pcs LL$50, 9 pcs LL$20 and 9 pcs LL$10. The investment tokens can beexchanged to cash in the Bank as equal to LL$400 each.The beginner can be chosen in any suitable way, as coin draw and etc. In according to the sequence ofturns, each Player has equal amount of turns per game.&#10;&#10;The Turn&#10;&#10;The Rate:For each turn two Players draw the number. The number is counted together on fingers of two Playersat once: The Player, whose turn in on and any other Player as agreed. The hand is hidden behind theback or under the table and when released, the amount 0-5 can be shown on fingers (as pictured). Thegross number on both Players&rsquo; hands valued 1-10 is the number of the share to move. It can go up or&#10;&#10;down. The violet indicator is moved one step up to down to show the quote of the particular share.The position of the palm is important: if both Players&rsquo; palm is facing down, the rate decreases, otherwisethe rate increases. If both Players shows zero, the rate of each share 1-10 decreases one level. If bothPlayers show same even number, the vector of each even number share (2,4,6,8,10) is moved one step.If both Players show same odd number, the vector of each odd number share (1,3,5,7,9) is moved onestep.ATTENTION: Step and Level enjoy different relevancy. Step is one space on the rate indicator vector,when Level is a grade on the vertical vector.&#10;&#10;Changing the Rates with Dice:The Player of the upcoming turn throws one of dice first. Numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 increase the Rate by onestep. Numbers 1 and 2 decrease the Rate by one step. Then the Players throw two dice. The grossnumber is the number of the Share, which goes up or down. The violet Rate Indicator is moved one stepforward or back. If dice return gross number 12, all the Shares 2-11 decrease one level. If both dicereturn with same even number, the vector of each even number Share (2,4,6,8,10) is moved one step. .If both dice return with same odd number, the vector of each odd number Share (1,3,5,7,9) is movedone step.ATTENTION: Step and Level enjoy different relevancy. Step is one space on the rate indicator vector,when Level is a grade on the vertical vector. When played with dice,Shares are marked with numbers 2-11, so Share #1 equals with number11 on dice. Dice gross number 12 is equal to zero on fingers. Otherwisethe instructions are same.&#10;&#10;Quotation changes:Quotation changes after each Trade (buy/sell) event except the firstinvestment round. As the Asset is invested, the Quotation Indicator ismoved a step forward. As the Asset is released (the Shares are sold out),the quotation indicator moves a step back. The changes take place afterthe trade event is completed. The quotation always moves one stepdespite the value of the trade event. The Quotation Indicator moves asillustrated considering steps 1-7. The horizontal step does not changethe rate. When moving downwards, the Indicator moves same, but inthe opposite direction. When Rate Level changes, the Indicator goes over green or red line.&#10;&#10;Exchange:As Exchange Rate changes, the Player completes the Trade. Each Turn allows to make multiple Trades(Buy/Sell Events). The Player invests one or more Units into the chosen Enterprise. One non-recurringinvestment nominal value is $400.&#10;Investment Purchase Rate:&#10;If the Rate Indicator is in zero space (&ldquo;0&rdquo;), the Investment is in its nominal value of $400. &#10;If the RateIndicator is e.g. +20, the Investor has to pay $400+$20=$420&hellip;..&#10;If the Rate is e.g. -60, the Investment is $60 below the nominal value, so they can get a $60 refund from the Bank or buy the shares for $400-$60=$340.&#10;&#10;The Investment token is placed to the same space with the Rate Indicator.Investment Sales Rate&#239;&#129;&#182; ProfitIf the Investment Token is in e.g. in space &ldquo;0&rdquo; (zero) and Rate Indicator is in space &ldquo;+40&rdquo;, the Investmentis evaluated $400+$40. So, the Investor gets $40 profit. NOTE: When selling shares out, the investedsum is not refunded to the Bank but stays in the possession of the Investor (the Player). The Investorgets interest from the Bank $40 for each invested unit. (?)&#239;&#129;&#182; Lost&#10;If the Investment token is in space &ldquo;-20&rdquo; and the Rate is &ldquo;-60&rdquo;, the Player&rsquo;s Investment is $40 below purchase price, so when selling, the Investor has to pay $40 to the Bank for each Invested Unit. So, the Player gains a loss of $40. The Investment token returns to its nominal value of $400 after this action.Exchange commissionThe Exchange charges a commission for each assignment. Each Investment Unit placed into Shares isdue to the brokerage of $10.&#10;&#10;Rate Development&#10;Top Rate&#10;Reaching its top value, the Rate development stops. Getting a raise claim, while enjoying the top rateposition, the Rate collapse three levels down, e.g. from level +120 to level +60.&#10;Bottom Rate&#10;Reaching its bottom value, the Rate development gets out of control. Getting a reduce claim, whileenjoying the bottom rate position, the Share turns valueless and all the Investment have to be returnedto the Bank without reimbursement. This action forces the Rate back to zero level.&#10;&#10;Trades Between Investors&#10;The Players are allowed to trade Shares/Investments between each other. The trades occur accordingthe Rate levels. Reciprocal trading is not due to commissions, neither it influences the Rate. The buyerplaces their Investment token instead of the Seller&acute;s ones, and the Seller&rsquo;s tokens are returned to theBank. The Bank does not pay for the tokens as they are paid by the Buyer. The price can be also agreedin-between the parties, as in some cases singular Investor for particular Share is an advantage.&#10;&#10;The Winner&#10;The game is over when the agreed time period is full. As the Investments are liquidated, the Player who gains the biggest capital is the winner. The game is also over, if every Share&rsquo;s Rate is in its top value. Thiscondition also enforces Investments&rsquo; liquidation.DurationDuration of one game round is subject to the number of Players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Race your small spacefaring trade vessel across the galaxy cleverly plan your course of the choices routes to reach the most valuable worlds while earning travel fees along vital navigation routes. Once a player has built all their bases the game ends and winner will be the one outmaneuver their rivals with more bases on sets of planets and in the longest interconnected route.&#10;&#10;Overview of Play:&#10;Moving through or ending a turn on a planet provides one resource cube of the matching color. Each base built on a planet is worth victory points totaled at the end of the game. Different planet colors have different values and some permit special actions. Bonus points are earned for having bases on matching planet colors as well as on sets of all three colors. Additionally, special crew members granting players unique actions can be purchased by spending resource cubes at the starting home-world tile.&#10;&#10;When the final planet tile has been placed and that player has taken their final turn actions, the game immediately ends and scoring takes place. The winner will be the player who accumulated the most points from building sets of planetary bases. The longest connected route along interstellar navigation lines also scores a bonus and bases on rarer planet colors are worth more than common ones. The player who triggers the end of the game by placing their final base also earns 1 additional bonus point for doing so. When a player is down to just a single base, as a courtesy they should announce it to the other players.&#10;&#10;Players move their trade vessels between stars and planets along navigation routes carefully collecting resources along the way to spend on building planetary bases.&#10;Both ending a turn with your ship on a planet, or just passing through the planet on your travels, provides one resource cube of the matching color &mdash;either grey, red, or blue.&#10;Each base built on a planet is worth commerce points totaled at the end of the game. But beware, building where other players already have a base costs extra and just passing through a planet with another player&rsquo;s base provides them travel fees!&#10;&#10;Points are earned immediately when a base is built on a planet. Each additional base the player might later build one the planet also scores points. But a player cannot build two of their bases directly on top of one another. They can only build another base at the same planet when it will go on top of another player&rsquo;s base.&#10;Special planets &mdash;purple, yellow, orange&mdash; offer unique actions such as exchanging resources or earning extra resource cubes. On certain planets crew members can also be hired that offer special actions to improve movement, exploration, trade, or builds.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Space Tiles - 1 start tile, 15 stellar tiles, 3 blue planets, 3 red planets, 3 gray planets, 2 yellow planets, 1 purple planet, 1 orange planet, 1 green planet, 1 nebula, 1 supernova, 1 wormhole.&#10;5 player trade ships in five colors - blue, red, green, purple, yellow.&#10;25 Resources Cubes in three colors - grey, red, blue.&#10;Base Markers - 8 base markers in the five player colors.&#10;5 scoring markers - (identical to the player base markers) &#10;1 Score Board&#10;20 Crew Member cards&#10;1 Rulebook&#10;&#10;",
