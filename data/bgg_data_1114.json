    "Description": "Royal 9 Dice Poker Game is a roll and score dice party game for 1-6 players where the object of the game is to not only score specific target dice combinations for points but to also outrank your opponents scored target hands to earn even more points. The game uses a 6 dice, 5 suit Poker style layout and a special &quot;Royal&quot; die that adds additional scoring possibilities and mechanics. The scoring scales proportionately when adding more players to remain balanced and has a special rules set for playing solo games. This game's primary objective is to reduce the luck factor commonly found in most dice scoring party games and add more strategy and decision making mechanics found in games like Poker or Rummy while still maintaining the thrill of chance and the social fun of dice party games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There are 3 kinds of cards in the deck:&#10;&#10;1) Pictures of signs, packages, menus, etc with one or more words obscured by questions marks and a notation of a non-English language.  Players will need to guess the word(s) obscured by the question marks.&#10;&#10;2) Movie Titles in English with a notation of a country where that movie was translated into a non-direct translation. Players will need to provide their best guess of the translated movie title in that country. (For example, you might guess that Star Wars in China might be translated into &quot;Space Adventures&quot;.)&#10;&#10;3) Idioms in a non-English language with a direct translation into English and a notation about the language the idiom comes from originally.  Players will need to guess what the idiom is actually about.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 10 rounds. Each round, one player will act as the editor and select 1 random card, and then read the language / country and show the picture, read the movie title, or the translated idiom.&#10;&#10;The editor writes down the actual answer and collects everyone's answer sheets and reviews them. If anyone gets the answer correct, they score points and the answer is not used. The editor then reads the remaining answers in random order.&#10;&#10;Players vote on which answer they believe to be correct. Points are given for those who guess the correct answer and for those who got others to vote for their answer. The editor also grants a bonus point for their favorite answer - often a humorous answer.&#10;&#10;The editor rotates to a new player each round and after 10 rounds, the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Castles of Burgundy is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.&#10;    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.&#10;    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.&#10;    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers and for undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The 2019 edition of The Castles of Burgundy includes eight expansions, seven of which were previously released as promotional items and one new to this release (Shields).&#10;This edition has one fewer double-sided Monastery boards than what came in The Castles of Burgundy: 4th Expansion &#226;&#128;&#147; Monastery Boards. It doesn't include The Castles of Burgundy: 1st Expansion &#226;&#128;&#147; New Player Boards, The Castles of Burgundy: 3rd Expansion &#226;&#128;&#147; German Board Game Championship Board 2013, or The Castles of Burgundy: 7th Expansion &#226;&#128;&#147; German Board Game Championship Board 2016. However it includes one new player board (x4) that had never been released before (Board 2).&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, the player picks one row or column and rolls seven dice to determine what actions can be taken in that furrow. Some of those dice allow the soil to be tilled, seeds to be planted, and mature mushrooms to be harvested, while others allow dice to be rerolled or even indicate the growth of weeds. The better the crop, the better the ale will be!&#10;&#10;But that's where the second part of the game begins: brewing. Even as farming continues, the mushrooms brew and age in casks adjacent to the farm. Many factors affect ale quality, from the original surroundings of the harvested mushroom, to master brewers (gained through dice rolls) improving the process, to the effects gained by eating other mushrooms (or drinking other casks of ale!).&#10;&#10;The harvest season is short and different types of mushrooms grow at different times. Once the time track fills up completely, the game is over, so a dwarven farmer needs to be both a seasoned farmer and an expert alemaker to ensure that they will go down in the annals of Mushroom Ale!&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the August 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

Perhaps you're one of the heroes who has evaded the gauntlet of traps in Dragonvault; perhaps you're a pirate marauder surveying your booty in Goblins, Guns &amp; Grog; perhaps you're just a generic treasure hunter in a generic fantasy RPG. Either way, a dozen chests are now staring you in the face, tantalizing you with promise of hidden treasure, and mocking you with their intricate locking systems. Good thing you brought your lockpicks!&#10;&#10;Lockpicks is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write game that takes place in the Legends of Dsyx fantasy setting. The game picks up where most others end, with the hero surveying their acquired treasure. Now, the challenge is to open as many as possible of twelve chests and find the best prizes inside. Chests consist of small grids with start points, end points, and a number of waypoints, each of which must be activated in order to unlock the treasure. Each turn, the player picks one chest and rolls five dice. Each number corresponds to one type of movement based on units in chess. Beginning at the start point, the player must utilize the dice in any order to navigate the grid, activate each waypoint, and end at the finishing point. Upon successful completion of a puzzle, the player may roll a die to select one of several treasures, each of which may give just give points or even assist in the unlocking of more loot.&#10;&#10;Time is running out, however, and if the player doesn't unlock all the chests before the time track fills up entirely, each additional turn runs the risk of alerting the guards/dragon/merchant/anyone and causing the player to lose ALL their prized possessions.&#10;&#10;Good job beating whatever game you were playing; now, play Lockpicks to find out what happens after the credits have rolled. Will you be rich as a king, or as poor as you started?&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the November 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

Attractions alongside this path will flourish, while those that receive no foot traffic will need to close.&#10;&#10;Only those sights that remain open at the end of the fair will score points, and only by scoring high will the fairies even consider hiring you for the job again next year.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the September 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

Each one of the species in the game, represented by Biodiversity Cards, will play a role in the ecosystem, forming trophic hierarchies (food chains).&#10;The players will get to experience different ecosystems in a fun way while never fully controlling nature itself, given that each organism acts in unexpected and surprising ways.&#10;&#10;&ndash; Description provided by the publisher.&#10;&#10;In Toskasi players are racing to be the first to get to 50 points on the point track. They&rsquo;ll win points by acquiring and combining different cards depicting organisms (Biodiversity Cards), either through building food chains according to their relationships within the different ecosystems or by possessing majorities on the different kinds of cards acquired.&#10;&#10;The player board is divided into four quadrants, each one depicting an ecosystem. These quadrants are traversed by tracks with different symbols on them.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player will roll a die and move their Explorer into the track across one of the four ecosystems, advancing as many spaces as indicated by the roll. If later on any other player lands on the same space, they will share it.&#10;&#10;Upon landing on a space, the player will immediately take a card depending on the symbol depicted on that space: Biodiversity Cards, depicting an organism and an ability; &lsquo;Unknowns&rsquo; event cards, which might affect other player&rsquo;s cards and are resolved immediately; and &lsquo;Wisdom of Nature&rsquo; special power cards. The event cards will also toggle the Day-Night Cycle, which will affect the abilities on the Biodiversity Cards.&#10;&#10;All Biodiversity Cards acquired are laid face up on the table, building rows. As soon as a row has been built up as a complete food chain, it must be scored. All the cards which were used to build it are then discarded into a discard pile.&#10;&#10;After all actions for that player have been resolved, gameplay goes around the table in clockwise order and the first player to get to 50 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

One player rolls the two dice &ndash; one showing colors, the other symbols &ndash; then everyone simultaneously tries to grab any discs showing the colored symbol determined by the die roll. If a die shows a white face instead of a color or symbol, then that characteristic is ignored for the round. For example, if the roll is white (i.e., blank) and red, then players can grab any disc with a red symbol. If both dice show white, then it's a free-for-all, with players grabbing as many discs as possible!&#10;&#10;A player can use only one hand to grab discs. If a player accidentally grabs the wrong disc, she must return that disc to the playing area, along with an additional disc as a penalty. When all the discs have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most discs wins!&#10;&#10;",

Two hundred and fifty?&#10;&#10;As she thought about her punishment, her tension rose, making her grind her teeth against her gag. If only she could wear through the Demon hide strap stuffed in her mouth as easily as her feet wore down the floor. The muzzle muted her powers, without it she could easily break out of here.&#10;&#10;Those were the terms of her imprisonment. She was stuck here, listening to the others moan and whine, until she could break free. Thinking about the havoc she would cause when she got out. What a pleasure it would be to feel the energy of Neemoss leaping from her fingers once again.&#10;&#10;With a slow breath, she calmed her mind. Focus on the power, not on the words. If she could only reach the energy around her without speaking the phrases her demon-god taught her. She stared at her chain&rsquo;s anchors on the walls one more time, another breath and she closed her eyes. The anchors shattered. She stared, wide-eyed for a moment, then she concentrated on each of her fellow captives one by one, their bodies turning to dust and ash.&#10;&#10;Her sentence was over! Girtiya allowed herself a moment of triumph as she stared at the heavy wooden door, knowing it was no match for her new magic. But before she could splinter the barrier, it dissolved as a swirling mist swept into the room, sucking her into the Conjunction. It seemed like Girtiya would not be roaming free in Neemoss after all.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players will roll dice to move on the grid based board and use weapon and attack cards to overpower and defeat the enemies, and Devil Gundam, to save the LaCroix Kingdom!&#10;&#10;SD Gundam: LaCroix Heroes has two game modes:&#10;&#10;Game Mode One: The Three Legendary Sacred Shrines. In this game mode, players will be battling the forces of Devil Gundam who have seized control of the Legendary Sacred Shrines. In order to defeat Satan Gundam, you must journey to the Shrines, defeat the enemies within, collect the Sacred Treasure from each shrine (Shield of Power, Armor of Power, and the Sword of Fire) in order to be powerful enough to defeat Devil Gundam.&#10;&#10;Game Mode Two: Castle of Devil Gundam. The Knight Gundams, having reached the fortress of the enemy, with the Three Sacred Treasures in hand, must penetrate and search the Castle to find the Sacred Stone Tablet with the spell that will imbue the Sacred Treasures with their legendary power, allowing the players to try and defeat Devil Gundam. But will victory prove so easy?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The purpose of the game is to have fun with friends, ideally in a party setting. The game is a card version of the spin-the-bottle game that has been played at teen-ager parties for decades. It worked like this: a mix of girls and boys sat in circle on the floor. In turn, somebody spun an empty bottle in the middle of the circle. When the bottle stopped, the &quot;spinner&quot; kissed or slapped the cheek of the boy or girl the bottle pointed to. It never failed to get some young hormones flowing and some cheeks reddening (and not just because they had been slapped). It was an innocent enough game for innocent times.&#10;&#10;Inhibited attempts to recreate that feeling with cards and extends the slapping/kissing to several actions. It also specifies a series of body parts, but without ever crossing the limit of decency and good taste.&#10;&#10;A player sets up an activity between two players (e.g., Peter is to bring his nose in contact with with Paul's ear) and all players in turn can play cards to change the activity and/or the players involved; when there are no more changes, the activity that resulted from all the changes must be carried out. For example, Jane might have to rub her cheek against Peter's neck.&#10;&#10;All players involved in an action receive points. If a player refuses to perform an action, s/he is penalised with negative points. The game ends when all 108 cards have been played or when the turn goes around the table without anybody setting up a new action. The winner is the player who has accumulated the highest number of points.&#10;&#10;Players can play as individuals or in teams.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Unused production points are discarded. The player also has the option to trade production points of one type for another but at a 4:1 ratio to indicate the impact of repurposing machines.&#10;&#10;The vehicle cards are pulled through the system and production points are allocated as they progress through the system.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the last hour on Friday, or the 5th round.

They need the support of an entity, one willing to take the necessary risks even to break the law. That said, we should clarify they agreed to only proceed against criminals, so the school will accept orders just for assassins, thieves and terrorists who escaped justice.&#10;&#10;Students will have to take these orders, with the name of criminals written on them. Once they got the name, the next step is to register it on the Black List. The ones marked on the list, will be doomed. There are professors to help them in their path. Meanwhile, in the shadows, there&rsquo;s a new clan rising, the Elite, with which trainees may interact as well.&#10;&#10;Each student has their own motivation, so watch out and keep your role secret. Everyone has their specific objectives to win the game. And if your identity is revealed or you cannot fulfill them, your victory objectives will change.&#10;&#10;In this hidden role game for 2-6 players, you must complete your objectives before you get killed, and be faster than the others.&#10;&#10;You'll need to contact with the elite and several professors,to get help; to get black parchments to complete the orders; to destroy your enemies, in other words, to kill your friends' characters so you have the only one alive; to steal your student files; to go through the elite path and do the blood covenant...&#10;&#10;But most important of all, you must recover information. Info is the new coin. But be careful who you trust, no one is what they seem to be in this school...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A cold, thick fog hangs in the air, and the gnarled branches gently sway and clack in the fetid breeze. The forest floor is covered in a spongy moss, and the soft black soil beneath hides the countless bones and treasures of untold eons. It is difficult not to feel utterly alone in the stillness of the woods, but the creatures of the forest know you are here. They are hungry for the fleeting warmth that only life carries, and they desire above all else revenge upon the living!&#10;&#10;This Deluxe OtherWorld Expansion allows your Heroes to explore the haunted Forest of the Dead, battling Undead versions of virtually any Enemies you have in your collection, as well as a host of new and terrifying creatures that roam the shadowy woods!&#10;&#10;Like all OtherWorlds, The Forest of the Dead has a set of unique Encounters, Artifacts, Map Cards, and OtherWorld Threat cards, as well as a couple of Global Rules that make adventuring there more distinct. The Global Rules are listed on the World Card included in this expansion. While exploring the Forest of the Dead, Heroes will find themselves picking their way through densely packed decayed trees and crumbling stone ruins, shining their lantern&rsquo;s light through the cold fog that hangs in the air. Many have found their way into the dark Forest, whether through death or gateway, but few ever find their way back out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On their turn a player can answer a new question. Or, they can choose to answer a question held by another player. If people like the answer better they claim the card. Most cards at the end wins.

The major foreign powers have refused to follow and so Austria must go to war alone. The time is propitious because the Great Army is at the other end of Europe, in Spain, facing a combattive people, and Austria hopes that the German peoples will rise up against France as well. On March 30, its armies, led by the Archduke Charles, invade Bavaria with no declaration of war in hopes of surprising the French army dispersed in Germany before their reinforcements can arrive. Will it be able to hold out until the arrival of the Emperor or will the Archduke push it back north of the Danube in disorder?&#10;&#10;&#10;Les Aigles du Danube&#10;&#10;Mars 1809, depuis des mois l&rsquo;Autriche s&rsquo;arme pour prendre sa revanche d&rsquo;Austerlitz.

Your goal is to find the Exit, hidden among the various rooms of this labyrinth, and the two Keys you need to open it. Keys can be found by exploring the Halls, but if all else fails, there&rsquo;s always the option to take one out of&hellip; other participants! Each of you has a Key sewn into your body while you were sleeping, the macabre detail courtesy of the Master of the Ceremony, who watches your struggles using his cameras, and mixes up the playing field from afar&hellip; Only one of you can escape, the others will stay in the Halls &ndash; forever!&#10;&#10;All Players declare their actions for the turn in secret, and then reveal them simultaneously. Players explore, search rooms to find weapons and other items that will increase their chances of survival, and fight one another for the ultimate prize - their life! Other participants are not their only concern, however, as the host of this bloody spectacle also directs a twisted Killer, more monster than man, who moves around the board in search of victims. At the end of each turn, the First Player momentarily takes on the role of the Master of the Ceremony, and, in addition to executing other effects that influence the game&rsquo;s board, needs to direct the Killer. Will you avoid him, or try to face him for the chance to grasp one of the Keys you need from his cold, dead hands? Just be warned, as the Killer might still take revenge from beyond the grave!&#10;&#10;And if you perish? Well, you won&rsquo;t get to escape, but you can still play AS the Master of the Ceremony and make sure nobody else escapes, either. Choose cards from a wider selection and customize your approach. Will you close off rooms to make the board more cramped, forcing players to fight, or will you incentivize players with strategically placed Gifts? Who will the Killer target now that you have sole control of him? The weakest or the strongest participants?&#10;&#10;Explore, search, fight or flee, find the Exit, gain the Keys and escape&hellip; or remain in the Halls of Horror forever! 2-4 players can go head-to-head in their bid for survival, and you can also face the challenge alone in the game&rsquo;s solo mode!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Living in darkness, Bone Eaters have no eyes. Instead they use their keen sense of vibrations and smell, absorbing scents through their outstretched fingers, as they search feverishly for anything worth devouring. Even the slightest noise or movement can alert them to your presence, drawing them away from whatever old refuse they were feeding on, with the prospect of a fresher meal!&#10;&#10;Bone Eaters are creatures native to the Belly of the Beast, though they are also known to wander the Forest of the Dead, as it is a world rich with things for them to feed upon! Attracted to movement and sound, Bone Eaters pounce on Heroes that move too quickly or make a lot of noise by attacking. If you stay still and silent, you just may be able to avoid the worst of their attacks, as they simply run their groping fingers across your face, sniffing for tasty morsels to devour. With their oversized mouths and gnashing jaws, Bone Eaters can steal away your items or Tokens, crushing and swallowing them if you don&rsquo;t retrieve them in time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Is this a fresh start for the dystopian citizens, or will history repeat itself?&#10;&#10;Ignorance Is Bliss is a &quot;more stuff&quot; expansion. Or perhaps a better way of putting it is &quot;alternative stuff.&quot; For example, there are a bunch of new recruit cards and market tiles that you can use as an alternative to the recruits and markets in the original game (they aren't designed to be mixed together with the original recruits and markets). There's also a new type of recruit card (not a new faction, just a new type).&#10;&#10;Ignorance Is Bliss is also a &quot;player count&quot; expansion. The original game of Euphoria was for 2-6 players, but the expansion adds an Automa mode (an intelligent AI system) that expands the game to 1-6 players. The Automa system is also designed for optional use in 2-player games so they feel more like 4-player games.&#10;&#10;Ignorance Is Bliss is also an &quot;improve the rules&quot; expansion. Euphoria itself still stands on its own, but given that it was released 5 years ago, we've listened to a lot of feedback about certain frustrations and perceived imbalances, and we've addressed them with some new rules, a &quot;New Antiques Bazaar&quot; board, and some new components.&#10;&#10;Euphoria: Ignorance Is Bliss is an expansion to Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Night was falling and it was time to feed. She lay back in her bed, closed her eyes, and slipped into a deep trance-like state that was as close as she got to sleeping.&#10;&#10;Her mind drifted across the dreamscape, looking for a psyche to invade. Her mind probed minions, taunting a Condemned with thoughts of freedom, a Ravenous with visions of a barren land with no food and a Twisted with a hale and beautiful body. But there was no sport and little sustenance in such weak beings. She needed something with more power to drain.&#10;&#10;Suddenly, the Astral Plane warped and reformed around her, as another entity left the waking world and began to exert its own will on the malleable landscape. It could only be another Witch, certainly a meal worth taking. Mara watched carefully as the being revealed its likes and fears in its growing manifestation. No, this was not a Witch, it was a Demon. Still, perhaps the risk was worth taking. If Mara could drain a small fraction of its essence while it was distracted by her visions, her power would grow immeasurably.&#10;&#10;As she conjured images of weakness in the Demon&rsquo;s slumber, she realized she had overstepped: she was losing control of the dream! Was the Demon simply waking? Or was it taking control? She had moments to decide if she should flee or gamble all for her prize. Then the truth became clear. She was waking! This was her esoteric domain. Never before had she been dragged from it.&#10;&#10;She tensed for an attack as she struggled to focus on the physical world. But all she could see were swirling mists as she was drawn into the Conjunction.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pocket General is a strategy game that has a chess like approach to combat units, the strategic depth of conquering the globe and a war game's exciting chances to turn things around with a lucky  roll of the dice. And all of it fits in my coat pocket!&#10;&#10;This is a 2 player war game that can be played in about 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;Set Up&#10;Place the center board between the two players. Note that it is divided into three key areas; the Location world map, the 3 hex battlefield and the recruitment areas.&#10;&#10;Decide which country each player will use; Germany or Japan versus Russia or the United States. Place your 11 units on your player card. The card includes details on combat unit values in each Location type and a place to manage your recruited units.&#10;&#10;Next, place the Early and Late war markers on the board. These color coded markers show your path to victory.  Place your Capital on its space.&#10;&#10;Randomly place all the Location hexes on the world map. Now you can see the global map and plan the entire war.&#10;&#10;Each player gets one Operations die. See how they have positive and negative numbers? These unique dice have unevenly distributed values, to keep great plans unreliable and ensure the fates of war are always at risk.&#10;&#10;Now you are ready to play.&#10;After both players recruit units, Players take turns placing them on the battlefield. There is a lot of depth in this chess like exchange  &mdash;&nbsp;each unit performs differently in each Location &mdash; and you watch your enemy commit troops &mdash; so battle is a back and forth struggle to outwit your enemy to get the best dice odds.&#10;&#10;Sum the combat values of your units, then roll to resolve combat. Place the Locations you conquer on your war markers to conquer the world.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win. The first is to force capitulation by filling your war markers with conquered locations before your opponent does.  The second is to unlock your enemy&rsquo;s capitol in the late war and take it in combat.

    "Description": "&quot;Show your swiftness and skills stacking all the pieces before everything collapses!&quot;&#10;&#10;In this game, the electronic talking platform determines which tetris piece the player must place onto it. He must stack the piece in time and push the stop button or the platform will start rumbling and knocking down the pieces. The game dinamics will change depending on which stacking rules the players chooses at the beginning: Straight tower or not, gaps or no gaps and allowing pieces protruding outside the platform or not. The game ends when all the pieces are stacked or when the tower collapses.&#10;&#10;A second, non electronic, edition is also available.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
