Actions are performed on a points basis, so a character could run forward and fire a few badly-aimed shots, or stand still and fire more rounds at a target.&#10;&#10;The game contains a large amount of detail concerning combat and psychological effects.&#10;&#10;Rules for purchasing and trading equipment for players' gangs, were also included.&#10;&#10;The game appears to be the precursor of Necromunda, published five years later.&#10;&#10;",

Generally at each space the player earns the indicated amount of money, but before collecting, must spin the arrow which often excludes a coin denomination from the payout.

Game ends when a player reaches the Finish space and winner is player with the most money.&#10;&#10;Educational game aimed at developing children's knowledge of coin money and their ability to perform basic addition.&#10;&#10;Canadian version has $1 'Loonie' coins in place of $1 bills.&#10;&#10;",

Finally no more orgies of throwing dice.&#10;&#10;Gruftmeister Adventure is a totally new game, you don't need an older version of Gruftmeister.

    "Description": "SuDoku: Die Spielesammlung is a set of six games which use similar Sudoku-like rules to govern placement of tiles.&#10;&#10;In each game, players have identical sets of tiles (numbered 1-9 multiple times) and each turn play one which is randomly drawn. Certain defined sections of the board can only have one of each number in them. When each of certain small sections of the board is filled, the tiles for each player in the section are totaled and points given for first and second place. Bonus points are also given for players who complete larger board sections. The sections which define the placement constraints, regular scoring, and bonus scoring vary from game to game.&#10;&#10;The six games are:&#10;&#10;1. Classic-SuDoku, played on the standard 9x9 grid.&#10;&#10;2. Labyrinth-SuDoku, played on a board divided into nine irregular nine-square sections.&#10;&#10;3. Killer-SuDoku, played on a board divided into many small sections.&#10;&#10;4. Kakuro, played on a 9x9 grid interrupted by numbered squares. This game can be played two ways - in one version the numbered squares provide an additional constraint and way to earn bonus points.&#10;&#10;5. 3D-SuDoku, played on a board which depicts three faces of a cube, giving eight-space rows in three directions.&#10;&#10;6. Hexa-SuDoku, played on a board divided into nine regions of nine hexagons each.&#10;&#10;",

The IAGO Chess system accomplishes its objectives by the use of multiple versions (classes) of the game that represent the fullness of the chess experience. These versions build upon one another,&#10;to allow a person to get fully familiar with the game. There are six versions (classes) of the game. These versions are: A-Class, B-Class, C-Class, M-Class, V-Class, and X-Class.&#10;&#10;This version of chess is more than just a chess variant, it is a system by which chess can integrate variants and evolve.  It has multiple layers and is robust enough to change over time.  Its mission is to be a forever evolving version of chess that will provide a migration path for changes.&#10;&#10;It is also meant as a framework for playing all versions of chess relating to the International Abstract Games Organization.&#10;&#10;For the actual rules, check out the Chess Variants website:&#10;http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSiagochesssyste&#10;&#10;",

There is a distinct advantage to fantasy role gaming from a board; and that is it gets rid of the need for a Game Master or scenario creator. The board, cards and matrix tables contain all the information necessary and the dice determine the outcome of your adventure. No human arbitrator is necessary.&#10;&#10;All the passages, rooms, treasure and monsters are randomly generated. This makes no two adventures ever the same. Each time you enter the Witchlord's Castle you can expect a completely different scenario stocked with new treasure and monsters. As the player moves around the board, he will receive information about the configurations of the Witchlord's Castle. This will enable the player to plot his progress on the graph paper given.&#10;&#10;The player will choose one of the six Adventure Classes to play. this determines the player's spell and weapon capability.&#10;&#10;The player's objective in the game is to collect proficiency points. This is done by the slaying of monsters and the collection of treasure. Encounters and treasure are dictated by the playing cards and matrix tables. When the player reaches the 10th stratum or proficiency level, he must do battle with one of the Witchlord's generals. If the General is vanquished, the the player has won and earned safe passage out of Witchlord's Castle.&#10;&#10;The Witchlord Game can be played as a single scenario, or as a campaign game.&#10;&#10;",

From the middle of the board a pawn is moved according to the number of squares mentioned on the start counter.  An even number makes the pawn land on on counter, an uneven number lets the pawn get next to a counter. The start counter can be removed from the board and is the first gain of the first player. When the pawn lands on a counter, it is turned upside down, then the pawn is placed upon it, so the number becomes invisible. The player must name the right number in his next turn. When he is right the player may take the counter as a win, when wrong he loses a turn. When there are no more counters that can be gained in one turn, the game ends and the player having acquired the highest total when adding the number of the counters won, is the winner of Zipher.&#10;NB the game is a 3 player game.&#10;&#10;",
