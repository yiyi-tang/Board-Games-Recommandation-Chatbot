    "Description": "Tito (and his Partisan Army - Yugoslavia, 1941-45) is an abstract simulation of guerilla warfare in the Balkans during the Second World War. The game portrays all of the elements of this dynamic partisan campaign, which successfully tied down large numbers of Axis troops on occupation duties and eventually helped liberate Yugoslavia and Albania from Axis domination.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #81, the game included a 22&quot;X34&quot; map, 12 page rulebook, and 200 counters.&#10;&#10;The maps areas are divided into numerous display boxes (each with their own victory point value) which represent mountains, hideaways, and city objectives. The Yugoslav player gains points for occupying these areas. If the Yugoslav player accumulates more than 600 points over the course of the game (17 turns), he wins... otherwise, the German player does.&#10;&#10;Errata: see this thread.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ares Magazine #9. Delta Vee is a tactical simulation of combat among spaceships in the 24th Century. The game is intended for two players, although more may participate in scenarios devised by the players. Each hex on the Delta Vee game maps represents a volume 20,000 kilometers in diameter. The game uses a two-dimensional movement system; the &ldquo;plane&rdquo; of the playing area represents the ecliptic of the star system in which each battle occurs. Each Game-Turn represents 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;During play, each player moves one or more spaceships about the game-map using a maneuver system that abstractly simulates the laws of Newtonian motion. Each spaceship is composed of a hull with a varying number of attached pods. Each pod represents a system that improves the ship&rsquo;s capabilities in combat, movement, and/or some other aspect of spaceship operations.&#10;&#10;Each player controls his spaceships by issuing Maneuver Commands (so that the ship may alter its velocity or direction of movement) and Battle Commands (so that weapons and other systems aboard the ship may be prepared for use). A spaceship&rsquo;s combat abilities include laser fire, particle fire, four types of missiles, and battle craft (two man fighter craft launched from larger ships). The attributes of each spaceship are recorded on a Spaceship Log before beginning play. During the game, energy expended, missiles launched, and damage incurred by the ship are recorded on the ship&rsquo;s log.&#10;&#10;Delta Vee is the tactical space combat system for SPI&rsquo;s science fiction role-playing game, Universe. Although there is little open warfare in the vast human interstellar empire of the 24th Century (contact with another space-faring race has yet to be established), there are many types of illegal ship traffic and disputes among self-governing worlds. These types of small conflicts form the background for the scenarios in Delta Vee.&#10;&#10;",

Her carnival costume (wooden pieces) are hidden in a large cloth bag. They fit on the game board in pre-determined ways. Each turn, the players simultaneously reach into the bag to find the next matching puzzle piece. The winner is the player who places the most pieces.&#10;&#10;Ramba Samba demands tactile awareness in a fun-filled way. Because only the player who can feel the matching pieces fastest will win.&#10;&#10;",

In Fake Art Inc., you are expert brokers who must collect fake masterpieces and distribute them in the market. After all, you need to make a profit. Increase the emotional value of all the art in your collection, and disrupt the market by dropping the appraisal value of other player's art. With the right timing, even an artwork of no value can be sold at a high price to another broker. See how easy it is to make money by selling art?&#10;&#10;In more detail, players first decide the turn order by bidding. On their turn, players can either trade their hand with others or place it on a space between players to set up an auction. Cards are placed face down, and equivalent cards are placed down together. You can make money by selling your hand cards, and the price is determined by the number and location of &quot;genuine&quot; and &quot;fake&quot; cards that have been placed down. Players can change the selling price by replacing existing cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

During the journey players must play the right cards from their limited hand to avoid obstacles placed before them by their opponents.  Of course, having possession of the singular Blue Amulet allows a player to ignore many of these obstacles without needing the appropriate card.  Players can also maneuver their pawns (through the use of movement cards) in such a way as to bump their opponents onto a path going in the wrong direction.&#10;&#10;The board is beautifully illustrated and the game won the Spiel des Jahres award for Most Beautiful Game in 1986.&#10;&#10;Das Blaue Amulett is the second game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Der Feuersalamander being the first and third.&#10;&#10;",

Players will collect cards and treasure, move guards, and hide within the city of Constantinople until they find their time to strike. Combat is handled through cardplay, and the player who best manages his cards will have the best chance at victory.&#10;&#10;At the start of each player's turn, he draws an Event card, which can spawn new targets in the outer city, move guards, or allow you to find a tunnel to another section of the city. Moving guards is a great way to get them away from you and place them near your opponents. Targets cannot be assassinated while a guard is nearby, but fortunately the guards can be dispatched if need be.&#10;&#10;Cards in hand drive the action, but they are also your hit points. If you run out of cards in hand, you die &mdash; but just like in a video game, you will soon respawn at your starting area. Moving and attacking targets (or your fellow players) requires playing cards, so doing too much all at once can be risky. Couple that with trying to avoid the guards and you are in for a tension-filled game of cat-and-mouse. To replenish your hand, complete objectives on your movement cards or hide. Hiding in the outer city is easy and grants you lots of extra cards. When you enter the merchant district or the area around the palace, there just aren&rsquo;t as many places to hide and you will not draw many cards.&#10;&#10;Combat is handled through cardplay. No dice are required, although a six-sided die is included to resolve some guard movement. Do you save your best cards for movement or to go in for the kill? He who risks the most has the chance for the most reward!&#10;&#10;",

The first down marker is placed 10 yards forward. On his turn, the offensive player gets three moves with which he can move one man three spaces, one man two spaces and another one space or three men one space each. The defensive player makes his three moves after the offensive player. Once the defensive player has made his three moves, the offensive player moves once again. Play continues until the ball carrier is tackled, a team scores or an incomplete pass is thrown. In order to tackle the ball carrier, the defensive player must land one of his men on the square occupied by the ball carrier. Dice rolls are used to resolve passing.&#10;&#10;The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Description from rulebook&#10;The N.F.L.

They take turns playing cards for themselves and their partners with trump shifting when they cannot follow suit. Cards are worth their face value (0 to 10), but tricks cost 20 points! Thus they want to take the valuable tricks and make their opponent take the costly tricks.&#10;&#10;Buddy on your Left: a game for 3 players where each player's score is his own plus that of his left hand neighbor!&#10;A card is led then players in turn play cards either higher or lower than the lead card. As long as the played cards are lower, the pile continues to grow. As soon as a card higher in value than the initial card is played, that player sweeps the entire pile. Cards from 1 to 6 score their value, 7 to 10 are worth nothing. After the last card is played, you score for the cards you collected plus the cards your left hand opponent collected. Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The Third Man: an outrageous bidding game for 4 players&#10;The game consists of a series of auctions, for each of which the house puts up a prize fund of 10 points. Highest bidder gets the 10 points, less the number he had bid (ex. if he bid 9, he earns 1). The second highest bidder loses the full amount he had bid (ex. if he bid 7 he loses 7). Whereas the third highest bidder receives from the house double the number he had bid (if he bid 5, he pockets 10!). Therefore in each auction your objective is to be third--and in any case not second&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The theme of this card game is the Battle of Aljubarrota, fought in 1385 between Portugal and Spain.&#10;&#10;There are two king cards and 42 cards organised in 7 'suits' (crowns, shields, banners, archers, people, cavalry, infantry) each with 6 values and colours. Each player takes a king card and half the shuffled deck face down. Each player draws a card from their their pile and places it face up. From then on each player draws a card from their pile and places it in one of the face up piles, if it matches the suit, colour or value. If not, either it returns to the bottom of the pile, or it is placed together with a king card on any pile. The aim is to be the first to get rid of their cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the late summer of 1777, the British master plan to sever New England from the rest of the rebellious American colonies had come unhinged, leaving John Burgoyne's Northern Army dangerously isolated. In an attempt to break through American defenses to reach Albany, New York, Burgoyne launched his army at the American defenses on Bemis Heights. An American screen dispatched by Benedict Arnold clashed with the British advance in deep woods, triggering an afternoon-long fight fed by reinforcements for both sides. The battle ended in stalemate, as good as a defeat for Burgoyne, but might have tipped in his favor.&#10;&#10;Saratoga uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Special rules cover the characteristics of eighteenth century warfare, especially the emergence of light infantry, and the differences between regulars and militia. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;&#10;     Level: Battalion/Brigade&#10;     Hex: 352 yards&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Time is precious and it is vital to plan your actions wisely!&#10;&#10;Dwar7s Duel is a fast-paced, worker placement and resource management game for two players. It plays in 30 minutes, making it perfect for a quick match on the road or on game night! Dwar7s Duel is a 2 player version of Dwar7s Fall and compatible with Dwar7s Fall expansions.&#10;&#10;In this game, players take turns performing up to 3 actions, then resolving cards in the tableau, and finally discarding down to 9 cards. An action can be playing a kingdom card from their hand to a shared tableau, moving a dwarf, or upgrading a worker.&#10;&#10;Resolving cards is is done by removing dwarves from the card (if the dwarves on the card are all the same color), and collecting the rewards. Using these rewards allows the player to complete private and public goals.&#10;&#10;Be careful, because discarding down to the hand limit of 9 cards can include having to discard recently acquired gems and ogres, as players cannot discard kingdom cards.&#10;&#10;These player turns will continue until one player has completed at least three goals. At this time, the other player will get one last turn, if they haven't already had a turn this round.&#10;&#10;Finally, victory points are tallied from completed goals, defeated monsters, gems in hand, and kingdoms.&#10;&#10;",

The game board features six tracks, 6-10 spaces long worth 2-4 points, with a food space at the end of each track.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls six dice, then can reroll a number of dice equal to his total of active ants on the board.

Longer straights equal more attacks, and two attacks are needed to dislodge an ant in the valuable food spaces.&#10;&#10;After attacking, the player chooses all dice of one value and moves an ant forward on the track of that number equal to the number of dice chosen. Land on another ant, and it's trapped beneath you. Land on the food space, and you have earned the points shown there &ndash; points you can lose if someone attacks you later.&#10;&#10;If you don't like what you rolled (and rerolled), you can skip the attack and movement phase to take a Queen token. On a later turn, you can hand in a Queen to make an extra attack, gain an additional reroll, or move two ants on different tracks. A player can hold only one Queen token.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player holds 6-9 food points, with the total depending on the number of players, that player instantly wins.&#10;&#10;",

One player starts in the corner and moves the tube. If it goes over an empty space, the disc falls and occupies the place. The other player can choose to then take this tube, or start with the other, so removing the starting advantage. The players then continue to move their tubes around, until one gets 11 discs down for the win. The tubes can be moved orthogonally or diagonally any distance, but not jump or turn corners.&#10;&#10;Reportedly a good abstract game and a clever physical mechanism.&#10;&#10;",

But instead of quietly writing down many words for many categories at the same time, players work in teams to yell out words while the timer ticks down.  The categories change while the letter stays the same.&#10;&#10;Everything you need is in the electronic game unit.  The categories and letters come up at random.&#10;&#10;There is also a game setting that changes the letter and keeps the category the same.  And a setting where both change after every answer.&#10;&#10;",

(The goal card is played during the game as an animal card.) Each kind of animal has a power when played: the meerkat allows the player to draw an additional card; the lion returns a card next to him face down; the elephant returns a card next to him face up; and the rhino moves a card. Some animal cards depict ponds, and animals next to ponds score two points instead of one.&#10;&#10;",

First we check for ties. The tie numbers are gone and then the highest card wins. Cards are 1 to 6. Four times per card.&#10;&#10;If after the first check we have a 1 card and a 6, then the 1 card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;So now all keep the winning trick cards and we are ready for phase 2.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 is Russian roulette, a game of chance. We have 6 cards (bullet cards) in the middle of the table, as a revolver. 5 &quot;Clic&quot; cards and one with a bullet...&#10;&#10;On your turn (beginning with the player with the most cards from phase one):&#10;You can draw a card (pull the trigger) or you can discard one card from that you collect before, to shuffle all open bullet cards back together and then draw one, you just spin the cylinder of the revolver, (no point to do it if you have to draw the first bullet)&#10;or you can discard as many cards as alive players in the game to pass your turn to the next player. Finally, you can also choose to reveal two consecutive open bullet cards: If you survive, you'll be able to steal cards from other players!&#10;&#10;When you draw we check if you die or live from the bullet card.&#10;If you stay alive the game continues to the next player. If you die we shuffle the bullet cards and continue with the player with most cards.&#10;&#10;Last man standing is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To achieve this, players have 330 cards between units, supports and locations in order to build their own forces deck to use in battle against opponents, in the locations determined by each player. EverZone introduces a revolutionary game mechanism to minimize random elements, creating extremely tactical challenges.&#10;&#10;EverZone ist ein strategisches Kartenspiel, das in einer fernen Zukunft spielt. Jeder Spieler kontrolliert Truppen, um seine Spezies zu verteidigen und seine Kontrolle im Universum auszuweiten.

Um das zu erreichen, baut jeder Spieler aus 330 Karten mit &quot;Units&quot;, &quot;Supports&quot; und &quot;Locations&quot; sein eigenes Deck, das er dann im Kampf gegen seine Gegner an den Schaupl&auml;tzen einsetzt, die von den Spielern bestimmt werden. Das Novum an EverZone sind Mechanismen, die die Spielstrategie auf h&ouml;chste Level anheben und den Zufallsfaktor auf ein Minimum reduzieren.&#10;&#10;",

Each card is one of five colors with a matching colored totem in the center of the card, and the border of the card has sixteen symbols in a mixture of the five colors.&#10;&#10;To start a round, each player takes a card from the center, looks at the border to see which color/symbol is most prominent, then takes a card of this color, looks at the border, etc. until the player has placed a total of five cards in front of them. One all players have finished, the first player to finish uses a magic eye card to verify that they made the correct color choices for each card that they placed. If they did, they take the highest scoring card for the round; if not, they get nothing.&#10;&#10;After a certain number of rounds, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

And where is the witch?!&#10;&#10;In Gruselrunde zur Geisterstunde, players first construct the villa, placing the walls in the box, then sliding cardboard characters on their cardboard &quot;wands&quot; through some of the ten slots. This villa then has a light placed inside it before a roof is added. Each round, a player is challenged to place two characters into the center of the villa. This player moves two of the wands so that the characters inside the villa are pushed forward; she then peeks through a peephole to see whether she's correct, and if so, she gains a scoring token after other players get to verify the characters. After a player collects her third token, finish the round so that everyone has the same number of turns. Whoever has three tokens wins!&#10;&#10;Gruselrunde zur Geisterstunde includes a variant in which each round the active player is challenged to place three characters in the center of the villa (instead of two), and opponents guess whether or not this player was correct. After the active player pushes in the character wands, each opponent secretly places either a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; token in hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If the active player was right, she gains two scoring tokens while each opponent who guessed &quot;yes&quot; earns one; if she's wrong, then each opponent who guessed &quot;no&quot; earns one token. The winning threshold in this variant is 8-10 tokens, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;",

This game focus on shorter game length than its predecessor and allows for less players (3 or 4 in this version, compared to 3 to 6 in the original version).&#10;&#10;From the official rules manual (in portuguese):&#10;The Roman empire was one of the greatest and longest empires in history. It started before the birth of Christ (B.C.) and lasted, in the East, until year 476 A.D. (anno domini) and, in the West, until 1453 A.D. Let us go back to year 140 D.C., when this Empire reached its greatest extension and dominated practically all Europe, part of Asia and northern Africa. Times that were not completely peaceful, for enemies threatened the borders of the empire and the conquered people insurrected against domination, seeking freedom. Go back in time with War: Roman Empire and feel the thrill of defending your borders and advancing your legions, conquering provinces of the roman world in 140 A.D.! Observe, though, that the political division of the provinces adopted in the board objectives to ease the game mechanics, and not portrait the reality of that age. All province and sea names are written in latin. Only the region names are in portuguese. Each players is dealt an objective, that will only be known by himself. The knowledge of this objective by other players will make your conquest harder. It is important for the player to, when reading the rules, try some practical plays, simulating, inclusively, the mentioned examples. This way it will be much easier to understand the mechanisms of WAR.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    War&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Little did you know that you weren&rsquo;t the only Senator with such lofty goals, as there are other Senators with a similar agenda.

    "Description": "The BoardGameGeek glossary helpfully includes the term &quot;fart-factor&quot; for those who have wondered how to describe the gassy sound created when pushing down on a box lid. Who knew that someday a couple of game designers would move the farts from inside the box to the front cover?&#10;&#10;Yes, PRRRT... &ndash; from the designing duo of Ludovic Maublanc and Bruno Cathala &ndash; is all about the rip-roarers and pants-busters that emerge from one's nether regions, more specifically about determining who dealt it (while thankfully avoiding the &quot;who smelt it&quot; end of the equation).&#10;&#10;Each round a situation card is revealed, such as a small crowd in an elevator, and a number of people cards equal to the crowd depicted on the card are turned face up. People cards are valued from 1 to 10 based on the amount of shame that person would have towards you should you be revealed as the culprit. Grannies are merciless...&#10;&#10;Each player receives a hand of five odor cards, ranging in value from 0 to 7, with one 7, two 6s and so on to eight 0s. Going once around the table, each player in turn asks his neighbor, &quot;So how about it? Are you the one contributing to climate change? Are you the one making more methane?&quot; And so on. That neighbor can either fess up &ndash; in which case he scores all the people cards in play &ndash; or he can deny the charge, in which case the active player randomly draws a card from his hand and lays it on the table in front of the neighbor, revealing some of the smell that others have detected.&#10;&#10;If you make it once around the table without anyone confessing, add another person card to the crowd of sniffers, then go around the table again. Repeat this process up to three times, at which point most people will have three cards in front of them. Everyone then simultaneously points to the person who they think created the ruckus (that is, who has the largest total of odor cards), abstaining if they are that person. Everyone then sums their stink, with the &quot;winner&quot; claiming the person cards in play and a card for each person blaming him; anyone who accuses a player incorrectly is penalized. Smallest score after a number of rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Being dealt a hand of high numbers doesn't automatically presage your coronation as a gas god as high numbers typically have a special power that comes into play when someone reveals the card from your hand. The 7, for example, removes all other cards in your hand from play, while the 6 lets you exchange up to three cards from your hand with an opponent. With odor comes power!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Banqi, or Half Chess, is a two-player Chinese board game played on a 4x8 grid (usually half of the Chinese Chess board).  Banqi is a social game, usually played for fun rather than serious competition. Because it has a significant element of chance, some people consider it a child's game, but Banqi often has remarkable depth of strategy.&#10;&#10;The 32 pieces are shuffled and randomly allocated face-down to squares on the board.  The first player turns up a piece to begin the game.  The color of the piece he turns up is the color he will play in the game.  The second player then makes a move, and the two alternate until the game is finished.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player cannot move; the player who cannot move loses.  Most often, the game is lost because all of a player&rsquo;s pieces have been captured and so he has no pieces to move.  However, it is possible for one player to surround all of the other player&rsquo;s pieces in a manner that makes it impossible for them to move.&#10;&#10;",

If players wish to proceed to the next level, they must first stop to graduate before moving on. That is, credits obtained at the end of one degree level cannot be carried over as credits towards the next level.
