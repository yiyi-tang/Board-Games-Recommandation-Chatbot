Careful not to make too many mistakes, or your customers won't be pleased...&#10;&#10;The player with the highest points earned from their completed orders, wins!&#10;&#10;Full rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each player is given 5 each of 10 ingredient cards. They can arrange the ingredient cards in front of themselves however they choose. &#10;     The order deck is shuffled and placed face-down in the center of the table. 3. All players take one card from the order deck without looking at the card, and hold the cards above the center of the table face-down. One player takes two cards. The order cards are placed face-up in the center of the table at the same time. &#10;     Everyone races to make one of the burger orders from their ingredient piles. All players go simultaneously. &#10;     When a player finishes an order they grab the order card from the center of the table and place it on top of their gathered ingredients. They place the stack in their section of the table and flip over a new ingredient card from the order deck. &#10;         When building a burger the player should hold the cards for the current burger they are working on in their hands. &#10;         Ingredients must be in the same order they are on the order card with the top burger ingredient on top and the bottom ingredient on the bottom of the stack. &#10;         Players can make an order from any of the cards that are flipped over, they do not have to make an order from the card they flip over. &#10;         If another player completes an order and grabs the order card you were working from, you need to start over with a different order. &#10;         Players can only build one burger at a time, but they can always modify their current, un finished burger that is in their hand. &#10;         Once a player picks up an order card for their burger, the player cannot modify that burger anymore. &#10;         A player can grab any face-up order card whether or not their burger fulfills the order. If it doesn&rsquo;t fulfill the order exactly, the player may lose points. &#10;    &#10;     Players continue to make orders until one player runs completely out of one of their ingredients. Once they run out they say DONE and everyone must stop what they are doing immediately. &#10;     Players now become the customers and move one spot to the left to verify each burger order is correct for that player.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The number of dice decides where and whether the player may insert a new turtle or let it swim further, or whether a turtle rises or dives. Next, the player may place one of his animals from the island on a turtle. The player's third action is to move all of his animals one turtle further. Each animal (kagu, rabbit, coala, lizard, monkey) has its own properties for movement.&#10;Additionally, the player may play an action card and annoy teammates or defend himself to other teammates.&#10;&#10;In the professional variant, events can occur at the beginning of each round.

Each round players participate in two sets of auctions.&#10;&#10;In the first auction, a set of cards is revealed face up.  In turn order, players point at the cards they want, and in reverse turn order, they either withdraw from the auction, or bid with face down coins.&#10;&#10;Any players that withdrew from the card auction then participate in a second auction for the coins that other players bid in the first auction of the round.&#10;&#10;There is a special coin token which allows a player to automatically win any auction they are involved in.  However, if when refilling the card market a police card is revealed, they conduct an inspection and any player caught holding the black coin must discard a certain number of card they had won.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a certain number of police cards have been revealed, and the person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

READ is for young and old, and the really old can join in too!&#10;&#10;Everyone gets a piece that starts in the start field, and the one whose first name comes first in the alphabet starts.&#10;&#10;You roll the die, which goes from 1-3, and move the number of spaces rolled, then you have to answer a category's question, all depending on which place you landed on.&#10;&#10;If you answer correctly, you get to roll  and move again. If you answer incorrectly, the turn goes on to the next player.&#10;&#10;If you land on a question field, the other players jointly decide which category to answer before they have read the question on the card.

On the iceberg is 30 faced down nuggets to be mined. Each player have 4 plastic penguins as the maximum number of workers per round. Other components are action cards, contract cards, precious metal nuggets and resources.&#10;&#10;At the start of every round, players take turns to place their available workers (penguins) to either harvest resources or mine nuggets on the iceberg through worker-placement. Once enough penguins(as indicated per mining tile) are placed on a mining tile in the iceberg, the precious metal may be mined. At the end of each round, players recall all the penguins, who bring their mined nuggets and resources back with them. Resources may be used to purchase action- or contract cards. The action cards may be played in the next round to upgrade mining skills or to increase the players penguin colony by adding additional (to a maximum of 4) penguins. The nuggets of precious metals and contract cards are kept until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Once all the tiles on the iceberg is mined, the game ends and the players apply their nuggets of precious metals to their contract cards, earning victory points for each completed contract. The player with the most victory points win the game and is declared the Myn Pikkewyn.&#10;&#10;",

Mixing compounds has players laying out chemical cards from the deck to find out what chemicals they must mix based on the fire level in the laboratory (the higher the fire level grows the more volatile the mixtures become). The chemicals mixed can be placed in your available flasks for the turn and the process is repeated until you decide to stop to score or an explosion is triggered by an unstable mixture with certain combos of chemicals in your flasks. The more chemicals you can safely mix the more points you are able to score, but your luck may run short when the wrong chemicals get mixed causing an explosion (and ending your turn without scoring).&#10;&#10;Beaker cards sitting in the middle of the table act as a game timer and indicate the fire level and scoring potential of mixtures.

After placing a card, draw back up to 8.&#10;     When all players have put a card into the closet pile, loosely shuffle it face-down. Dramatically re-read your skeleton sentence and then one-by-one reveal the cards from the closet, saying &ldquo;Shhh&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nope&rdquo; as appropriate. Only the color of the cards in the closet matters for scoring, not the text at the bottom.&#10;     You score a point for each green card in the closet pile and place them in front of you as spoils. (If ALL the cards in the closet are green, you get NO points and they are placed face-down at the bottom of the green deck.) The red cards in the pile are placed face-down underneath the red deck; each of those fails to give you points.&#10;     Turns proceed clockwise and the game ends when players have no more secrets left to reveal. The players with the most scored points are the best at snooping out skeletons, and should be regarded with caution.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Life as an Ant is a competitive strategic game in which players compete to establish their colony of ants as the dominant local ant force.&#10;&#10;The game consist out of modular boards that can be placed in a number of different ways at the start of the game to create a unique game board for each time you play. Each player has a nest or home base, and a number of starting ants. Resources are evenly distributed over the board. There is also 3 decks of colony cards, each consisting of various different types of ants. Lastly there are a set number of larva tokens set on the game board (dependent on the number of players in the game). The goal of the game is to be the first colony in bringing back 4 larva back to the colony and guaranteeing dominance of your colony over all the ants.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turn to take up to 5 resources from the board, these resources can be used to purchase colony cards from on of three decks. These cards represent one of 6 different ant types and is kept in the players hand. Once per round a player may play a card in their hand and place a matching ant type hexagon tile on the board in a continuous path from their nest towards any of the larva tokens. The player who completes a unbroken path towards a larva first, may carry the larva token back to its nest and continue their path towards the next larva. While players with long routes can easily cut off other players from larva and control a large playing area, there are mechanisms that keep all players in the game until close to the end. Players may attack each other with warrior ants and even play a highly valuable flying ant and steal a larva right under the nose of another.&#10;&#10;Once a player returns their 4th larva back to the nest, the game ends and the player wins, becoming the queen ant to rule them all!&#10;&#10;",

The  Ogre King demands a perfect sandwich and he&rsquo;ll only eat the most delectable offering&hellip;May the best Ogre Chef Win.&#10;&#10;What Players Do: Roll two dice, the first dice is a mandatory action that involves taking an ingredient of the indicated type from the supply and putting it on your sandwich. The second dice roll is an optional bonus action that will let you grab additional ingredients, place additional ingredients, steal ingredients or force another chef to remove an ingredient from their sandwich.&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics: The placement of the ingredients has a few rules. Chefs may only use two fingers when placing an ingredient on their sandwich. Critters must be placed standing up. Lettuce and Cheese must be placed over the top of the critters on your sandwich when you place it. Once you have placed a cheese or lettuce, you must place all future critters on top of the top layer of your sandwich, no tucking critters underneath.&#10;&#10;If a critter falls over, you may pick it up one time and attempt to place it again. If you knock anything else over or off of your sandwich during this second attempt, follow the rules for a knocked over or knocked off ingredient.&#10;&#10;If a critter is knocked over but remains on the sandwich, it does not count towards your set of critters at the end, but it is still worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;If a critter or ingredient is knocked off the sandwich, meaning it touches the table in any way, remove it and any ingredients on top of it from your sandwich. Those ingredients are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two modes: Standard Play: Ages 8+ and Basic Play: 5+.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The following year, the set was made available in retail, with the playtest cards replaced with 121 foil reprints. The year after that, a new printing of the Convention Edition was distributed to affiliated local game stores to celebrate the return of in-store play after the lifting of pandemic restrictions.&#10;&#10;Unlike most Magic expansions, Mystery Booster was only printed in English.

Silver bars in the branches generate investment income at the end of each round. Silver bars in the head office can also be loaned to generate income.&#10;&#10;In addition, players can make foreign exchange transfers between the branches and the head office. This allows you to earn commissions on money orders and to invest your bullion until maturity.&#10;&#10;You can also strengthen your branch by staffing it with personnel or paying money to the government office to obtain privileges.&#10;&#10;Dice Placement&#10;&#10;Each player rolls a die each round and places the rolled die on the action square. The player with the higher die roll gets to act first, while the player with the lower die roll gets more powerful effects.&#10;&#10;If a die is placed on a square already occupied by another die, the player pays the difference if the die is smaller than the previous die, and receives the difference if the die is larger. A die cannot be placed on a square with the same number of dice as the one already placed on it.&#10;&#10;The essence of finance, right here!&#10;&#10;Heiho&quot; is a game that successfully incorporates the essence of the financial business, such as money management and foreign exchange transfer, into a game.&#10;&#10;The silver bars and copper coins are made of metal, and the components have also been carefully designed.&#10;&#10;",

The last decade has seen bouts of warfare, outbreaks of plague and seismic political upheaval. The religious authorities are keen to stamp down on sinful behaviour, and witch trials are gathering pace&hellip;&#10;&#10;In The Dregs of Days, players take on the role of neighbours in an East Lothian village. Players are allied in pairs, so gameplay blends competition and cooperation.* The aim is to develop your holding (home) by buying assets from a shared pool. Let your welfare or reputation drop too low, or get convicted of witchcraft, and it's game over!&#10;&#10;Fate cards give players scenarios to navigate, while assets can be used defensively or to attack other players. Optional Story cards offer additional historical context, and each game will feature at least one witch trial, in which accused players try to defend themselves against damning allegations. Gameplay is straightforward while still being moderately strategic. Be prepared for unruly livestock, belligerent neighbours and tales of Satanic orgies, brought to life through colourful quotations from historical records.&#10;&#10;Produced by a team at the University of Warwick, Witch Hunt 1649 comprises two fun and educational games. The aim is to provide a sensitive, non-sensationalised exploration of the witch hunts, promoting understanding of the historical backdrop and empathy for victims. The games are available for sale or free download/online play. All proceeds are donated to charity.&#10;&#10;Alliances do not feature in 2-player games, and are optional in 3-player games. In games with an odd number of players, one player will be unallied.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The last decade has seen bouts of warfare, outbreaks of plague and seismic political upheaval. The religious authorities are keen to stamp down on sinful behaviour, and witch trials are gathering pace&hellip;&#10;&#10;Lying Lips is an easy-to-learn, fast-paced game with two phases. In the trading phase, players swap assets, aiming to collect particular combinations. Meanwhile, gossip about witchcraft spreads around the village, represented by the dangerous Rumour card. Holding on to this card gives you a chance to control the village's narratives and seize victory, but it's a risky strategy! In the trial phase, players take on roles. Can the trial commissioner and jurors identify the scandal-mongerer?&#10;&#10;Lying Lips reflects the importance of words in the witch hunts: accused witches often had a reputation for slandering or cursing others. Optionally, the second phase of the game can be used as a framework for a role-play of a trial.&#10;&#10;Witch Hunt 1649 was developed by a team at the University of Warwick.
