    "Description": "The Kingdom is at the brink of civil war. Diplomats and Chancellors from different parts of the land have come to the King's court to solve the conflicts between the different opposing factions. However, among the Diplomats there is a Traitor - with chaos in his mind. If he can turn the other Diplomats at each other, or eliminate enough Chancellors, total chaos will erupt in the Kingdom, and the Traitor will be greatly rewarded...&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game players are secretly assigned the roles of one Traitor the rest being Senators. Each player receives three advisers (that act like life points) and a counter is placed in the middle of a 20 or 30 (depending on # of players) diplomatic point track. The Senators win by taking the point count to 30 or eliminating the Traitor's all three advisers. The Traitor wind respectively by taking the point count to 0 or when all the advisers of a senator have been eliminated.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game lies in negotiation and bluffing. The game is played using action cards that manipulate the diplomatic point track, number of advisers in the game and the ever useful resource of gold. Much like in Werewolf, the task of the Traitor is to turn the Senators against one other while getting away with actions with which he tries to end the game in his favour.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to create a line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) on the board that contains one of each number (the sum of which equals 45, hence the name of the game).&#10;&#10;Each player has a rack with ten numbers on it. Each turn, he may take one of two actions:&#10;1) Draw a new tile, and:&#10;a) Place a tile from his rack on the board, and add the newly drawn tile to his rack, or;&#10;b) Place the newly drawn tile on the board;&#10;2) Take a tile from the board and replace it with a tile from his rack.&#10;&#10;Whenever a tile is placed on the board, it may not be placed in a row that already contains the same number. The round ends when a player manages to complete one row on the board (or two, in a two player game) while also having completed 'row' on his rack. All players now score points, and a new round starts. The game continues until a agreed-upon number of rounds has been played, or an agreed-upon score is reached.&#10;&#10;Home page: http://www.gameof45.com/&#10;&#10;",

Each player chooses one city (New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle or San Francisco) and each game the fires begin in different districts. The mechanics for the spreading of fires can be fierce, luckily players are given some tools to help contain the fires--however the tools are limited, and will not be able to protect all of your city.&#10;&#10;Prevent as many fatalities as possible, keep your city from burning completely to the ground, and you just might be able to come out on top!&#10;&#10;",

When a player collects a set of clues from the same time period, he or she can attempt to make contact and confirm if the individual they&rsquo;ve been tracking is indeed a fellow time traveler. The player&rsquo;s hunches will often be correct. But invariably these hunches are sometimes wrong, and players have to plan ahead to make sure they&rsquo;re able to deal with feisty natives.&#10;&#10;The first player to rescue five lost time travelers wins.

Most simply, it's an auction game where the characters you buy provide the options you'll have for actions on your turn.  Instead of using the usual approach with character based card games--when cards refer to broad classes of characters such as &quot;thief&quot; or &quot;wizard&quot;--the cards in Bedlam refer to specific characters and they give the game an excellent sense of narrative.  Prepare for some surprises, some backstabbing and plenty of tough decisions.&#10;&#10;I know that, as the game's creator, my own opinion doesn't count for much.  I have to say this is my favorite game of all that I have created.  I'm glad to be able offer it for the first time in this form.

But we&rsquo;re underway with our Humans and Dragon Lords. Shortly we will be making our Halfling Militia available and over time more races from The Uncharted Lands will appear.&#10;&#10;We are developing a set of rules for the game and we hope to have more news for you on when these rules will be available. Right now we have 9 packs of miniatures (5 Iron Dwarf and 4 Orc Raiders) complete, each with 4 figures for foot troops or 3 figures for command.&#10;&#10;We have greens for new figures, including an Orc commander and his brutish bodyguard and a cannon and crew for the Dwarves. We are busy with the design of our Dragon Lords and Humans, both races we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll like when they arrive.&#10;&#10;Over time The Uncharted Lands will grow and new races will begin to unfold. The combination of naval game and land game is a novel one and we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll enjoy both. The Gallery below will give you an idea of what our miniatures look like when painted.&#10;&#10;",

And if the coin lands tails up the turn must be TAKO LO. TAKO HI and TAKO LO affect how many stones&#10;the player can remove from each pile in this turn. Then the player rolls the die and makes note of the value. Next&#10;the player must make a legal move. Legal moves consist of:&#10;1. Taking any number of stones from one pile.&#10;2. Taking an equal number of stones from both piles.&#10;3. Using an option move.&#10;&#10;THE DESIGNER SAYS: As far as I can recall this is the first game I created that I actually committed to paper. I believe I created this game in 1992 or 1993.

Players also score with a number that contains the master number written on it. The first player may not start the game with a scoring number. Then the next player must write another number using these same operations or by doubling, halving, squaring or taking the square root of the previous number. Each number from 1 to 30 may not be used more than once. The games ends when no further unused number between 1 to 30 can be derived from the actual number by the rules.&#10;&#10;This game was presented to Sid Sackson by it author Father Daniel, with whom Sid Sackson exchanged correspondence about games in general.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nuclear Renaissance is a post apocalyptic themed, turn based, table-top strategy game. &#10;It uses 28mm figures and vehicles. Players play a gang of hardened fighters, pitting themselves against others in the wastelands of the future.&#10;&#10;The Tome of Tridlins is a supplement for the game Nuclear Renaissance that really completes the game. The core game rules can be downloaded for free from the Ramshackle website or a printed version can be had from the web store. The Tome of Tridlins adds much more detailed gang design rules, along with a full campaign system and more background.&#10;&#10;The main aspects of playing Nuclear Renaissance that sets it apart from other games are that it is great for multiple players and that the gang creation rules are really versatile.&#10;&#10;The multi player aspect of the game makes it great for gaming groups. Three player games are easily handled, while even five or six players can get through a game in three hours or so. The rules are really designed so that any sized gaming group can have fun together without feeling that the person to go last is at a disadvantage, or that one player has to get left out. The game is biased towards playing campaigns, where players develop their gangs. The new book, the Tome of Tridlins, gives full rules for playing campaigns. This means that players can always get a game in a campaign even if only three people show up for a gaming night! What this comes down to is that gaming groups can easily fit the game around the players that show up and the boards that are available, rather than the other way around.&#10;&#10;The gang creation rules were made with the idea of letting players play any type of gang that fits their fancy. Players can choose to play biker gangs, zombie hordes, all animal beast packs (monsters included), bands of mutants, robot death squads and even military conclaves. Players can even mix them all up, to have robot driven battle trucks packed full of mutants, zombies and wild animals with a mighty hero in charge! Vehicles are fully integrated into the game play and there are comprehensive but simple rules for designing ones that suit your gang. Within the gang design rules, players are set very few limitations. There are hundreds of options for making really unique forces. This complexity is condensed down onto simple gang rosters that can easily hold all the information you need to play with, without having masses of notes, counters, cards and other paraphernalia.&#10;&#10;The problem with having very open gang design is keeping the game balanced. After six years of testing, the final result balances player gangs in a number of ways. The first is a points system, where each player is given a set amount to spend building their gangs. In campaigns the players are awarded more points as they play more games but the campaign system keeps players who miss gaming nights in the loop. Its easy to catch up, even if you lose! The second way to balance the game is that more power leads to less versatility. Power hungry &quot;one man armies&quot; don't get many tactical options and are often left waiting while the other players take their turns with larger gangs. The game works with players alternately activating characters, so gangs with the average ten or so members keep playing throughout a turn.&#10;&#10;The game is aimed at players who want a new gaming system, nothing too complex to learn but with a lot of options. The game features solid mechanics and balance, which means that its robust enough to play well, but loose enough to let players use their imaginations. Power gamers can indulge their lust for super armoured laser cannon wielding death knights mounted on super bikes but will find that the other players in their gaming group will have the flexibility to constantly undermine their power gaming tactics. On the other hand, players who want to concentrate more on the theme of their gang will find that its easy to build forces that are powerful but have plenty of room for idiosyncrasies and whimsey!&#10;&#10;Ramshackle Games already produces hundred of miniatures to play Nuclear Renaissance with. Players will find that most of the options in the books are covered in one form or another, so its easy to get a really thematic gang together right from the get-go.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Boardgame News Spiel 2008 Preview:&#10;&#10;Container: The Second Shipment includes four different expansions that can be mixed and matched as players want. These expansions are:&#10;&#10;Luxury Containers &mdash; In addition to the other containers, players add 12, 16, or 20 gold luxury containers to the supply. As a pre-turn action, a player can convert two containers in his factory or harbor to a gold container, pricing it as he wishes. Luxury containers are worth twice the number of luxury containers that a player collects, so one luxury container is worth 2, two containers are worth 8 (4 each), three are worth 18 (6 each), and so on.&#10;&#10;Factory and Warehouse Restrictions &mdash; These two expansions work similarly, consisting of sets of cards that are stacked in a particular order. As you build more factories (or warehouses), a new restriction card takes effect, limiting the prices at which you can offer containers. In effect, these cards mimic economies of scale, allowing players to drop prices as they invest more in infrastructure.&#10;&#10;Financiers &mdash; Players can now loan money directly to others, allowing them to earn the interest previously paid to the bank. A player who is looking for financing doesn't have to accept a loan offered by another player, but if she doesn't, then she must pass on borrowing money at all that turn. Competing Financiers may sweeten the deal by offering bigger loans for the same interest payment. Someone who defaults on a loan from another player will typically lose a container, factory, or warehouse to the lender to repay the debt.&#10;&#10;Monopoly &mdash; A single player can now have more than one factory of the same color, potentially monopolizing production of a container type.&#10;&#10;",

And he's about to launch a deadly attack on the real world. Only you can stop him!&#10;&#10;You and your friends must transform into VR Troopers and enter the mysterious world of virtual reality - just like on the exciting TV show! Toss the battle dice top smash the sinister Skugs. Your powers increase as you defeat them. Then fight the fiendish robot mutant General Ivar! But watch out! He'll stop at nothing to destroy you!&#10;&#10;Only the bravest VR Troupers can defeat Grimlord's evil army and win the game. Will it be you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Unlike most other games, the three VR warriors in the game are shared by the players.  Each turn, the active player throws a die to decide which (red, yellow or green) trooper he controls this time, and then battle a Skug on their way to the penultimate battle, General Ivar.&#10;&#10;Battles are done by tossing dice into a battle arena.  Someone plays the Skug and tosses one die, hoping for a hit (50% chance), and then the active player tosses a die to get a hit as well.  Play continues with 2 more dice on each side , one at a time. The dexterity comes in that you can try to hit your opponent's 'hit' die or your own 'miss' die to switch the result.  Ties go to the active player.&#10;&#10;There is some skill in tossing the dice to change results, but because you cannot control which VR warrior you will assumer on your turn, the game comes down mainly to luck.  Winning battlers earns you a power chip (with a VR glasses wearing dog on it), which will allow you a reroll in the final battle (which is a toss of 4 dice at once, so dexterity plays no role here), while losing a battle loses you the same number of accumulated power chips.&#10;&#10;There's no doubt this is a kid's game for fans of the TV show.  Still, the components are fairly nice and the battle arena mechanic is well done.&#10;&#10;",
