    "Description": "SIMSOC (pronounced sim'-sock), a unique social process game, was developed to make social science more vivid than has been possible with traditional teaching methods.  It is designed to be played WITHOUT the use of a computer.  SIMSOC is a way to actively involve students in processes of large-scale conflict, protest, social control, and social change.  SIMSOC creates a situation in which the participants must actively question the nature of social order.&#10;&#10;Included are: Rules for playing, materials needed for play and questions to guide discussions afterward.  Materials are provided on perforated sheets and include: SimBucks of various denominations, travel passes, sustenance tickets, and coupons which can be exchanged for &quot;munchies&quot; during the game (representing luxuries).  Also included are play-aids, scenario leaflets and several puzzle sheets that are distributed to players as wage-earning jobs.&#10;&#10;Players are citizens of a simulated modern international society taking on roles of political and industrial leaders, workers, the media, the judiciary and the unemployed.  Some randomly selected players may be &quot;Minorities&quot; (wearing masks or armbands) and can be victims of prejudice at any time by the other players.  Players attempt to deal with scenarios presented each session while attaining personal goals and maintaining a viable society.&#10;&#10;SIMSOC is best with approximately 40 participants, and is intended to be played in 5 to 10 sessions of about an hour apiece.  Rules adjustments are included to support smaller groups and fewer, abbreviated sessions.  Space should be available to divide the players into 4 groups (or 3 for smaller games) preferably in separate rooms, although corners of a large room will suffice.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seafood Palace is a medium-weight resource management and auction game for three to five players aged 10 years and older. Games usually last from 60 to 90 minutes. The game features an innovative dice drafting mechanism for players to obtain resources used in bidding for cards which yield points. Each turn, players have a variety of actions available to them and tempo is an important consideration &ndash; it may be good to get a bid in first to win a card cheaply, but at the cost of taking a high value die instead.&#10;&#10;In Seafood Palace, players take on the role of Chinese seafood restaurant owners in Singapore, seeking to gain fame points by bidding to satisfy public demand for tasty seafood dishes. The more resources you put into the dish, the more likely that people will identify that dish with your restaurant, and this recognition is represented by fame points.&#10;&#10;Every player starts with stores of fish, prawn, crab, non-seafood resources (chicken and vegetable), beverages and coins. The resources are represented by counters on the player&rsquo;s own board, which represents the player&rsquo;s stores.&#10;&#10;Each round, public demand is represented by dish cards that become available for auction. Players bid to satisfy the demand with the corresponding resources and the highest bid wins the card and the fame points on the card.&#10;&#10;Each round, new resource dice and number dice are available for players to replenish stores.  These dice are traded in as pairs (one of each kind) to get the specified number of the specified type of resource (e.g. a 5-number die and a crab resource die are traded in for 5 crab resources).&#10;&#10;There are also bonus cards which could permit special actions to benefit the player - some of the bonus action cards include discounts on buying seafood resources, using MSG to get an advantage over your competitors (but with a penalty) or the abundant catch that helps you stock up on seafood. Bonus cards could also be set menus, which if fulfilled by the end of the game, will yield bonus points. A wedding banquet menu is valuable, and this game also caters to vegetarians with a vegetarian set menu. If you hire a master chef, your lowly 1-point dishes will increase in value.&#10;&#10;The twist is that players have to choose which of several actions they want to take (take a die, bid on a dish, claim a dish, bid on a bonus card, claim a bonus card, or pass) and focusing on one action means sacrificing the tempo to carry out another action. If you decide to go for the high number die, someone else could take the resource die of the type you need badly, and yet another will get in a bid on a valuable card that you can&rsquo;t outbid because you haven&rsquo;t managed to obtain the right dice yet &hellip;&#10;&#10;The game lasts enough rounds so that each player has the advantage of going first an equal number of times. At the end of the game, players score fame points for dish cards they have won, set menus they have fulfilled with their dishes, and recognition for having the best stocked cellar (player with the most beverages) and best seafood stocks (player whose least seafood resource is greater than other players&rsquo; least seafood resource). The player with the most famous restaurant wins.&#10;&#10;Seafood Palace was accepted for play-testing in the 2008 Hippodice competition&#10;&#10;",

The highest cards, winning cards, court cards and low cards (whose definition varies depending on number of players) are discarded after each bid. As each route is won it is coloured on the map to show its ownership, a la crayon rail games.&#10;&#10;Each route is worth between 1 and 5 distance points. The winner is the player with the longest continuous route on the map when the 25 routes have all been won (or when all players are out of cards).&#10;&#10;Simple but fun.

The wooden playing board has a pair of book-like spines on one side and the illusion of book pages on the others, with an outer slip case to hold everything together. The set also contains a dual arrowed spinning indicator which its makers proclaimed as &quot;A Complete and Unobjectional Substitute for, and Improvement on Dice, Teetotums, &amp;c.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the basic Pilgrim's Progress game, played on the outer board halves, a player must move both of his pieces (two pawns: a Pilgrim and a Staff) by the number of spaces indicated by the dual spinner until he reaches the Giant Despair space. He then moves his Pilgrim alone until it lands by exact count on the Golden Gate, and thence (if not displaced) to victory in the Celestial City. Rules for three other variants are also included. These use various combinations of board spaces and require differing numbers of pieces.&#10;&#10;In Going to Sunday School, played in one of the inner board halves, players spin and move around the board. Essentially, the player that lands on the most picture spaces (10 special spaces, each illustrating a virtue or a vice) is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Tower of Babel, played in the other inner board half, combines a race for the top of the tower with a race to the bottom. Different rules apply to each race within the game. The winners of each half have a spin-off to determine the overall winner.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     Rule booklet&#10;     12 round-headed (Pilgrim) wood pawns&#10;     6 pointed-headed (Staff) wood pawns&#10;     Dual arrowed spinner&#10;     Wooden game board&#10;     Slip case&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players must find a matching key to use the car.  Once the cars are in play they can be used to move quicker, run down zombies, or serve as makeshift barricades.&#10;&#10;Hidden agendas are cards similar in size to the existing cards for the game.  Each agenda has two possible conditions worth additional victory points.  Players must choose one of them and reveal it when the conditions are met.  If the conditions are later lost, the player retains his VP.  The agendas on a card are related, so one might offer 5 points for having homes on two sides of the board and 10 for having homes on three sides.&#10;&#10;Publisher's Page: http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/zombietown/zombietown2.php&#10;&#10;Expands&#10;&#10;    ZombieTown&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BSO FOOTBALL&#10;THE HISTORY OF PRO FOOTBALL&#10;&#10;For fans of Tabletop Sports games, and Football, here is one of, if not THE, best solitaire play football card/board game ever. BSO FOOTBALL provides its players with remarkable statistical accuracy in almost every category, in the most accessible, playable form in the game industry. There&rsquo;s no trying to outguess yourself on offense or defense. You just call the play and roll the dice (which you provide). Player Cards, one for every offensive player on the team, the Defensive Ratings on the Team Charts, and the Results Tables do the rest.&#10;&#10;Check the sample Player Cards, above, to see how players are rated.&#10;&#10;The Team Charts provide the ratings/information for Defense, Interceptions, Clutch Play,  Fumbles, Penalties, and the full range of Returns and Kicking details. They also have Extra Information on Special and Unusual plays that team used. The Charts include Rushing, Pass Completion, Pass Gain and Return, Out-of-Bounds, Medium and Long Gains, Kickoff (including Onside Kicks), Punting (including Blocked Kicks), and a full range of Penalties.&#10;&#10;The Game Clock is also extremely accurate, with each quarter using 180 &ldquo;points&rdquo;, each point equal to 5 seconds. A normal play would use 8 points, but an incomplete pass or Time Out only 1.&#10;&#10;The first edition of BSO FOOTBALL brings you one of the greatest seasons in the History of Football, 1958, with the famous overtime Championship game between the Colts and the Giants. In the East the Giants and the Cleveland Browns, led by the great Jim Brown, had to use a playoff game to determine the winner, and the Steelers, led by the veteran Bobby Layne, were not that far behind. In the West, the Colts beat out both the Bears and Rams by one game.&#10;&#10;Some of Pro Football&rsquo;s greats are present:  Ollie Matson, Norm Van Brocklin, Johnny Unitas, Jon Arnett, Y. A. Tittle, and the first glimpses of Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, and Paul Hornung, all playing for one of the worst Green Bay teams ever (1-10-1)! And wait&rsquo;ll you see the average yards per pass catch!  Steeler rookie, Jimmy Orr, led the league with 27.6, with many others not far behind.&#10;&#10;For gamers who like to play entire seasons and revel in great statistical accuracy, BSO FOOTBALL is unbeatable. And, if you wish, there are special rules for face-to-face play, which use extended play calling (although, to be up front, that is not the game&rsquo;s strong point).&#10;&#10;player cards:  150&#10;team cards&rdquo;  12&#10;others:  Charts, Schedules, Rules&#10;cost:  $14 US; $15 Canada; $17 Pacific&#10;&#10;",

The figures move around the board reaching places that represent school, the bus, home, the mall and other places a child might be. Children are asked questions about hypothetical situations - some social, some life-threatening - and asked to tell what they would do. Adult cards ask parents to answer questions about their own childhoods. When children are empowered by correct responses and adult reinforcement, their lives will be safer. Discussing these issues can help a kid to act smart, not scared if they find themselves in certain circumstances.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flix was distributed as a single game containing three rule variants (Lucky Flix, Pay-Off Flix, and Tac-T-Flix).  The basic goal is to get 4 taxpayer men in a row on a three dimensional gameboard.  Specialized dice are used to limit the color and placement of pieces on the &quot;Spaceboard&quot;.  In Tac-T-Flix, Burocrats, a second type of game piece, are introduced.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;One rules sheet says:&#10;&#10;     54 flexible taxpayer men (in three colors for the different players&#10;     24 Burocrat[sic] Men (8 of each color)&#10;     3 special Flix dice&#10;     12 Numbered Tokens&#10;&#10;&#10;So there are 18 &quot;taxpayer men&quot; and 8 &quot;burocrat[sic] men&quot; in eaach of the three colors. The men are made from looks to be a drinking straw. The top on both is cut off at about a 60 degree angle to give a very pointy appearance. Presumably this is the end that you'd stick in first through the board holes. The bottoms of the taxpayer men are cut off straight across, however the burocrat[sic] men are notched into a &quot;V&quot; and are longer.&#10;&#10;The numbered tokens are a card sheet with 12 very thin strips that are meant to be cut off. The strips have a number on them. The set is six 10's, three 25's, two 50's, and one 100. The idea is that when the strip is folded in half that the number is hidden when stuffed inside a &quot;straw piece.&quot; The numbered tokens are only used in the  game Pay Off Flix by folding them in half and randomly splitting the 12 token between the two players.&#10;&#10;Also see:&#10;Qubic which is 4x4x4 tic-tac-toe&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "GAME SUMMARY:&#10;Towers&amp;Bridges is a board game for two players. It combines traditional elements of chess &mdash;such as a squared board&mdash; with original pieces and movements. The game symbolizes a battle between two feudal lords: the White Lord and the Black Lord. Each one leads an army composed by attack towers and portable bridges.&#10;The principal aim of attack towers is to capture enemy castles. But these are surrounded by deep moats. Portable bridges are used to cover those moats. In this way, towers can cross moats; and thus, they can take castles&hellip; but only if the tower is as high as the castle. Most attack towers are initially smaller than most castles. However, they can get bigger by capturing an enemy tower. When this happens, the stages of the defeated tower are added to the winning one. So, winning attack towers become higher and higher. In the end, they may even match the highest castle: that is, the enemy lord&rsquo;s one.&#10;During the combat, both contenders may be helped by mercenaries and flying creatures. But these are jailed in strong citadels, so first of all, attack towers must free them. Once they have been liberated, mercenaries can blow enemy bridges up; and winged creatures can transport their lord by air, crossing even moats not covered by bridges.&#10;The main purpose in the game is to trap the opponent&rsquo;s feudal lord, who takes shelter in the highest castle. The player who gets this objective wins.&#10;&#10;NOTES:&#10;-This information was submitted by the publisher.&#10;-The game has been published in English and Spanish.&#10;-The game has been published as a book. Besides the rules and a game example, the book contains the cut-out board and pieces, both in duplicate.&#10;-Towers&amp;Bridges in English is available at: http://www.lulu.com/content/2687006&#10;-In Spanish at: http://www.lulu.com/content/1354342&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game involving luck, good timing and knowing the odds.&#10;&#10;The game is a push your luck game for up to four players. Each turn a player rolls five dice and tries to advance along a linear track which marks the players score. To win, players must land on the &quot;1200 points&quot; space exactly.&#10;&#10;Four dice are numbered 1-5 and 10, and the fifth is a &quot;wild&quot; dice, which has at least one side labeled &quot;wild.&quot; Points are scored for rolling 5's and 10's, and also for rolling straights, three of a kind etc., in a similar manner to Yahtzee. After rolling players have the option of holding scoring dice (5's or 10's) or rolling.&#10;&#10;However if a non-scoring combination is rolled, players lose points rolled in the current round.&#10;&#10;The score track also features way stations, which earn the players &quot;Opportunity points.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
