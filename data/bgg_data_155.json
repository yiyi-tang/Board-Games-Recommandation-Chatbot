    "Description": "The City of Heroes Customizable Card Game (COHCCG) was designed by David Williams and produced by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG). There were a total of two sets of cards released for the game. The first, Arena, was released in January, 2006. The second set, Secret Origins, was released in October, 2006. Since then, there have been no official releases.&#10;&#10;The COHCCG was designed to be a quick game. Rather than using a turn structure where each player takes multiple actions in a row, the game used an alternating action structure. This lead to faster and more interactive games. Each player was represented by a Hero card, which began play with 2 starting powers. As their action, a player had many choices, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play a card, being:&#10;         a Sidekick&#10;         a Power that can be used by the Hero or a Sidekick&#10;         an Enhancement on a Power already in play&#10;         an Edge card with the keyword &quot;Action&quot; or &quot;React&quot;&#10;    &#10;    Activate a Power already in play&#10;    Move the Hero or a Sidekick&#10;    Search your draw deck for a Sidekick&#10;    Recharge your Powers&#10;    Play a Mission card&#10;    Use the Defeat text on a mission to complete it&#10;    Draw 2 cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Unless otherwise specified by the cards played, play continued until only one Hero remained, who was declared the winner.&#10;&#10;In addition to the 33 Heroes available in Arena and the 22 Heroes available in Secret Origins, players could create their own hero using &quot;Paragon&quot; Hero cards. These cards allowed a player to create new combinations of powers that were not available on existing Hero cards. Players could either play solely with the Paragon Hero cards available in the Arena set, or go online to access the HeroBuilder which allowed players to create Hero cards in the same template as the already available Heroes, including a picture uploaded by the player.&#10;&#10;After the game was discontinued, a fan community effort created the Hamidon set.  Although the generic Hero cards listed all power sets available to the archetypes at the time, it wasn't until The Hamidon set was developed that many of those power sets were codified for use.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In June 1944, American Marines and soldiers stormed ashore on Saipan, a large island in the Central Pacific whose possession would put Allied heavy bombers in range of Japanese cities. Three weeks of savage fighting would finally see the island secured, as places like Death Valley, Hell&rsquo;s Pocket and Purple Heart Ridge entered the U.S. Marine Corps&rsquo; lexicon. The campaign saw the largest tank battle of the Pacific war, and also its largest banzai charge as almost the entire Japanese garrison (and much of the island&rsquo;s Japanese civilian population) chose death over surrender.&#10;&#10;Panzer Grenadier: Saipan 1944 is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these fearsome battles. Designer Jay Townsend has provided 40 scenarios. There are four new mapboards by artist Guy Riessen showing the jungles, hills, beaches and cane fields of Saipan. And 495 playing pieces: 330 superb die-cut counter combat units and 165 die-cut markers.&#10;&#10;The U.S. Marines have awesome firepower &ndash; every third man wields an automatic rifle &ndash; and bring tanks, flamethrowers and heavy artillery to the battlefield. The U.S. Army is present, along with the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Navy&rsquo;s elite Special Naval Landing Forces.&#10;&#10;",

Roles can be viewed and switched several times before all is said and done, then the final vote takes place.&#10;&#10;As in One Night Ultimate Werewolf, your goal is to figure out the secret roles of your opponents as well as your own role by the end of the game. Each day, you enter a different room with a unique ability, and each night you interact with the other players in that room. In addition to the 3-7 players, three staff members roam the castle, and each of them also has a secret role. After a week's investigation (which should take about 45 minutes), it all comes down to a vote. If you're a werewolf, you're trying to remain undiscovered. If you're a villager, you're trying to find those sneaky werewolves. And if you're a Tanner, well, you're trying to get caught!&#10;&#10;One Week Ultimate Werewolf comes with more than a dozen unique rooms. You play with just a few each game, making each game different.&#10;&#10;",

None of the tiles include a whole piece of candy; they have only halves &mdash; four halves actually, one on each side of the square tiles, so we have to combine our tiles with the ones on the table to complete one, two, or even three candies. Some candies are worth one point, others two points, and some of them let us play an additional tile.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a wall of candy tiles on the table, all of them placed randomly. Players receive three tiles, and they play one per turn, placing it on the table and taking as many tiles as pieces of candy that have been completed. The tiles don't have to match every single side, so if we place a tile touching three others but only matching two of the sides, we take those two tiles and leave the rest. We keep aside the tiles that we get from the table as they are our points. The tile that we played stays on the table, and we receive a new one at the end of our turn so that we always have three from which to choose. Whoever gets the most candies wins!&#10;&#10;",

The team with the Tossit closest to the Jack wins the round and scores one point for each of it Tossits that is closer than the opposing team's closest Tossit.

It was inhabited by a civilization that had extraordinary cultural and technological achievements, especially in architecture and art.&#10;&#10;All that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible if they hadn&rsquo;t been blessed by the gods, who the Atlants honored by building glorious monuments for them. And the gods didn&rsquo;t mind that they weren&rsquo;t the only ones being cherished by the Atlants. Alas, the plan of the gods was not perfect. Things went awry because of the younger generation of the gods.&#10;&#10;Specifically it was Ares, the son of Zeus and Hera, whose actions resulted in the disaster. His wickedness was endless, and the cruelty of his followers and the destruction they caused initiated civil war in the land that had only known peace. The emerged conflict divided both the Atlants and their deities. Before those events, the gods had taken pleasure in watching their folk grow, but then they started to interfere with the people&rsquo;s affairs as well as fight one another. Some of the old gods had predicted that this civilization would eventually collapse due to the ever growing conflict between the deities. Conflict in which people&rsquo;s lives would mean nothing.&#10;&#10;So, they decided to protect their followers by sending numerous visions to their priests or by taking a human form and acting as prophets. They would warn Atlants that the end was nigh and tell them about distant lands that could be their only hope for survival.&#10;&#10;Rage of the gods kept growing until one day the eldest one, Nammu, the creator of the primeval sea, in her despair decided to end the Atlants&rsquo; suffering by sinking the island. With the help of their gods some of the Atlants managed to survive. They arrived at various parts of the world, bringing their knowledge to the cultures emerging there.&#10;&#10;In Atlantis: Island of Gods players are the highest priests of the mythological gods, for whom they erect monuments on the mythical island of Atlantis right before its doom. It's a logical card game with four boards representing the regions of Atlantis.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players take five actions during which they can recruit new followers of their deity, celebrate feasts in their honor, and build new temples. The goal of the game is to be the first to build all the temples of the player's deity which grants them god's favor and survival of the imminent catastrophe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NMBR 9 ++ includes four sets of numbers 0-9, as well as twenty number cards (0-9 twice), so with this box you can play NMBR 9 with only two players. Alternatively, if you already have NMBR 9, you can now play the game with up to six players at once.&#10;&#10;NMBR 9 ++ also includes expansion components that you can use with this box or with the original NMBR 9 game or with both combined. You have six different starting tiles, for example, with each player taking one at random before the game begins, which makes it impossible for players to build in the same patterns as one another.&#10;&#10;You can give each player two &quot;gap filler&quot; tiles &mdash; one that is a single square and a second that is two squares long. You can use one or both at any point in the game when you're placing a number tile.&#10;&#10;You can deal out two of the six &quot;rule breaker&quot; cards, then give each player two cubes in a different color. During the game, if you want to use a &quot;rule breaker&quot; card &mdash; e.g., move a tile previously placed, place the current tile upside down, or reserve the tile for placement later &mdash; place one of your cubes on the card, then use its power. You can use each card only once.&#10;&#10;Finally, NMBR 9 ++ includes variant rules that can be used with 1-4 players. In &quot;2 out of 3&quot;, you create a deck of thirty cards (0-9 thrice) and put all of the number tiles on the table. Each round, you reveal three cards one by one. Each player can place the first number tile revealed or refuse it; if they refuse it, they must place the next two number tiles; if they place it, they must refuse one of the next two tiles. In the end, everyone will place twenty number tiles, as in the basic game.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Level to Level&quot;, shuffle all forty cards into a deck, place all number tiles on the table, and lay out new tokens numbered 0-4. For the first two turns, draw a card and placed it under 0; each player must place this number tile in front of them following the usual rules. For the third turn, flip a card into both the 0 slot and 1 slot; the tile showing under 0 can be placed only on the ground level and the tile under 1 can be placed only on the first level. You can refuse to place either or both tiles.&#10;&#10;Once a player has two tiles on the first level, next turn flip a card under slots 0, 1, and 2, with the latter number tile being placed only on the second level. Continue play until the deck runs out or you can't flip enough cards to start a turn.&#10;&#10;",

The difference between first and second place in Brazilian Carnaval can be as little as one-tenth of a point, so minimizing your losses in one category can be as important as maximizing your scores in the rest! The samba school with the highest score at the end of the game is the champion of this year&rsquo;s Carnaval parade, and you will always be remembered as being the carnavalesco who led it to victory!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bitskrieg is the game of tiny tank battles. Each player gets a platoon of five tanks and maneuvers on an 8&times;8 grid to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s tanks. Nobody knows why they have it in for each other. Are they fighting over a simple misunderstanding? The last slice of pizza? Arctic water rights? What&rsquo;s important is that they will stop at nothing to destroy each other, except maybe flags. They might stop to sit on some flags.&#10;&#10;Bitskrieg is designed to be simple enough to be played with children or grandchildren, while still providing enough tactical challenge to interest wargaming adults. With fewer than forty counters and a single page of rules, Bitskrieg packs a lot of punch in a tiny package.&#10;&#10;Terrain is arranged randomly on an eight-by-eight square grid, and players choose sides. You choose your force of five tanks from four different types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses: light, medium, and heavy tanks, and tank destroyers. Place your two flags and the battle is on! You win by destroying all enemy tanks or by capturing both enemy flags.&#10;&#10;Play in Bitskrieg alternates with each player activating one tank to move or fire, or using their turn to refresh all their previously-activated tanks. Fire involves simple counting of range and rolling a die to hit, then rolling a die for penetration after a successful hit to destroy the target.&#10;&#10;Optional advanced rules include flanking, ramming, bounding fire, stun, terrain types, and more. Bitskrieg handicaps easily, so if luck is not enough for your young one to turn the tables on you, you can customize the experience to find the right balance.&#10;&#10;",

In Peter's Two Sheep Dogs, players act as two sheep dogs, calling the animals with a loud voice and chasing off the wolf. Compete to be Peter's best sheep dog by herding the animals from the grassland, into the fence, and finally to the hut.&#10;&#10;The player aims to become a sheep dog and collect many animals into their navery. Three livestock animals &mdash; sheep, pig, cow &mdash; score points, while the wolf eats the livestock and eliminates points. As a result, players balance moving the wolves to threaten the opponent while also gathering livestock for themselves.&#10;&#10;However, because both trick-taking and mancala rules are mixed together, it will not be easy. Basically winning a trick allows players to collect animals in their grasslands. The player who loses the trick picks one of their grasslands and performs the movement action. If you can chase animals perfectly toward your or your opponent's goal fence, you can gain additional action opportunities and an even better score.&#10;&#10;During the game you have opportunities for scorings in spring and summer, and if the score obtained in summer is lower than the score obtained in spring, the summer score becomes 0 points. However, if the score obtained in summer is more than twice the score of spring, your spring score is doubled.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pizza Master was the master chef of Wizards of Pizza, once known as the best pizza restaurant in the world. However, after the master chef mysteriously disappeared, its reputation has been on the decline. To reclaim number one spot, all talented Pizza Trainees assemble and hold a COMPETITION. The one who is truly skilled and able to earn the most reputation will be named the next &ldquo;Pizza Master&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Pizza Master is a strategy board game for 2-5 players. You are one of the Wizards of Pizza trainees who aspire to become the Pizza Master. Your job is to buy ingredients, collect the ones you want, and make pizzas to earn reputation points.&#10;&#10;What makes these seemingly simple tasks challenging is that ingredients might run out as trainees all share the same refrigerator. Moreover, greedy rookies who bite off more than they can chew will be punished for wasting ingredients.&#10;&#10;As you are one of the Pizza Trainees, don&rsquo;t let this chance flies away. Plan your menu well to prove that you are worthy of the title Pizza Master!&#10;&ldquo;&hellip;Fire up your spirits, all the Pizza Trainees&hellip;&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Pizza Master can be played in 3 different modes, with increasing difficulties: Beginner, Trainee, and Master.&#10;&#10;Game-play overview (in Beginner mode) :&#10;&#10;A game is played in rounds until a trainee reaches 50 reputation points. A round consists of 6 phases.&#10;&#10;(1) Start the day - Each trainee draws 4 pizza menu cards.&#10;&#10;(2) Shopping - In turn order, each trainee takes 4 coins and must spend them to buy ingredients (cheese, vegetable, seafood and meat). After all trainees finish shopping, all ingredients go to the shared refrigerator (the centre of the board).&#10;&#10;(3) Collecting - In reverse turn order, each trainee takes turns collecting one ingredient token from the board to their own cooking tray. Once you pass, you cannot take any more ingredient token for this round.&#10;&#10;BE CAREFUL IT'S SHARED REFRIGERATOR THAT OTHER TRAINEES CAN PICK YOURS&#10;&#10;(4) Making Pizzas - Trainees make as many pizzas as they can by spending ingredient tokens that are required on pizza menu cards.&#10;&#10;(5) Scoring - Trainees are rewarded reputation points for completed pizza menu cards. The total is then subtracted by the number of unused ingredient tokens on the cooking tray.&#10;&#10;(6) End of the day - Trainees discard all ingredient tokens. The turn order is then re-determined by reputation points.&#10;&#10;Special rules :&#10;&#10;1.Beginner mode : no special rule.&#10;2.Trainee mode : Objective Cards, reserving and exchanging ingredient mechanics.&#10;3.Master mode : Trainee Mode + Daily Missions, and all trainees SHARE Pizza Menu Cards!&#10;&#10;",

The player can play a single match, or with multiple games, simulate an entire league season. Many expansion sets of additional leagues and championships are available separately.&#10;&#10;The basic game is simple and short (usually under 5 minutes), only determining if goals have been scored during the match by using the two teams' attack and defense ratings, chance cards, and a die rolls to see if a goal was scored.  Additional rules add the ability to identify scoring players and the time of the goal, and noting injuries and suspensions of players.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's site:&#10;The Beautiful Game has been awarded the TABLETOP GAME OF THE DECADE by Jamie Marshall's 'Sports Digest'&#10;&#10;The game includes the most current English Premier League teams available at time of printing&#10;&#10;Watch a football match, live or on television, enjoy the action, the mid-field struggle,the joy of victory for your team, the despair of defeat, but a few hours after the final whistle what do you remember ? I suspect mainly the dramatic bits, the goals, the great saves, the near misses, the chances scorned. So that's exactly what you get in 'The Beautiful Game', those brief moments that decided the match, for better or worse, the bits that make up your memories, the talking points, the incidents that stay with you at least until next match day.&#10;&#10;'The Beautiful Game' (henceforward 'BG') is an accurate replay game, accurate in results that is, and goal scorers, but unlike most soccer replay games it requires no user-decisions (which will appeal to some but not all) and is fast to play, just four to ten minutes per match, depending on how much you want to know in terms of stats.&#10;&#10;For 'BG' is a layer game, three layers in this case, the basic quick-result is layer one, add on some personality with goal scorers, times of goals, that's layer two, and get involved in some simple book-keeping by recording (generic) bookings and injuries and rewarding winning form, plus adding some 'joining up' commentary, that's layer three. Even with all three layers most matches will take no more than 6-7 minutes, unless it's a real cracker !&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls two prisoners as they make their way through the winding labyrinth of a space prison, trying to collect enough oxygen to survive while denying their opponents the same. The goal is to collect as many points as possible (represented by oxygen tiles of different colors and values), located inside a maze formed by hexagonal tiles. Players must move across the maze and collect the points before their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game has two phases: construction and competition. In the construction phase, players take turns placing tiles and creating the the board (maze). Then the competition phase begins, where players move around the maze attempting to collect more points (oxygen) than their opponents. Where players place their tiles is of utmost strategic importance in the construction phase: Sector 6&acute;s building system allows strategic planning while the maze is being created. In the absence of a predefined configuration, each game takes place on an entirely new board. There are essentially an infinite amount of setup configurations which allows for high replay value.&#10;&#10;But building a good maze and moving quickly will not be enough to achieve victory. During the game, Sector 6's maze will be in constant motion, as players can rotate the tiles, thereby changing the layout of the maze, potentially allowing players to block their opponents or create new pathways to reach the points faster. So it won't be the fastest player who wins, but the one who learns how to best use the intricacies of the maze to their own advantage and to the detriment of their opponents!&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of the game, each Master will construct an army of animated Puppets by making use of the Work Benches scattered about the board.&#10;&#10;Puppets are small-minded creatures. They resemble their living counterparts but have only a slight memory of how to function once they become animated and sometimes they are confused about their roles. But watch out! They&rsquo;re vicious when organized into an army!&#10;&#10;Your goal is to destroy the competition and protect your Master, while retaining control of those valuable Work Benches. If ever your Master is killed, or you lose control of all your Work Benches, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;Puppet Wars includes components for two players, including the following puppet miniatures: Lady Justice, Seamus, Judge, Bete Noire, Misaki, Rusty Alyce, Executioner, Death Marshal, Austringer, Rotten Belle, Nurse, Punk Zombie, December Acolyte, Razorspine Rattler, Silurid, Malifaux Cherub, Ronin, Convict Gunslinger.

The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race. Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.&#10;&#10;Each driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race. There is also a pit stop table which controls how many turns you must sit in the pits before re-entering the race.&#10;&#10;The game is driven on Stats and can be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;",

Everything is going so fast!&#10;&#10;Safari Splash! is a game for 2-6 players of ages 8+, that plays in just 90 seconds. At the beginning of the game each player gets a reminder card and a scoring card (there are 4 different levels of scoring, of increasing complexity). The 120 safari cards are randomized and placed face down in a disorganized pile, within the reach of all players.&#10;&#10;The scoring card serves as the starting point of each player's river, and also depicts the preferred (and maybe disliked) animal(s) for the player. The game is played in real time (it counts with an app support) and players will be taking face down cards from the safari pile, flipping them over, and adding them to their river. The deal is that each safari card back depicts 3 animals, but only 2 of them are present on the card front. So players need to select the safari cards carefully, and then place them in their area so that they form a continuous river.&#10;&#10;When a player takes and flips a card containing a whirlpool, they shout &quot;SPLASH!&quot; and each player gives the safari card they're holding to the player to their left.&#10;&#10;Once the time is up, players verify the integrity of their river, and then count points according to their scoring card. The player with the most points makes a big splash and wins the game!&#10;&#10;Safari Splash! has different sets of victory conditions so it is playable by a wide range of ages.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game about an encounter battle of gargantuan proportions in north Italy...&#10;&#10;On a brutally hot day in June 1859, on the 24th, three armies clashed. The French, under the command of Napoleon III, the Piedmontese under Victor Emmanuel II and the Austrians under Franz Josef (the famous husband of the Empress Sisi!). A quarter of a million men. &#10;The largest battle on European soil since Waterloo.&#10;Each of them unaware of the enemy&rsquo;s positions, that they all expected to be further away, the three armies were to fight an encounter battle of gargantuan proportions.  &#10;The battle took place on three fronts. In the north, between the Piedmontese and the talented Benedek&rsquo;s VIIIth Corps; in the centre around the village of Solferino, place of terrible, bloody, hand to hand fighting; and in the south, on the plains of Medole and Guidizzolo, where the French would try in vain to turn the Austrians&rsquo; left wing. &#10;Broken off by a storm of a rare intensity, the battle was to end in a gigantic human tragedy. Europe had not seen as much bloodshed for more than 40 years. 30,000 dead and wounded, 10,000 missing or prisoners of war, another 40,000 sick after the battle due to the makeshift hygienic conditions and lack of provisions.&#10;&#10;This game has already been published by the excellent (even if French too...) Vae Victis. This is a reworked and rewritten version, designed for easier play.  Thanks to the topographical talents of Riccardo Rinaldi, the map is an accurate and realistic representation of the historical battlefield. The game system uses a simple table to achieve morale results for fire combat and assault, where units are tested against their morale/cohesion value. The sequence of play with defensive fire during an assault is the standard solution for 19th century battles, and here it works! &#10;The game has high replayability value with many interesting nuances, which we hope you will experience. Playing time for a game is between 3 and 5 hours. And, without spoiling anything in &#10;the game, it also plays very well solitaire.&#10;&#10;Scale - Turn: 1 hour . Hexagon: 600 meters. Units: brigades&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One player commands the French forces, the other the Austrians. The map is an accurate representation of the battlefield, the counters represent the forces which took part, and rules on movement, combat, leadership and morale reflect the problems and possibilities which faced the historical commanders.&#10;&#10;The scale of the combat is that one strength point represent 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 guns, each turn is 35 minutes; each hex is 600 yards. Victory is determined my control of objective hexes and loss inflicted on the enemy.&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;Eckmuhl is a complete game in itself. It can also be played as a &ldquo;campaign game&rdquo; linked with another of 3W&rsquo;s Bonaparte series, The Battle of Abensberg (in S&amp;T #113). Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios were provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. A further dozen scenarios will be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&amp;T #115 (Kanev). These later scenarios link the two games.&#10;&#10;Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #116 adds two more scenarios and a Q&amp;A by the designer.&#10;&#10;",

To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.&#10;&#10;The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!&#10;&#10;In UNDO: Forbidden Knowledge, tragedy strikes on a graveyard in a swamp, in 1923&rsquo;s City of Arkham: A man, standing by an open crypt, realizes the existence of something so terrifying that, in shock, he suffers an immediate cardiac arrest. Set in the mythical world of H.P. Lovecraft, players of this UNDO case are bound to cross paths with otherworldly horrors.&#10;&#10;A cemetery in the swamp, July 1923: A man is his twenties is standing next to an open crypt, a horrified expression on his face. Next to him are a backpack, a spade, and a portable telephone, the wire of which leads down the stairs into the darkness. &quot;Get out! Push back the grave slab and RUN!&quot; cries a panicked voice through the receiver. &quot;I can't leave you, Harley,&quot; the man answers in a trembling voice, &quot;Harley, can you hear me?&quot; A crackling noise from the receiver makes him pause &mdash; then a hollow, gelatinous, disembodied voice echoes through the receiver: &quot;YOU FOOL, HARLEY IS DEAD.&quot; The man begins laughing hysterically. To protect his sanity, his heart stops, and he drops dead...&#10;&#10;",

Players cards are rated for the player's abilities during that season.  You select running and passing plays and actually use the player stats.  For example you roll to see if Warren Moon completes a pass and then roll a die on Brian Kelly's card to see how many yards he gets.  Same with kickers and punters etc.  The game flow gives a very good simulation of a CFL game.&#10;&#10;",

If Time or your Stamina runs out, the heiress is murdered and you lose the game and the Case.&#10;&#10;Needed to Play: &#10;The deck of 36 cards&#10;4 YELLOW Investigate Dice&#10;1 RED Paperboy Die&#10;1 GRAY Underworld Connection Die&#10;8 wooden cubes&#10;&#10;Game Phases:&#10;1. Storyline - Move the cube on the Time card down one hour and draw the top 3 cards of the Investigate deck. Do not look at their front sides. Choose 1 and place it face up in front of you (this is the current Storyline card); a 2nd card is placed on the discard pile face down; the last card is randomly placed back in the draw deck. Each Investigate card will display a letter designating the type of card - I for Informants, C for Cliffhangers and F for Follow a Lead.&#10;&#10;2. Investigate - Check the time remaining in the game and locate the 3 numbered circles at the bottom left of the Storyline card. On the Storyline card, look at the circle in a row with a number closest to, but greater than, the hour marked currently on the Time card. This is the row of icons you must match by rolling your Investigate dice. You may only use the YELLOW Investigate dice to match the Storyline icons, unless you have certain Items that allow you to use the RED and GRAY dice, Twist icons, or your detective&rsquo;s Special Action.&#10;&#10;The Hunch - Roll each YELLOW Investigate die, one at a time, as dictated by your Stamina. You may also roll the RED and/or GRAY dice, if you have them. You may choose any of the dice to roll next and/or when to apply any rerolls. Each die shows four icons and each repeats two pairs of those icons, as designated by a *. Choosing which dice to roll and when depends on your detective instincts. Each die is different. If you need to roll a 5th or 6th YELLOW die, choose one of your current dice, noting its current face, and roll it again.&#10;&#10;You may subtract an hour of time if your Stamina level is at 1 or 2 to roll an additional YELLOW die. This die may be rolled during the Investigate phase and is lost once the phase has ended.&#10;&#10;You may use matching Twist icons, if you have them, in addition to the dice, by removing their marking cubes on the Criminal card.&#10;&#10;If you can match the Storyline icons, you gain the reward shown in the white area in that row. If you cannot match the icons, you must lose Stamina, Time or your currently held Item, as shown in the brown area in that row.&#10;&#10;If you have failed in your investigation, you may choose one icon from the YELLOW die faces shown and mark this in the Twist section on the Criminal card with a cube. You may save a maximum of 4 Twist icons in this manner.&#10;&#10;3. Confront the Criminal - When the 4th clue is found, draw the top card on the Investigate deck and match the die icon shown to those of the 4 criminals on the Criminal card to discover who you must confront to save the heiress. The row of icons shown for this Criminal must be matched by rolling Investigate dice as listed by your current Stamina. You may only use the icons on the YELLOW Investigate dice to match the Criminal icons, unless you have certain Items which allow you to roll the RED and GRAY dice, saved Twist icons, or your detective&rsquo;s Special Action. You may reroll a YELLOW Investigate die of your choice for every 2 hours of Time remaining in the game, rounding down. Match the icons, solve the Case, and win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Levitate has a creative mechanic for turn order so you don&rsquo;t always follow the same player and a wide variety of card effects and player goals so no game will be the same.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll learn from the three most powerful stage magicians of the 1800s. Howard Thurston, Harry Kellar, and Alexander Hermann. They will teach you stunning illusions using technology, sleight of hand, the use of accomplices, gadgets, and camouflage.  Gain points for these types of mechanics, but only the first player to choose those points receives them.&#10;&#10;Be the master of close-up magic, medium sized tricks, or dominate the stage with gigantic effects with elephants and carriages. When one teacher is out of dice, simply re-roll all dice and keep the magic going. Each effect learned reveals a new place to perform and an opportunity to gain acclaim, add flair, or gain points. Your road to the biggest cities must connect.  Then once the show is done, new illusions are placed on the board. As you add flair to each illusion, points are gained each time you show them.&#10;&#10;Some illusions will allow you to control the game, move your workers to new locations, manipulate dice present on the teachers, gain more acclaim, add new workers, duplicate other players&rsquo; cards, and learn certain types of effects instantly.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Race Pace is a strategic race board game where you play the Team Manager of a race team in the most exciting racing class.&#10;&#10;In the highest racing championship, the drivers stand in the spotlight. They have to be skilled, fearless and experienced. But racing is mostly a true team sport. Hundreds of engineers, designers and mechanics work together to find the optimal Race Pace. The person responsible to lead the team to victory is the Team Manager, and that is you!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;As the Team Manager of a race team, your goal is to make sure your driver is the first to cross the finish line! Before you start the game, you select a circuit and each player selects a team, a driver and a tyre compound to start on. Set up the board and turn the first weather card.&#10;&#10;The Race Pace (hereafter: RP) is the number of laps that your car can make in a game round. Your RP depends on a number of factors. But basically, the gameplay comes down to selecting an action in each game round and thereby gradually improving your RP (upgrade the car, coach the driver, charge or use the boost system, take defensive actions or make use of strategic opportunities). At the end of your turn, count the RP that your car can make and move your car across the track. But keep an eye on your tyre conditions and race situations that occur at the start of the game round, because they can limit your race pace.&#10;&#10;Each game round consist of 3 phases&#10;&#10;1. Turn the event cards&#10;2. Select an action&#10;3. Count your speed and move your car&#10;&#10;No race is the same&#10;Choose from 8 drivers with unique skills, 8 race teams with unique capabilities and 12 circuits with a different difficulty, tyre wear and weather conditions. Think about your tyre strategy: will you start on soft, medium or hard tyre compounds? Keep an eye on the weather forecast in order to change to Wets on time! During the race, situations will occur that can change the course of the game. From your radio control centre at the pit wall, you anticipate or react to these situations: select the right tyres, improve the car set up, coach the driver, order a pit stop, to use the Boost system, etcetera. With each lap your car and driver will improve, increasing the Race Pace. But so does the competition.&#10;&#10;Do you have the best strategy to win the race?&#10;&#10;Team Mode&#10;Race Pace has an alternative gameplay variant: the Team Mode. In Team Mode, each player manages one team with two drivers, or two players can team up with two different drivers for the same team! The gameplay changes in a way that you can now help each other (or your team mate). However, winning the game in Team Mode is also a team effort, so sacrificing one driver for the race win of the other is not sufficient. This gives the Team Mode a new dimension to the race strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Each card in Spot it! features eight different symbols, with the symbols varying in size from one card to the next; any two cards have exactly one symbol in common.

Whoever has collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins.&#10;&#10;To this basic game Spot it! Party adds eight colored card holders and (more importantly for gameplay) a &quot;hand mascot&quot; &ndash; a totem shaped like the eyeball-bearing hand in the game's logo. Six new mini-games &ndash; such as called &quot;The Race&quot;, &quot;Dynamite&quot;, and &quot;Double Frenzy&quot; &ndash; incorporate the card holders and hand mascot into the gameplay. In &quot;The Tower&quot;, for example, players still need to make matches, but they also need to keep an eye out for opportunities to steal or pass the hand mascot in order to have a chance to win.&#10;&#10;",

However, rats also roam the warehouse who see these spices as a tasty snack.

    "Description": "Okey is a traditional Turkish game, similar to Rummikub and Mahjong.&#10;&#10;Players manage their hand to make runs and sets. The first one to use all of their pieces wins the game.&#10;&#10;Suits come in 4 colors and run from 1 to 13. Notably, runs (of the same suit) can end with a 1 tile if they contain a 13 tile.&#10;&#10;The game needs paying careful attention on the opponent's discarded pieces and plan new series according to them, as there is only a pair of every piece.&#10;&#10;The game's namesake is the wild &quot;Okey&quot; tile, chosen randomly between the regular tiles at the start of every round.&#10;&#10;Depending on the last tile a player discards to win a round, they score different amounts of points- finishing by discarding a regular tile is worth 2 points, but discarding an Okey tile is worth 4 points. An &quot;indicator&quot; tile is used to determine the Okey every round, and if someone has the identical indicator tile in their starting hand, they score an extra point.&#10;&#10;Scoring is done in a unique manner- every point scored by a player is not added to their own total, but subtracted from every other player's score. The game ends when someone reaches 0 points or lower, and at that point the person with the highest remaining score wins. A usual game of Okey starts with 20 points per player.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "S.Y.N.C. is the cooperative game where players choose the character (phantom) cards that are best linked with the available sets of associations. The trick is that the players are not allowed to communicate with each other before they make up their choice and to win the round all of the players need to pick one and only one character from the available pool. The difficulty grows with each round as the pool of the characters to choose from is increasing.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to gather members of the space expedition among the phantoms of the past (historical personalities) and phantoms from the imaginary world (fictional characters). Players need to choose only one phantom card, that is best linked with the generated association key-cards. Each player makes the choice secretly, without discussion with the team. To win the round, all players must unanimously point at the same phantom. To win the game the players must win 5 rounds within maximum of 9 attempts.&#10;&#10;S.Y.N.C. legend&#10;S.Y.N.C. (Synchronizing Neuro-Connector) is a super-computer that allowed humanity to establish contacts with the new worlds using the power of synchronizing minds. It has become possible to teleport phantom messengers of the Earth from the past or from the mysterious dimension of fantasies to the distant corners of the Universe. The experiment requires a group of people who can use S.Y.N.C. technology to assemble an expedition of five phantoms and send them to discover new space horizons. But be careful as five unsuccessful sessions will reboot the system and you will have to start all over again. The key to the success of the mission is the unity of thoughts and feelings of the participants. Synchronize with each other and discover the power of the collective mind as you connect via S.Y.N.C.&#10;&#10;S.Y.N.C. DISCOVERY is the 1st game in the S.Y.N.C. family and very soon there will be new modules available including traitor expansion, campaign expansion, new phantom card sets and new assoication key-cards sets. Stay tuned :)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 7 Kingdoms, players are royal agents who want to collect as many followers as possible. Whoever does this best will win the game.&#10;&#10;The deck in 7 Kingdoms consists of 49 cards in seven types, with each type having seven cards in a particular number range: king (1-7), bishop (8-14), etc. up to peasant (43-49). Each number range has seven cards in it, with each being a different color and bearing a crest of that color. Each player starts with three cards in hand, and one crest card of each type is laid in a row, with one card placed face up next to each crest.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turn laying one card face up in front of them, then they resolve the cards from high to low. Whoever played the highest card places it on the opposite side of the leftmost crest card, then takes 1-4 cards from those on display next to the crests as determined by the power of the card played. Then the player with the next highest card goes, etc. Any cards unclaimed are placed to the right of played cards, then the row is filled with cards from the deck until seven cards are on display once again.&#10;&#10;With each card claimed, the player can either add it to his hand (up to a maximum of three cards in hand) or place it in his scoring pile. Kings, for example, let you take any four cards on display, while generals let you take cards from three consecutive spaces, princesses let you take any two cards, and peasants let you take one of two cards from specific spaces. Thus, the low cards let you claim first, but put more restrictions on what you claim or have you claim fewer cards. The bishop scores himself, then let you place one of two bonus tokens on the leftmost crest card, reveal another bonus token, then claim one card.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out or each crest card has a bonus token, the game ends and players score any cards remaining in hand. Each card claimed is worth 1 point (except for kings, which are worth 2), and whoever has the most cards of a crest claims the bonus token on that crest, thereby earning bonus points or doubling his score.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, players pull the top card from a deck to reveal the board's action as well as the options they may take. The top portion of the card typically advances the color of one of the robots towards the PJ Masks base - the bottom portion gives players two options. These options are either to move one of the PJ Masks a number of spaces to fend off the robots, or to deal a hit point to Romeo's lab. Players must strategize which PJ Mask to move and when. If any robot makes it to the base, Romeo wins and the players lose. Otherwise, if the players manage to get the Lab down to 0 energy, the players win.&#10;&#10;",

The Pagat database and newer research indicate that it was introduced in the 1920s or 1930s and is a version of the traditional card-games Three-spot and Troika, but was re-named with the influence of the card game Joffre that was originally called &quot;Shoo le Kaiser&quot;.&#10;&#10;Re-implementation of:&#10;&#10;     Joffre&#10;     Lost Heir&#10;&#10;&#10;(Kaiser has absolutely no connection with the ancient Swiss card game called Kaiserspiel or Kaiserjass.)&#10;&#10;",
