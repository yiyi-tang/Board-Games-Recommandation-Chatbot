Nothing else is needed to play!&#10;&#10;This volume comes with an updated and expanded rule book that adds additional detail specific to the navies included herein. Particularly the introduction of explosive shells, fired from the mighty Russian &quot;edinerogs&quot; (or &quot;unicorns&quot;).&#10;&#10;Included are a baker's dozen of battles pitting the Imperial Russian Navy against those of Sweden and Turkey. Each battle is fought by two players (or two teams of players) across one or several conjoined maps depicting shallows and shoals with individually named vessels that have been specifically rated for their abilities in combat.&#10;&#10;Players activate these ships through the command abilities of individually rated admirals present at each battle (including the mercenary adventurer and American naval icon: John Paul Jones). Players may also easily create their own scenarios with &quot;design your own&quot; rules and even pit these fleets against those from other volumes in the Flying Colors series.

Nevertheless, prohibition is going to represent a gold mine for smugglers who dare to challenge the authorities. From the hooligan to the respected politician, many people have tried their luck on this lucrative market, yet it remains a dangerous activity since the agents of the prohibition &mdash; the Prohis &mdash; roam around...&#10;&#10;In Prohis, each player embodies a smuggler who tries to make a fortune by transporting illegal goods &mdash; a highly precarious activity since the other players have the opportunity to check your cargo or even seize it if they find suspicious items.     &#10;         &#10;Each player starts with an Inspector, a Captain, and a hand of four cards, with the deck being comprised of legal goods, illegal goods, and Lieutenants. Four cards are placed face-up on the table. On a turn, a player either draws 1-2 cards from those on display or from the deck, or attempts to smuggle a convoy of 2-4 cards by placing them on the table face down. When smuggling, each other player gets the chance to throw a cargo controller at the smuggled goods, with the highest valued controller taking charge of the inspection. The cargo mover can try to bribe the controller to make this trouble go away, but if that doesn't work an Inspector, the highest rating, can look at three cargo cards, a Captain two, and a Lieutenant one. If the controller reveals an illegal good, the owner of that card gets to seize all of the cargo, placing it and her controller in her warehouse; if all the goods are legal, the shipper claims the cargo in the warehouse and the controller in hand. If a controller awaits among the cargo, then this informant has been revealed and the inspection fails.     &#10;         &#10;When the deck runs out or players all pass on drawing cards, the game ends, with players scoring $4k for each illegal good in the warehouse, $1k for each legal good, and $1-5k for controllers in hand and in the warehouse. Illegal goods in hand cost money, and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After tackling the Russian Front with the first game of the No Retreat! Series, wargamer and designer Carl Paradis revisits this fascinating campaign with: &quot;Absolute War! - The Russian Front 1941-45&quot;. This two-player wargame recreates the titanic struggle between the invading armies of Nazi Germany versus the Soviet Union in a fresh new way.&#10;&#10;The design emphasis has been placed on making the game very player-friendly and manageable in its level of scope, difficulty and time of play. With a very low total counter count and density, this quick playing (while still realistic) simulation presents players with deep strategy meriting contemplation. A system of map areas has been adopted and movement has been streamlined. Combat is handled by the two decks of cards (one German and one Soviet) - meaning no combat tables or dice to roll. These cards are the crux of the game system offering even more variety than regular Combat Result Tables. Like in &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo; they are used to generate events and special game abilities (ex: Major Offensives, Partisan Raids, Siege Artillery, Increased Replacements, etc&hellip;) and now also effortlessly resolve all battle outcomes. The set-up for a campaign or a scenario will be lightning fast: in less than 10-15 minutes you can get the game going! This high degree of re-playability means that it will reward players' experience with increased skill.&#10;&#10;&quot;Absolute War! The Russian Front 1941-45&quot; will put emphasis on strategic planning - not tedious hex maneuvering or factor-counting to attain the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; attack. Most of the time-consuming calculations will be taken care of effortlessly by the game engine, letting you concentrate instead on exercising your generalship skills against your opponent. Area-movement will provide the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia. The grueling city sieges will be represented by allowing local battles to unfold, with sometimes both foes occupying and battling in the same critical map areas. With a simple &ndash; yet effective - economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Soviet Red Army and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht over the epic four years that this merciless campaign was fought on the soil of &ldquo;Mother Russia&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Victory conditions are simple and to the point: you have to capture as many of the ten map objectives to force a campaign decision. While destroying the foe&rsquo;s armies will also help in this endeavor, some event cards will also provide short-term goals to accomplish - gaining players&rsquo; special game advantages if met.&#10;&#10;Neither side can afford to show mercy to their hated foe in this life-or-death conflict, you are in command in the largest and most grueling campaign the world has ever seen. War is hell, and this is Absolute War!&#10; Four Quick-Playing Scenarios plus a Campaign Game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Barbarossa, 1941 : The initial assault on the Soviet Union. Can the Germans take Leningrad and Moscow before &ldquo;General Winter&rdquo; freezes the German war machine dead in its tracks?&#10;     Fall Blau &amp; Operation Saturn, 1942 : The Offensive towards the Caucasus Oil Fields, and the Nazis disastrous rendezvous with destiny at Stalingrad . Or&hellip;maybe the OKH will decided to strike north again at the Soviet Capital?&#10;     Operation Zitadelle, 1943: Hitler&rsquo;s last chance at getting a &ldquo;victory&rdquo; of sorts in the East after last winter disaster in the south. It&rsquo;s a do-or-die proposition for the Germans, as the Red Army can finally fight on equal terms. Will Kursk be the tombstone of the Panzers?&#10;     Operation Bagration, 1944:  The Soviet summer offensive that finally broke the back of the Wehrmacht, and made the Normandy landings look like a mere scuffle. Will you finally expel the hated foe enemies from their last foothold in Mother Russia?&#10;&#10;&#10;Absolute War Campaign game: From Operation Barbarossa in 1941 to the aftermath of Bagration in 1944. The whole conflict up to the gates of Germany is played out in dramatic fashion.&#10; Playing time:  Approximately 3 - 4 hours for a full campaign game, 1- 2 hours for the Shorter Scenarios.&#10; Scale: Each unit is one Army/Front: Each area is about 200 kilometers from side to side. Each turn represents two months of real time.&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website)&#10;&#10;",

If you banish the Elder God before he reduces all of the Investigators health to zero you win the game.&#10;&#10;There are two phases of the game, a planning and combat phase.&#10;&#10;1) In the planning phase, the Investigators activate cards in their hand, research new cards at the Miskatonic University and then ready themselves for final preparation.&#10;&#10;2) In the combat phase, the Elder God and his minions attack the Investigators' health and sanity. Investigators may go crazy or die out right, however, they have a chance to fight back. The Investigators use Moxie to push back the waves of the occult and supernatural.&#10;&#10;Building your personal library by researching in the Miskatonic University makes you stronger and is your only hope against the Elders.

    "Description": "In this classic Italian word game, players use their eight drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;Aldo Pasetti self-produced the game and was sued by the publisher of Scrabble, that has very, very similar board, tiles and rules. The trial took place in the late '50s and ended with a verdict of acquittal on the basis that game mechanics are not relevant and no confusion can be made between a long name as &quot;Scarabeo&quot; and a short one as &quot;Scrabble&quot;, so it is not even unfair competition. Editrice Giochi had waited for the definitive acquittal: after that, it published the game.&#10;&#10;",

Your empire represents the earlier Hopewell culture and the later Mississippian culture that derived from it.&#10;&#10;Until the arrival of the Spanish late in the game, you will expand your control across the map of North America, extending it over the various chiefdoms encountered and incorporating them into your economic and religious sphere (&ldquo;empire&rdquo;). Your domain will grow and shrink, but be aware that rather than a military advance and retreat, this process represents the rise and decline of culture, religious ideology, and an economic way of life, threatened from outside by competing ideologies and lifestyles as much as by hostile armies.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to extend Mound Builder culture and amass as many chiefdoms as possible before rival native powers (and the smallpox-ridden Spanish!) rise up to drive you back to your Mississippi River heartland and extinguish your vast capital city at Cahokia, Illinois &ndash; near modern St. Louis.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dungeon Saga Origins is a thrilling board game of classic fantasy adventure, fast-paced action, and beautiful miniatures.&#10;Set in the dungeons of the fantasy world of Pannithor, players have a number of quests with different win conditions, all connected to the game&rsquo;s story.&#10;&#10;This game has been designed with a wide audience in mind. The rules are intuitive enough for family gaming (from 10 years and up), but also support clever synergies by experienced players. Suggested difficulty modifiers are also included for those wanting a high level of challenge. While very playable and accessible, success will come from good decisions and teamwork, rather than just through good luck.&#10;There are two ways to play the game:&#10;&#10;1. With a traditional human Overlord, who controls the dungeon, traps and enemies. They can decide whether they want to run a game that is more challenging, or more casual, depending on the player group.&#10;&#10;2. With an Overlord controlled by the game rules, and all the heroes controlled by human players.&#10;Mission setup is very fast due to pre-assembled miniatures and large numbered dungeon tiles. Variety comes from changing the numbered tiles, their side/orientation, door placement and furniture placement. The tiles have a square grid to simplify measuring distances, defining line of sight, and item positioning.&#10;&#10;The game is played in Rounds. In each Round, all the Hero players will each take a Turn with a single Hero, and then the Overlord player will take their Turn.&#10;When a player takes a Turn with a Hero, they may both Move and take an Action (act) with their Hero.&#10;Aside from movement, players can take the below actions:&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&bull; Fight&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&bull; Shoot&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&bull; Cast Spell&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&bull; Use a Feat&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&bull; Explore &#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&bull; Revive &#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&bull; Trade&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Some actions are resolved automatically, and others use dice rolls. Combat actions use opposed dice rolls and a dice matching mechanic.&#10;Exploration is a key theme in the game, and the heroes may discover loot (including legendary items), find secret passages or activate deadly traps. Exploration is driven by a shuffled card deck, which creates unpredictability on repeat play-throughs.&#10;&#10;There are post-game sequences for campaigns. Hero players are free to trade items, equipment and even gold between games if they wish as they prepare for their next adventure.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sheepshead is a trick-taking card game related to the Skat family of games. It is the Americanized version of a card game that originated in Central Europe in the late 18th century under the German name Schafkopf.&#10;&#10;Sheepshead is played with 7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in four suits, for a total of 32 cards. A sheepshead deck is made by removing all of the jokers, sixes, fives, fours, threes, and twos from a standard deck.&#10;&#10;Card strength:&#10;Card strength in sheepshead is different than in most other games. It is one of the most difficult things for some beginners to grasp.&#10;&#10;There are 14 cards in the trump suit: all four queens, all four jacks, and all of the diamonds. In order of strength from greatest to least:&#10;&#10;Q&clubs; Q&spades; Q&hearts; Q&diams;&#10;J&clubs; J&spades; J&hearts; J&diams;&#10;A&diams; 10&diams; K&diams; 9&diams; 8&diams; 7&diams;&#10;Also, there are 6 of each &quot;fail&quot; suit (18 total).&#10;A, 10, K, 9, 8, and 7 of &clubs;, &spades;, and &hearts;&#10;&#10;Clubs, spades, and hearts take no precedence over other fail suits, unlike trump, which always take fail. (Notice how both aces and tens outrank kings; arguably the most confusing aspect of card strength). The lead suit must be followed if possible; if not, then any card may be played such as trump (which will take the trick), or a fail card. Playing a fail of a different suit is called &quot;throwing off&quot; and can be a way to clear up another suit. Additionally, throwing off a point card is called &quot;schmearing&quot;.&#10;&#10;Card point values:&#10;Each card is given a separate point value as follows:&#10;Ace &mdash; 11 points&#10;Ten &mdash; 10 points&#10;King &mdash; 4 points&#10;Queen &mdash; 3 points&#10;Jack &mdash; 2 points&#10;9, 8, 7 &mdash; 0 points&#10;&#10;The strongest cards (queens and jacks) are not worth the most points, giving Sheepshead some of its unusual character.&#10;There are 120 points total in the deck. The goal of the game is to get half of these (60 or 61); in case of a tie, the player who picked up the blind loses, and that player's opponents win. (There are variant rules for more peculiar situations, such as the Leaster.)&#10;&#10;This is one of the few traditional card games with a hidden partner.&#10;&#10;Jack of Diamonds is a random partner method where the picker receives a partner without needing to call or lead a suit. The picker can still choose to &quot;go it alone&quot;, but needs to declare before the hand begins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ScandalOh! is a &quot;Brilliant Deck System&quot; deduction game about investigative journalism in which each playing presents a different scenario, and players have to bring a scandal to light.&#10;&#10;WHAT is the scandal plot?&#10;WHICH celebrity is behind it?&#10;WHICH newspaper will make it public?&#10;&#10;The game challenges you to use genuine investigative abilities to solve each case. To get the scoop, you have to keep an eye on the celebrities and their contacts, question the newspaper editors, search for clues anywhere in the city, and consult your sources. You do all of this while exchanging information with your opponents or hiding it from them, so get ready to use all your deductive skills!&#10;&#10;The heart of ScandalOh! is simple: Players have a hand of seven cards, and each card has a value (1 or 2 points, according to the amount of information that it provides) and several references (i.e., the subjects of the card information). During a turn, you ask for information about three different references in which you are interested. The rest of the players can offer you cards that contain the requested references, and you can trade for those cards by giving the offering players the same number of points they have offered via cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;After each round ends, players can try to uncover the scandal. If the actual scandal is not revealed, players discard part of their hands and receive three new cards. The player or players who uncover the scandal first win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bag of Dungeon is a dungeon crawling tile-based game harking back to the good old deadly days of exploring dungeons, slaying monsters and stealing treasure. It's a simple-to-play tabletop game where 1-4 players send a party of adventurers into the ever-changing catacombs in a quest to find the Ring of Creation before escaping with their lives and their loot.&#10;&#10;But can you trust your fellow adventurers? To begin with, you are all loyal to the quest and each other. But once the Ring is discovered it will cast a shadow of doubt and deceit over those who seek to steal it. You may decide that being a lone wolf is a far smarter choice than loyalty, even if it means the death of your former companions.&#10;&#10;You will meet monsters, find treasure and use items to stay alive and escape with the Ring before the dungeon seals itself shut, imprisoning for all eternity anyone who remains.&#10;&#10;The game has a simple but clever mechanic; great for young and/or new gamers to learn fast and take part while still giving more experienced gamers a satisfying time at the table. The game takes 20-60 minutes and changes every time you play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Mirroring of Mary King is a two-player game in which one person is a mortal contemporary woman named Mary King and the other player is the ghost of Mary&rsquo;s long dead ancestor, a 17th century Scottish merchant burgess of the same name. While on a week&rsquo;s holiday in Edinburgh, Mary visits Mary King&rsquo;s Close where her presence attracts the spirit of her long dead ancestor, now a hungry ghost that wants to live again in Mary&rsquo;s body. The two Marys engage in a battle for control of the living Mary&rsquo;s mortal body.&#10;&#10;Players use control cards and power cards to exert their influence on Mary King&rsquo;s psyche, represented by 12 tiles arranged in a 4 x 3 grid. These tiles are flipped back and forth throughout the game as the players gain and lose control of them.&#10;&#10;The game progresses over five days, starting on Monday and ending on Friday. Each player gets one turn each day, with the ghost player always going first. As the week progresses, the mortal and the ghost become more exhausted and more desperate: the number of control cards each may play decreases and the number of ideas they may pursue increases. At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn, both players suffer penalties based on the tiles of Mary that their opponent controls.&#10;&#10;A player may immediately win the game by completing their image of Mary using the 12 tiles, or if their opponent runs out of cards. If neither player completes their image of Mary by the end of Friday, the winner is determined by a scoring system based on their remaining cards and their control of Mary.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Explore the depths and try to bring the most precious items to the surface. Mark your presence in the different areas to control them and claim their riches.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the six dice up to three times, keeping and re-rolling dice as you wish, to simulate a dive. Dice show the numbers 1-5 and a treasure chest, and when you stop rolling, you place shells on one of the levels that you reached. If, for example, you rolled 1-1-2-3-5-5, you place two shells on level 1, one shell on level 2, or one shell on level 3. You can't place shells on level 5 because you didn't dive through level 4 to get there. If you roll a perfect sequence of 1-2-3-4-5-chest, then you grab one of the five random treasure chests, which are worth 5-8 points, then take another turn. If you don't roll a 1, then you don't place any shells at all!&#10;&#10;When the fifth chest has been claimed, the game ends immediately. Alternatively, when someone places their last shell, each other player takes one final turn. On each of the five levels, whoever has placed the most shells scores the main treasure token for that level; whoever has the secondmost shells takes the secondary treasure token, and in a game with 4-5 players, the player with the thirdmost shells also scores. Ties are broken in favor of whoever has the most shells on the level immediately above the one being evaluated. Players sum their points from tokens and chest, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

For the battles in Gringo!, both sides run the gamut from mountain assaults to street-fighting, allowing wargamers to see some of the differences between ACW-era tactics and those of the Napoleonic era. The battles included are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Buena Vista, the classic battle of the war, with Zach Taylor's decimated army making a valiant stand against Santa Anna and a force three times Taylor's. &#10;    Monterey, with the North Americans launching a three-pronged assault against, into, and through the beautiful city of Monterey, complete with huge fortifications, high peaks, bull rings, cathedrals filled with ammunition, even a telegraph system. &#10;    Cerro Gordo, Scott's first meeting with Santa Anna, on the dangerous mountain roads leading towards the heart of Mexico. &#10;    El Molino del Rey, where Santa Anna makes a last, well-entrenched stand outside Mexico City. Will that Mexican cavalry division ever move? &#10;    Chapultepec, a mini-battle, in which the gringos have to scale the precipitous heights of this immense fortress guarding the roads into the Mexican capital. &quot;Stonewall&quot; (pre-nickname) Jackson, hidden mines, wall-scaling, and those courageous Mexican pre-teen cadets. &#10;&#10;&#10;The wargame rules are simplier (GBACW v4.3) with reduced command rules (for the smaller armies); they also include extensive rules for street-fighting and the square formation. The game includes some of the most colorful characters in military history: General Zachary Taylor &amp; inept division leaders Twiggs &amp; Pillow for the Americans; head throwing General Pedro Ampudia and Generalissimo Antonio de Santa Anna.&#10;&#10;Gringo! is easily the most playable, colorful and challenging of the GBACW series wargames to date. 2 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps (1-backprinted), 4 countersheets, plus the usual rules and charts.&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 60 minutes per game turn&#10;Map Scale: between 45-125 yards per hex&#10;Unit Scale: Each Strength Point = 50 men&#10;Players: 1-6&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Battle of Churubusco&#10;    Battles with the Gringos, Mexico 1846-62&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This was followed in 1990 with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; version, which replaced the original release.  &quot;Deluxe&quot; was indicated on the front of the box to indicate it was the new version.  The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Deluxe&quot; version had three expansions:&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Carrier War&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault&#10;&#10;&#10;In 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the F&amp;E 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade.&#10;&#10;In 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Advanced Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Combined Operations (combined and replaced Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations and Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Fighter Operations (replaced Federation & Empire: Carrier War)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Planetary Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Strategic Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: ISC War&#10;    Federation & Empire: Minor Empires&#10;&#10;&#10;Since 2010 ADB has created, in both print and pdf form, Compendium I, II and III.

    "Description": "Templar: The Secret Treasures is an exciting family game in which the players help the Knights Templar to get their treasures to a secret abbey and hide them inside. Each player can use the different members of the abbey to help them hide the treasures &ndash; but every character is different and needs to be used wisely. Whoever hides the most treasures wins!&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of ten character cards and a starting supply of treasure: one book, one chalice, and a handful of signet rings that come in three types. A harbor with six storehouses is stocked with additional treasures, and three characters &ndash; Abbot Remigius, Vitus, and Prior Severus &ndash; are placed in the 13-room abbey.&#10;&#10;For the first round of the game, each player secretly chooses a character card, then they all reveal them simultaneously, with players then carrying out the actions on those cards in player order. Some characters represent monks who help you move through the abbey and hide treasure, others allow you to take treasure from the harbor, open a locked door while closing off another passage, or move treasure that another player has already stashed, among other things. When a player moves Abbot Remigius, the Abbot rewards all players who have stashed treasure in the room in which he ends his movement, with all of the treasure then being marked as scored &ndash; other than duplicate signet rings, which can score again should the Abbot return. (Vitus, who isn't controlled by a card, follows the Abbot closely to spy upon him, thus keeping the Abbot from returning to the most recent room he entered.) If the Prior Severus is in a room, though, the Abbot can't do his thing as Severus would then discover the treasure and learn of the Knights' actions.&#10;&#10;After the initial round, a player must play a character card that doesn't match the top character card on any player's discard pile &ndash; which means that you (and others) play both offense and defense with the same character card, restricting the action of others while ideally making good use of the character yourself. When a player lays down The Bells card, he picks up all of his played cards, then restocks the harbor based on the number of his previously played character card.&#10;&#10;When the harbor can no longer be filled properly or when a player has placed at least one treasure in each room, the final round is triggered, then players have a final scoring for their rings still in the abbey and for the number of rooms that hold their treasure. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "GMT is proud to present Vance von Borries&rsquo; sixth epic game in his award winning series of East Front games, Barbarossa: Crimea. This is a two-player operational level game depicting the battles in the Crimean peninsula of the Soviet Union during 1941 and 1942. Beginning in mid-October 1941 and ending in January 1942, it completes the year 1941 in this series of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. And it includes 1942 scenarios of the continued fighting in Crimea until the historical fall of the great Soviet naval fortress Sevastopol in July 1942.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;One 22x34 inch map&#10;840 counters&#10;Rule booklet in color&#10;Playbook in color&#10;Various player aid cards for charts and tables in color&#10;Set up cards for each scenario in color&#10;4 Scenario cards 11x17&#10;1 ten sided die&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, waffen SS, NKVD, militia, base units, naval units, and more. You have reinforcement options to tailor your army to fight a full campaign with many historical variables.&#10;&#10;As we have indicated with each game, all games in this series share the same game mechanics. Veteran East Front Series (EFS) players will find much here that is familiar. Such mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away, and for them we have clarified many game procedures. For those who are new to the series, examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.&#10;&#10;All games of the EFS series are built to fit together side-by-side for possible combined play. We recognize that space is at a premium for some of you, so consider that all of the eight scenarios in this game require only one map or less; yes, just one map! Newcomers should try this game as a sample of the whole series.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Crimea includes several special features not found with all EFS games. Since the game revolves around Sevastopol, we include a special inset map to depict in detail the fighting at that important naval fortress. Much gaming will directly involve the inset, so we have streamlined previous series rules dealing with an inset map. We have also streamlined the naval rules, effectively rebuilding them. This in turn allowed us to rebuild the Odessa scenario found with the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series. There, and later in Crimea, the Soviets used amphibious operations to move battle lines forward. If an amphibious operation is not going well, the Soviets could declare an Evacuation. At Sevastopol the German player will be using his super-heavy artillery, including the world&rsquo;s largest artillery piece, Dora, historically seen in the final game scenario. The design notes include an essay on these wonder-weapons.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Crimea challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?&#10;&#10;THE SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;1) Learning Scenario: The Tartar Ditch. The German 11th Army has just received orders to enter the Crimea but to do so it must first clear the narrow Perekop Isthmus. This was the first battle for the Crimea. This is a small scenario but it teaches important lessons in precise game unit positioning - exactly what one would expect for historical positional warfare.&#10;&#10;2) Odessa: Hero City. This is a bloody example of siege warfare. The Romanian army shows exactly why it was so ill-suited for such an offensive, while the Soviets struggle to balance their forces from sector-to-sector and endure delays of reinforcements coming by sea. This rebuilds the scenario found in theArmy Group South game using new research and this game&rsquo;s improved naval rules.&#10;&#10;3) Crimea: The Road to Sevastopol. This begins in mid October 1941. The Germans almost certainly will break through the main Soviet defense line, so the Soviet player has to know when to break away from the action and run back to fresh prepared positions, a tactic typical of game play in other series games. The German player also chooses secret victory conditions. He will either drive south to Sevastopol or southeast to Kerch, forcing the Soviet to balance his defense of both.&#10;&#10;4) Sevastopol: The First Battle. With the Germans committed to Sevastopol, can the Soviet divert enough German attention elsewhere to save the fortress? In the meantime, the deeper the German pushes into the Sevastopol inset map, the better his chances for long-term victory.&#10;&#10;5) Crimean Campaign. The campaign scenario puts scenarios 3 and 4 together to feature a punch and counter-punch game strategy. The Soviet player relies on his naval units to rapidly shift the threat. The German relies on his infantry to consolidate gains.&#10;&#10;6) Kerch: The Party Boss Attack. Ever wonder why Mandated Attacks exist in this game system? In the middle of winter 1942 one of Stalin&rsquo;s cronies thought the armies holding the Kerch Peninsula in the Crimea were not sufficiently motivated to defeat the fascists. He personally bullied the local Front commander into do-or-die attacks. This scenario exemplifies the insanity of political expectations trumping battlefield realities. Can you find a weakness in the Axis line?&#10;&#10;7) Kerch: Operation Trappenjagd. Now it is the German turn to attack in the Kerch Peninsula but their champion knows how to attack. This is a brilliantly planned German attack, one that pays handsome dividends. Can you repeat Manstein&rsquo;s success? As the Soviet can you defeat Manstein&rsquo;s attack?&#10;&#10;8) Sevastopol: Operation Storfang. This is the last picture show in the Crimea and it will be bloody. Truly, the best is saved for the last as the Soviets fight for every last hill, fort, and farmhouse. They went down fighting and their sacrifice earned them great honor in the history books. It was close. The German plan of offensive was sound and it met each challenge the Soviets posed. Can you duplicate Manstein&rsquo;s cold calculations and earn your marshal&rsquo;s baton?&#10;&#10;",

This time, there is no board on which to place little figures: Every player has his own score card called the building sheet, which depicts a mini Catan (compare with Die Siedler von Catan: Paper &amp; Pencil). You build by drawing the settlements and roads on your score card.&#10;&#10;To build you still require resources. These are collected by a Yahtzee-like mechanism that involves throwing six special dice (depicting the different resource symbols) up to three times. After each roll, the player can select which dice to keep and which to roll again. In the end, he may build using the thusly determined resources, and is awarded victory points for any finished buildings, which are recorded on the score card.&#10;&#10;The game lasts fifteen turns or about 15-30 minutes, after which the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Note that the game has been designed for 1-4 players, meaning there is a solitaire version of the game, as well.&#10;&#10;Recent versions include double-sided map sheets and instructions for Catan Dice Game Plus.&#10;&#10;",

Each number in a grid that's adjacent to the same number is removed, and the sum of the remaining cards is your score. Whoever has the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, play multiple rounds until a player reaches 100 points, then once again whoever has the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kutuzov is an interactive, play it complete in one-sitting card-driven game of sweeping manoeuvres, epic battles, storied sieges, lethal attrition and crucial-to-win troop morale for one to four players from the designer of The Napoleonic Wars and Wellington.&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1812 Emperor Napoleon of France gathered the regiments of 20 nations together into the largest military force yet raised in Europe. That June he led this Grand Army of over 600,000 men across the Nieman River to begin what he believed would be his greatest and perhaps final triumph: the invasion and subjugation of Russia. As the defending armies fell back before this prodigious onslaught, Tsar Alexander turned to a pugnacious and crafty old warrior to help save his country, his people and his Romanov Dynasty: Marshal Mikhail KUTUZOV.&#10;&#10;Kutuzov uses the same basic rules system as found in The Napoleonic Wars, as it has been modified for even more interactive play in Wellington . As with the later title, there are no diplomatic or political rules: other than those which come into play should Imperial morale fall so low as to trigger the desertion of the Austrians or outright revolt of the Prussians. There are no naval rules other than a Russian ability to move between friendly ports and a &quot;Hornblower&quot; Home Card that allows for a Russian invasion on the Baltic Coast). Kutuzov is thus primarily a game of manoeuvre and combat, where players can recreate the sieges and legendary battles made so familiar to gamers as brought to life in such great books as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.&#10;&#10;As this is Russia, however, not all enemies stand in solid ranks before you. Players must contend not only with their opponents but with Cossack raiders, Polish Lancers, often brutally horrifying attrition, fragile morale, treacherous allies, political events from outside the theatre of war and, of course, &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; and &quot;General Winter&quot; himself, whose scourge effects both invader and defender of Holy Mother Russia.&#10;&#10;110 Cards, most with quotes from the actual participants in that great struggle, drive the game and bring to it the flavour of being in Russia during the 1812 Campaign. The Imperials and Tsarists each have mini- &quot;Home Decks&quot; of a dozen cards each to share, thus increasing the chance that events, forces and options that were presented to the original contenders will arise during play. The other 86 cards, which include many &quot;Must Play&quot; political events, however, ensure every playing of the game will be very different.&#10;&#10;Kutuzov comes with a campaign game that can last one, two, three or four turns - but which includes numerous mechanisms that can bring the game to a &quot;Sudden Death&quot; ending at the conclusion of or even DURING A TURN.&#10;&#10;Mark and Fred, in seeking to deliver more value, variation and enjoyable gaming have provided two other game start scenarios which allow for the game to begin at the commencement of what would be turn two (On to Smolensk!) or turn three (Napoleon in Moscow) of the campaign. A fourth and rather unique method of play allows for two players to each take ONE of the powers from EACH side, in a highly competitive and unusual game of labyrinthine think and double-think. A fifth version allows for two players to play the game using a SINGLE hand of cards each, with &quot;chips&quot; to buy additional cards for their side as the play progresses.&#10;&#10;The Campaign and the Scenarios:&#10;&#10;&quot;Invasion&quot;: A Turn One game start should see the French and their Allies' military juggernaut smash across the border and attempt to catch and annihilate the Russians before they can mass to defend their Motherland Can the players surpass their historical counterparts?&#10;&#10;&quot;On to Smolensk !&quot;: This permits players to avoid the border battles and initial French advances to begin play at a watershed of the Campaign: The Grand Army confronting concentrated Russian forces defending Smolensk immediately before Kutuzov arrives to take command. Will the French advance on Moscow as they did historically or seek victory through an alternative offensive direction&hellip;north to St. Petersberg or south to seize the Ukraine and other southern victory points?&#10;&#10;&quot;Napoleon in Moscow&quot;: In this version of Kutuzov the bloody Battle of Borodino has been fought. The Grand Army reposes in Moscow awaiting Russian surrender or at least agreement to terms. The first chill snow of Winter has fallen, harbinger what's to come: should the French remain deep in Russia hoping to conquer the country or is it time to withdraw to better defences for the 1813 Campaign?&#10;&#10;In all of the scenarios, the Imperial Powers have an initial advantage in numbers, leadership, Resources, and Morale. They are, after all, an Army that has never known defeat; a superb military instrument, led by the most powerful man in Europe with his devoted retinue of almost legendary Marshals. They face an enemy who has not tasted victory in Battle in nearly a generation, let alone full-scale war of the likes of which Napoleon wages. &#10;The French must take advantage of their superiority quickly, as that will soon dissipate in the immense marshes, unending steppes and fiercely fought over fields and cities of Russia. If they do not or can not succeed, then the advantage slips away to the forces of the Tsar, who, under Kutuzov, will not just be defending Russia, but will be advancing into the outer marches of that yet fragile empire led by their archenemy&hellip; Napoleon.&#10;&#10;",

With one map and a limited number of counters it's an excellent introduction to the series.&#10;&#10;August 29, 1756: The Seven Years War erupts in Europe. The Prussian army led by King Frederick II (later &quot;the Great&quot; to his admirers) invades Saxony. &quot;Blitzing&quot; through the neutral Saxon electorate he hopes to open a path to Austria&rsquo;s rich Elbe River valley in Bohemia. The Saxon army does not directly resist the invaders but withdraws into a fortified encampment on the Elbe River around Pirna, there awaiting rescue by the Austrians. The Prussian invasion grinds to a halt here; Frederick has no choice but to lay siege. Meanwhile in northern Bohemia, the Austrian army under Field Marshal Browne gathers its strength in preparation for the relief of its new ally.&#10;&#10;Retaining the initiative King Frederick split his army, leaving half to keep the Saxons penned in Pirna, while he marches with the rest into Bohemia in search of the Austrians. On the morning of October 1, they stumble onto Browne&rsquo;s army deployed around the little town of Lobositz on the Elbe River. A close fought, ten hour struggle ensues, with charge and counter-charges made across fog masked fields, hills and vineyards before culminating in a street fight amidst burning buildings. Finally, at darkness, the Austrians withdraw in good order, conceding the field.&#10;&#10;Although a small battle by Seven Years War standards, the action at Lobositz was significant for having delayed the Austrian relief effort enough to force the Saxon surrender at Pirna. Of greater significance, the Prussians learned that their enemy &ldquo;was no longer the same old Austrians&rdquo; they had previously faced, and a quick victory could not be expected. Lobositz would be the first of many battles in a war to last seven bloody years.&#10;&#10;(source: the Clash of arms Website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

When everybody is ready, players start looking for the hidden picture on their board with their &quot;magic&quot; flashlight, which can illuminate the board thanks to its white spot.&#10;&#10;When the sand timer runs out, players must stop searching, put down their flashlights, and set their dial on the number of hidden picture they think they have found. Then, they reveal the back side of the hidden picture card, which shows how many it was actually possible to find. The more you found, the more your pawn advances on the track...but beware, the Moon pawn will advance, too!&#10;&#10;If the Moon overtakes any player's pawn, you can spend a rush token to get them back in front of the Moon, but if you lack rush tokens, the game is over and you all lose!

    "Description": "Broadsides and Boarding Parties was the first title in Milton Bradley&#039;s Gamemaster series of games.  It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.&#10;&#10;The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.&#10;&#10;The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.  There are no elaborate plastic ships, cannons or playing pieces in the original edition, though.  You get paper maps and cardboard counters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1826 is an 18xx game set in France and Belgium and reflects the full period of Franco-Belgian railroading, from the origins to the present day. Both countries developed their railroad systems under close Government supervision and this is reflected in the game. The two major French nationalizations are covered, as are the post-war electrification and the introduction of high-speed rail (the TGV).&#10;&#10;1826 is a moderately complex game, designed for experienced players who are looking for something different than the usual round of 1830, 1856 and 1870. Due to the nature of the French political environment, this is not a game for extensive stock market manipulations, nor is it primarily a game of financial management. 1826 is an operationally-centered game in which technology management--getting the right trains on the right companies--is key.&#10;&#10;Companies are incrementally funded, and can buy and sell their own stock. Companies start out as five-share companies and can convert to ten-share companies upon reaching their destination. The first four train classes, including the first-generation permanent trains, have a range in hexes (2, 4, 6 or 10) rather than cities: the last two train classes, which are permanent, have a range in cities. There are two merger corporations, one of which may form relatively early (when the green tiles become available) and the other somewhat later (its first opportunity to form is when brown tiles become available).&#10;&#10;",

The Ice Coast will freeze early and will make the journey for supplies even more dangerous than usual.&#10;&#10;The riders bond together and journey as a group one final time from port to port. Many supplies are needed for their clans, and the riders agree to band together and commit to sharing one big consignment in each port.&#10;&#10;Soon, however, it becomes apparent that the raiders&rsquo; preferences for the offered consignments differ greatly. In each port, the to-ing and fro-ing begins anew to close the most preferred deal&hellip;&#10;&#10;In Whale Riders: The Card Game, a reimplementation of Reiner Knizia's classic card game Trendy, you ride alongside others to buy goods along the Ice Coast, sometimes working together with others only to become competitors again when a better proposition comes along.&#10;&#10;",

As the active player, you play one of your production tiles to take a number of dice from the junkyard; all other players then take one die each. All players simultaneously use their dice to complete robots or level up their factory.&#10;&#10;Players can also use spark to activate the abilities of their completed robots, or use cogs to recruit their animal assistants. You start the game with six assistants, each with a unique ability, and you should shape your strategy around them. The variety of assistants ensures that each game provides a different challenge. In the advanced game, players draft the assistants, providing more strategic options.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player is building a time line of cards. A card contains an event and the year in which it occurred. Players start with just one card, which are then placed face up under their &quot;Time lock.&quot; On his/her turn, a player rolls the dice to see which category he will have and then is read an event from the next card. The player must then indicate the position on his own time line where the card should be placed. If he's correct he takes possession of the card and places it above his Time lock (timeline) and he may stop or continue trying another card. If at any time a player does not correctly insert the card into the right place on their Time line, they lose all the cards they have accumulated this turn in order to keep cards permanently, players must end their turn with a correct answer.  First player with 10 cards in the correct order in their Time line wins.&#10;&#10;",

I can use an Inspector, Arrest or Alibi card on my opponents and so on. Play ends either when an Arrest successfully reveals a Villain, or when a player discards their last card, a Villain, who Escapes. Scoring is based on cards remaining in your hand, and if you are the arresting or guilty player, caught with a Villain in your hand.&#10;&#10; Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    I Say, Holmes!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A long time ago, the gods decided to pass Earth down to Mankind and retreated to live in the Heavens. They erected the Cloud Temple, a symbolic border between the two worlds and home to the Stone of Balance.&#10;As the sun shone from the Heavens and the Earth blossomed, the gods decided to open the gates of the Temple to only the most skilled people, allowing them to compete to become Kumo Hogosha, Guardians of the Clouds.&#10;Throughout the centuries, valiant warriors &ndash; the Kumotori &ndash; fought against each other in the Rotating Arena of the Four Winds where the renowned Stone of Balance resides. &#10;Each year, a prestigious tournament is held in which a single winner is elevated to the rank of Kumo Hogosha, a demigod amongst men. &#10;The challengers for this title compete in a duel that combines strength and strategy to demonstrate their skill in a myriad of fighting techniques.&#10;&#10;Today it is your turn to continue writing the legend and face these legendary warriors. Climb into the Arena, master its ever-changing environment, and bring the Stone of Balance into your opponent&rsquo;s camp to become a Kumo Hogosha!&#10;&#10;To become a Kumo Hogosha, you have to move the Stone of Balance outside the Rotating Arena, into your opponent's camp. The player who first succeeds wins. Possible actions that players can take are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Grabbing: The active Kumotori can grab and move another Kumotori (opponent or ally) one tile vertically or horizontally.&#10;     Throwing: The active Kumotori can throw another Kumotori (opponent or ally) one tile vertically or horizontally.&#10;     Running: The active Kumotori can move from his original position to neighboring tiles either vertically or horizontally.&#10;     Jumping: The active Kumotori can jump over one or more neighboring Kumotori (not diagonally) and/or the Stone of Balance to arrive at the next free tile.&#10;     Blocking: The active Kumotori can sit on top of a neighboring (not diagonally placed) opponent to block him. You cannot block a Kumotori who is on any of the eight tiles surrounding the Stone of Balance. In the next round, the active blocking player will perform an action to unblock the opponent Kumotori, and move to a neighboring tile (not diagonally).&#10;     Kumo: Kumo is the only action that moves the Stone of Balance. With this action you can move only 1 tile. To move the Stone of Balance you must have two Kumotori with the Kumo drawing face up next to each other, and next to the Stone of Balance.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dead of Winter is GMT&rsquo;s recreation of Richard Berg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Battles of the American Civil War series&rdquo; series title on the battle of Murfreesboro; also known as The Battle of Stone&rsquo;s River to Union Veterans. Perhaps one of the most evenly matched battles of the war, Murfreesboro/Stone&rsquo;s River pitted the Federal Army of the Cumberland under Major General William Starke Rosecrans against the Confederate Army of Tennessee captained by General Braxton Bragg. With near parity of numbers (each side fielded roughly 40,000 men) and remarkably similar battle plans, both armies grappled in the December cold for control of Middle Tennessee.&#10;&#10;The Series:&#10;&#10;The GBACW Series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental Level Gettysburg game - Terrible Swift Sword - created by Richard Berg in 1976. Since then, the series has undergone numerous system evolutions, always seeking to enhance the player&rsquo;s illusion of reality. Today, the series relies on inter-active chit-pull mechanics to simulate the sometimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield. GMT's Red Badge Of Courage and Gringo! Are the two most recent releases in this classic line of games.&#10;&#10;The Game:&#10;Dead of Winter II completely revisits this battle. The old version needed a face-lift. The biggest change is in returning the ground scale to 110 yards per hex.  While going to the larger scale means an increase in maps, the added elbow room allows for much more historical unit frontages and more playable stacking.&#10; One Introductory and ten regular scenarios examine every aspect of the historical battle and present the players with several plausible alternative situations based on events leading up to the actual engagement. Scenario sizes range from one-half of one map and an hour to play, to all four maps and many enjoyable gaming hours. Also included are a number of optional forces that could have plausibly been brought into the fight; Keep your opponent guessing as to what he will face next with this interesting range of options.&#10;&#10;The Team: &#10;While Richard Berg remains the final authority for all things GBACW, and John Alsen continues his invaluable role in the development of each title, Dead of Winter II adds one more well-known gaming name to the mix: Designer Dave Powell. Dave has designed more than a dozen civil war simulation games with The Gamers, Inc, (now owned by MMP.) Dave has always loved the GBACW since the moment he first opened the box for TSS, and welcomed the chance to bring his design talents and historical skills to the Dead of Winter project.&#10;&#10;The GMT game is the revised second version of Dead of Winter: The Battle of Stones River &#226;&#128;&#147; Murfreesboro, Tennessee by Simulation Design, Inc..&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Design: Dave Powell&#10;Series Design: Richard H.

    "Description": "The year is 1897 and to celebrate sixty years of the reign of Queen Victoria and bring much needed solace to the Country's weary workers, four seaside resorts vie with each other to be the grandest and most opulent, worthy of a Royal visit from Her Majesty herself. The latest in steam technology will be on display to attract and transport visitors to the hotels and guest houses that line the seafronts. Amusements and monuments will be created to edify and delight the visiting holiday-makers. You, as the designer of these developments must complete your resort first and claim your rightful place as Chief Architect, by Royal Appointment! Help is available from enigmatic and mysterious personages: Donkey-boy, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Madame Ice-cream. They may prove invaluable but are fickle and may aid your opponents, too!&#10;&#10;Steam Donkey is a card game that is fun but has depth to its strategic play. You will make decisions about when to take cards into your hand from the resort and whether to build in the Park, Beach or Town area. You, as the Architect will have to choose which characters will be of most use to you each turn and which projects they will help you construct. All for the glory of having the most magnificent resort in the land!&#10;&#10;An unusual mechanism in the game is that the reverse of each card is as important as its front. The reverse shows holiday-makers (&quot;the Visitors&quot;) arriving at a railway station complete with suitcases and their mechanical dog. The suitcases are color-coded to show the area of the resort to which the Visitors are destined. This area could be either the Park, the Town or the Beach. After they arrive, these same Visitors may be collected to the player's hand &mdash; but at this juncture the fronts of the cards become the focus of play. The players build amusements, lodgings, monuments and transport within the three areas, and this information is shown on the card fronts together with a point value. In order to build, a player discards a prescribed number of cards of the same type as the card being built. Of course, there is a little more to the game than this...&#10;&#10;Four Character cards &mdash; Madame Ice-cream, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Donkey-boy &mdash; are swapped between players to enhance card play, and four Kick-on cards in the advanced game &mdash; The Castle, Mechanical Dog, The Bank, and Feral Donkey &mdash; give the owning player a particular advantage and are retained throughout the game.&#10;&#10;",

You are one of these master artisans and together with your apprentice, you are competing with the other Masters to attain this elevated status in the town. To succeed, you'll have to impress the townspeople with your skills. How shall you do it? Will you acquire a specialist's mastery over certain material, or will you enlarge your workshop? Will you create a large number of smaller projects or will you build fewer, but greater, masterworks? That is for you to decide.&#10;&#10;Zong Shi blends worker placement, resource management, project completion and special action cards. To set up the game, lay out the project cards (eight types, each with a special power) and masterwork projects (only three at a time) on the game board; draw goods randomly for the two markets; lay out the exchange tiles in the pawn shop; and lay out a certain number of Scrolls of Fortune and material tiles. Players take turns drafting Scrolls (which have one-shot abilities) and materials (needed to complete projects), then the first round begins.&#10;&#10;In each round, players take one action with their master or apprentice, then take one action with their other figure. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Begin a project &ndash; Master only. Pay the material cost, then place the master on the time track in the space shown on the project.&#10;    Go to the market &ndash; Hang out and shoot the breeze until the next phase.&#10;    Go to the temple &ndash; Draw one Scroll (or more if your master is at the temple and donates material).&#10;    Go to the pawn shop &ndash; Choose an exchange tile in the shop and place the exchange tile on your player board. You may then swap one material shown on that tile for the other material on the tile.&#10;    Pay respectful visits &ndash; Visit a townsperson, donate materials of the right type equal to the visit tile you place there, then take the special action associated with that person this game.&#10;    Pass&#10;&#10;&#10;Those in the market then take turns choosing materials located there. You can hold no more than five materials. Players then advance their master on the time track to represent work on the project. Refill materials in the market, pass the start marker, then begin a new round.&#10;&#10;When a player completes his sixth project, players complete that round and one additional full round. Players tally points for completed projects, incomplete projects (which are penalized), number of townspeople visited, a full board of exchange tiles, completion of six projects and unused scrolls and material. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Now it is time for heroic deeds in The Boldest!&#10;&#10;&#10;Defeat mechanical monsters, retrieve enigmatic artifacts, use helpful items and lead your faction to glory. Each round, three expedition leave into the unknown to explore this mysterious place. You form three groups, one for each expedition, with the heroes in your hand. Only the strongest groups can take part in an expedition, so you need to apportion your power. Can you read your opponents well enough and forestall them? Collect the most experience and become a legend! Are you worthy of the title &ldquo;The Boldest&rdquo;?&#10;&#10; &#10;Max Prentis passionately created and illustrated the world of The Boldest. His love for details can be found on every card. The over 100 unique Illustrations let you delve into this rich world. Get ready to explore!&#10; Those of you who are curious and want a glimpse at the game mechanics are in luck because we want to give you a peak under the hood for the new, second game by Sophia Wagner (Noria was her first).&#10; The core mechanics of The Boldest are Hand Management, Programming and Hidden Bidding. &#10;Each player starts with a Faction consisting of 17 Starting Heroes from the 5 Classes (3 Warriors, 3 Technicians, 3 Hunters, 5 Cooks and 3 Pets).&#10; In the Planning Phase you secretly form three Groups with Heroes of the same Class behind your Screen and place them face down one Group per Planning Space.&#10;Every Hero executes a different Action in the following Action Phase but in general they let you take specific Forest Cards or new Heroes. &#10;Pets are the only exception they can be combined with any other Class. Why is that important?&#10; Because in the Action Phase only the strongest Groups can execute their Classes action. &#10;The Planning Spaces are resolved consecutively. First all players reveal their Group in Planning Space 1 and tell the other players the Class they played and the Group Strength (defined by the number of Class icons on the played cards). The strongest Group executes their action and afterwards sends their Leader to the king (this Hero is out of the game) while the remaining Heroes celebrate their success in the Party Tent. &#10;They won&rsquo;t be available next round to that player. Weaker Groups keep their Heroes and get a new one as compensation.&#10;&#10;As mentioned before, the Classes execute different Actions in a specific order: Warriors always go first followed by Technicians, Hunters and Cooks. The Cooks convince new Heroes with Special Abilities to join your Faction with their delicious dishes. The Warriors, Technicians and Hunters can take specific Forest Cards while other cards block their way. How the Forest changes over the course of three Expeditions of a round is also something you must anticipate during the Planning Phase. In the Action Phase you cannot change your Groups anymore.&#10;&#10;After 5 or 6 rounds (depending on the number of players) the player who was able to collect the most experience will be known as &quot;The Boldest&quot;!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Colonize the central landscape, attract animal species and increase their populations.&#10;&#10;A game of Biotopes is played in 5 or 6 Cycles depending on the chosen game mode.&#10;At the beginning of the game, you determine common sources of victory points.&#10;--These are the environmental conditions with which your ecosystems will have to deal in order to thrive.--&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each cycle, you will draw cubes of four different colors from your bag and place them on the Biotope cards of those colors.&#10;--This represents the organic matter extracted from your soil by the plants in your Ecosystem.--&#10;&#10;During the cycle you will take turns colonizing the central board and developing and optimizing your ecosystem.&#10;--The central board represents the landscape at a macro level in which the different ecosystems spread out and confront each other. Your board and cards represent your ecosystem at a micro level.--&#10;&#10;Your actions on the central board will allow you to expand, move your territories and even take territories from your opponents.&#10;Your actions in your ecosystem will allow you to play animal species cards, feed them by transferring the resources produced by your plants and make them reproduce in order to make your ecosystem prosper. Finally, to best optimize your future cycles, you will need to draw new cards to deal with new situations.&#10;--The cubes on your animal species cards represent the population of that species in your ecosystem.--&#10;&#10;Once you and your opponents have exhausted your options, the current cycle will end and you will start a new one. All the organic matter of your ecosystem used during this cycle will be put back in your bag, so it will be used again by your plants for the next cycle.&#10;Once all the cycles have been played, you can determine who wins the game by adding up all the victory points:&#10;&#10;--But be careful, if you have no more cubes on species cards, their populations will die out and they will not be taken into account for the calculation of victory points. Finally, beware of your distribution in the central landscape, a fragmented ecosystem is much less optimal and can grant malus.--&#10;&#10;",

The game went on to win the Best Strategic Card Game Award at the UK Games Expo 2013, along with Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles players use hands of 6 units, drawn from their total 'army' of 36 cards, playing one card per turn at the start of their turn.&#10;&#10;Cards have unique formations of Attack Arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played, and the damage they will do. Some cards also have Ranged Attack values. Each card then has a Defence value which, when exceeded by attacking cards, sees that card defeated.&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from their army deck to return their hand back up to 6 or retreat a unit that has not engaged in combat during that turn.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies - the Orcs and the Dwarves.&#10;&#10;These factions are differentiated by their exclusive cards and strategies; the Dwarf faction plays more defensively, using some Ranged cards and powerful Berserker units to pick-off assailants, while the Orc army encourages players to attack more vigorously, often committing kamikaze moves to their tactical advantage.&#10;&#10;Orcs versus Dwarves is cross-compatible with Elves versus Lizardmen, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict Ranking System, to create Mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;",

Each player can activate any Ghost on the main board, provided that its requirements are met. Players can also, at any time during their turn, occupy one or more Action Cards. These greatly enhance players&rsquo; options in the game. The game proceeds clockwise from the first player until the end of the game is triggered; this will happen when a player has completely run out of Haunt Tokens or if they occupy five Action Cards.

Therefore, balance between collecting resources should be kept in mind.&#10;&#10;You buy character and building cards from a central market to complete your resource set collections. Certain character and building cards cost 0 and give you 1 resource. For example: 1 beer. Other cards cost more: 1, 2 or 3 coins can give 2 beers or a victory point from the bread category by the end of the round.&#10;&#10;Other cards produce coins the moment they're bought, in connection the cards that you already possess.&#10;&#10;In Lut&egrave;ce, every player starts with a hand of cards that lets you pick a character and a building in the range of cards available. You collect 5 character and 5 building cards, visible to everyone at the time of selection.&#10;&#10;In order to choose the character or building card that you wish to have, place 2 cards facedown that correspond (number or letter) to the desired card in the market.&#10;&#10;Before revealing your choices, you can increase the value of your facedown cards by placing coins on your concealed cards. If 2 players want the same card, it is simply discarded and no one gets it!&#10;&#10;Increasing the value of the card allows you increase your chance of ensuring your bid, but will draw the attention of other players. If two players' increased values tie, no one gets the card, as it is discarded. Therefore, you have to watch other players and block them and place a daunting bit on your cards!&#10;&#10;If you don't have enough money, you also have two cards in your hand that bring you 3 coins each by playing them. At the end of the game, each set of 3 coins = 1 victory point.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, when everyone has drafted one or two cards, the market is replenished with new character and building cards. The cards that weren't selected during the round have a coin added to them (much like passing over a race in Smallworld), making them more attractive to bid upon, as you receive the corresponding coin as well, if you pick up that card. This continues, leaving a mountain of coins on unselected cards after several rounds!&#10;&#10;If you didn't win a card on your turn, you get two coins to keep you from crying!&#10;&#10;Note: The publisher compares this game to 7 Wonders.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Winner of the Charles S. Roberts Award for the best modern wargame of 2021, NATO: The Cold War Goes Hot, Designer Signature Edition marks the return of a true wargaming classic by Bruce Maxwell. NATO simulates a NATO/Warsaw Pact conflict in Central Europe during the Cold War years of the 1980s. First published in 1983, this game was Victory Games' best-selling title, purchased by over 75,000 gamers worldwide. This new edition is based on an exhaustive two-year study by the Designer of the records that have come to light since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The game combines highly accurate information on the forces the Warsaw Pact actually deployed with now de-classified reports from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency regarding WP capabilities. The map has been extensively updated using satellite photography. Finally, the game system has been reworked to better reflect the fluid, fast-paced, and deadly nature of modern warfare. Here is the ultimate Cold War game, remastered, and playable in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;NATO is a division/brigade-level simulation of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. The game map depicts the area from Denmark to the Swiss Alps, and from France to Poland.  The time frame covers the first 14 days of war, after which one side or the other has usually run out of an army. The game offers four different Scenarios covering 1) a surprise attack from a standing start, 2) an attempt by the WP to quietly prepare without tipping NATO off beforehand, 3) an extended buildup of forces by both sides before war breaks out, and 4) an introductory scenario covering the invasion of Denmark.&#10;&#10;Each Scenario can be played with an Order of Battle from 1983, when NATO was still relatively weak, or with an Order of Battle from 1988, when NATO had rearmed and reorganized and was at the peak of its strength. The difference is impressive.&#10;&#10;The game features infantry, armor, airborne and airmobile troops, and marines, with easy mechanics to leverage combined arms operations. It also has extensive options for employing helicopters, airpower, chemical weapons, and, as a last resort, nuclear weapons. The combat system is built around the concept that the best defense is a good offense, and features artillery, tactical and operational air strikes, flank attacks, concentric attacks, reserves, counterattacks, and deep exploitation, allowing for a rich set of tactical nuances in play.

These precious metals are delivered by your merchant ship for Victory Points at the Temple, one of the seven locations you'll be visiting in Ophir.&#10;&#10;To afford these precious building materials, you must navigate the region's seas against your rivals to collect goods to fulfill the demand at the Market for Coins, or exchange them for Favor at the Temple.&#10;&#10;Well-timed trades, efficient cargo storage, and tactical transportation will be the keys to your success. But you must be swift in your travels, because the game ends immediately once the construction of the Temple is complete. Will it be you whose name is spoken alongside the stories of Ophir's wonder?&#10;&#10;With its approachable map and exclusion of direct conflict, Ophir has a familiar and accessible atmosphere that families will enjoy. But with its modular setup, exclusive player roles, and mercurial market, Ophir has tactics, replayability, and tension for experienced gamers to savor!&#10;&#10;",

But you must act quickly, because a rival thief has the same plan.&#10;&#10;In Prowler&rsquo;s Passage, you and your rival burrow into the city through a network of underground passages to grab valuable items while attempting to gain control of key districts. Steal the best items, create the longest passages, and control districts to become the premier prowler!&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must (1) place a passage, then (2) collect the tile where you placed your passage, and (3) move control markers for the districts adjacent to that passage. The tile you collect will either be an item tile, which are scored in sets during each scoring phase, or a shovel tile, which allows you to move control markers further. You might also steal statues and/or complete achievements on your turn.&#10;&#10;Scoring occurs twice during the game. In each scoring phase, players gain wealth in these 5 categories:&#10;&#10;    PASSAGES: Gain 2 wealth for each section in your longest continuous passage.&#10;    STATUES: Gain 1 wealth for each statue you have stolen.&#10;    ITEMS: For each set of items of the same type that you have, you gain wealth. The bigger the set, the more wealth.&#10;    DISTRICTS: For each district you control (i.e., for which the control marker is on your side of the control track), you gain that district reward.&#10;    ACHIEVEMENTS: Gain wealth for the achievements you have claimed.

    "Description": "A kingdom stands on the brink of destruction, as the vast realm called the Shadow Deep slowly swallows everything in its path. As the army fights to contain the tide of evil creatures teeming up out of the black clouds, the kingdom&rsquo;s best soldiers, the rangers, must venture down into the shadows to gather information, rescue prisoners, and ambush enemy supply lines. It is a desperate fight against overwhelming odds, but every little victory brings another day of hope.&#10;&#10;Rangers of Shadow Deep is a solo and co-operative tabletop miniatures game, in which players create their ranger, gather companions, and play through a series of missions in their fight to hold back the darkness. If their rangers survive, they will grow in power and ability, and be sent on more difficult, dangerous and intricate assignments.&#10;&#10;So, what is going to make this &lsquo;Deluxe&rsquo;, I hear you ask? Well, to start off, it&rsquo;s getting top-notch production &ndash; traditional printing and binding, with a faux leather cover heat stamped with the artwork and text, and high-quality paper stock. The layout is being completely reworked, and the book will feature a dozen pieces of new artwork by Barrett Stanley. Additionally, I&rsquo;m taking the chance to incorporate the character building elements (most notably the spells) from Temple of Madness into the main rulebook, so that all of the character building will be in one place. I am also updating or modifying a few of the rules that I, and others, have been playtesting. Finally, I have introduced a &lsquo;challenge level&rsquo; for each of the scenarios in the book, which increases the difficulty of each scenario. This is for those that were finding the scenarios too easy for 3 or 4 players, for those who just like their games tougher, or for those who might want to play the scenarios again with higher-level rangers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description by the publisher&#10;&#10;",
