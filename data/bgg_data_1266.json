    "Description": "SUMMARY&#10;Valda: Rise of the Giants is a an expansion to Valda. As in the base game, it is a power-building strategy game where you as a viking warchief use divine powers, manage a village and resources, play powerful spells and build temples. You gather followers, fight off enemies and climb the steps to divinity.&#10;&#10;This expansion gives you the chance to discover the power of the Giants. 15 new cards for the base deck and 68 new Giant cards that offer you brand new powers with never before-seen graphics. A new powerful resource, 7 Giant powers, double sided action tokens and 5 new player boards complete this expansion.&#10;&#10;STORY&#10;All was peace and quiet in Asgard. The Gods continued being worshipped and led their easy immortal life. Until Hel, Queen of the Underworld wanted to broaden her empire. She seduces Surtur to form a powerful alliance. Thirsty for destruction Surtur calls his fellow brethren to reclaim their territory. After decades of hiding the Giants rise again. War is among us.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY (AND WIN)&#10;In Valda: the Rise of the Giants, you now have a choice between Gods and Giants and their powers to use to your advantage. &#10;Now every player finishes 4 phases during their turn. The player starts with the Valda phase where he/she scavenge and explore the newly formed world by drafting and playing cards and actions. Building temples in the different God or Giant domains is an important way to gain divine abilities, and get access to more powerful spells. The attack phase is played similar to the base game. So every player can attack the player in turn once. In the follower phase you worship a God or Giant by building a temple in the specific God or Giant area. Resources (divine blood, gold, diamonds, runes), cards or (dice) eyes can be transferred into followers. In the last phase you roll dice to harvest rare resources for your tribe.&#10;&#10;The viking chieftan who has the most followers when the ship arrives in Asgard, is worthy enough to climb the world tree Yggdrasil and becomes a God! Oh.. and he/she also wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If they look at the baked good card, they can add it to the stack of orders to be fulfilled, or discard it and hide one of the eight notes with the magic spells on them.&#10;&#10;When only one player remains, they attempt to bake all of the bread. Each bread card has a die combination that needs to be made. They only get a single roll, but the remaining spell cards  will help them reroll or manipulate the dice, and they can bribe other players to reroll the dice for them.&#10;&#10;If a player succeeds, they earn the tip pool and the value of all of the items they baked. If they fail, they get nothing; the second time they fail, they are fired (eliminated from the game.)&#10;&#10;The goal is to be the first to get to a set goal of money, or the last person still employed.&#10;&#10;",

The second phase of the game has players receiving cards with a scenario and the other players respond to this scenario with pre-written one-liners on cards of their own. Points are tallied from both phases and a loser is declared-- whoever has the least amount of points-- and this losing player receives a card that delivers them some sort of silly &quot;punishment&quot;.&#10;&#10;Note: This edition was a Walgreen exclusive.&#10;&#10;",

They match the creepy dusk to dawn aesthetics of the pitch &ndash; each dugout featuring Score, Turn, and Re-roll trackers, plus Reserves, Knocked-out, and Casualty boxes. You'll also find rules to represent the particular features of both sides of the pitch.&#10;&#10;Necromantic Horror teams are compatible with the 2016 Edition of Blood Bowl using the &quot;Teams of Legend&quot; optional rules published by Games-Workshop.&#10;&#10;",

The whole game fits on a postcard and there are different postcards for different cities with unique mechanics.&#10;&#10;The game runs in 2 phases. In the first phase the heroes try to stop the villain's plans before he becomes too strong. The villain first collects threat markers based on the behaviour of the heroes in the last round and the current scenario. These are distributed to the different plans. Then the Heroes can recharge and use their abilities by forming 2 pairs from 4 dice rolled and taking an action marker with the corresponding number. If the number is no longer available, it cannot be taken. And if no available or already taken number is rolled and the dice cannot be manipulated with the hero's abilities, the hero loses all markers collected in this round. Heroes can decide to end their turn at any time, in which case they may use their markers to prevent the villain's plans, reduce damage or recharge their abilities. Once all heroes have finished their turn, the villain's unresolved plans are handled and his power increases according to the heroes' behaviour.&#10;When all plans have been foiled or the villain has become too strong, it comes to the grand finale, in which the heroes must defeat the villain. The heroes must complete tasks based on the action markers they have placed during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;This game was designed during the second corona wave and has several free to download scenarios, to bring some boardgames to everybody during the social distance time. You can also send the postcard with game to your game playing friends and Relatives. You can also support your local game store with this game, as there are several special scenario postcards, which are exclusive available in local game stores.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If you can match all of the icons on a reward, discard the supplies and take the reward, which will be valued between 4-7 points; however, the only way to get more of the necessary supplies is to sell a reward by flipping it face down and drawing as many supply cards as the card's point value.

    "Description": "The first expansion for Commands &amp; Colors: Medieval.&#10;&#10;The original plan was to have the Medieval expansions follow a somewhat historical timeline, but to keep in tune with player requests and feedback, GMT chose to jump ahead in time some 500 plus years to the Crusades. Actually reflecting on the decision, this jump makes a lot of sense, since there are marked similarities with many Byzantine battles as featured in the Medieval game and the battles fought during the Crusades gameplay wise, rule wise and transitional-thinking wise.&#10;&#10;Yes, there are plenty of knights in shining armor in this expansion, but there are no damsels in distress or dragons to be slain. The Crusade Mid-Eastern Battles I expansion will instead focus on some of the major engagements of earlier Crusader history. In this first Crusade expansion, we showcase at least 16 Crusader scenarios and all the additional unit blocks you need to fight out these battles. New units include: Crossbow Infantry, Foot Knight Infantry, Turcopole Light Bow Cavalry, Heavy Knight Cavalry, and Heavy Military Order Knight Cavalry.&#10;&#10;The Crusade expansion introduces many new game concepts as well: Impetuous Pursuit, Feigned Flight, Shower Shooting, and Charging Cavalry ability to pass through friendly stationary infantry units, all of which add historical depth and flavor. Still many game mechanics remain constant, like the deck of Medieval Command cards that drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; and the battle dice that will resolve combat quickly and efficiently. There are also new and updated Inspired Actions for both the Crusader and Mid-Eastern armies.&#10; The stylized battlefield scenario maps still emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. Like your Medieval core game, the scale of the Crusade expansion is flexible and can vary from battle to battle. Yet to gain victory (and I have stated this many times before), the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Crusader and Mid-Eastern army units, their weapons, terrain, and the history.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.&#10;&#10;Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.&#10;&#10;",

You'll be handsomely rewarded if you do!&#10;&#10;With the Fly, Butterfly mini-expansion, players will add butterfly tiles to replace leaf tiles from the base game and place the butterfly on one of these new butterfly tiles to start the game. Whenever a player's bee lands on a tile adjacent to the butterfly, the player will get an option to move a stored nectar to a different empty chamber without the normal restrictions. Then that player gets to move the butterfly to a different butterfly tile.&#10;&#10;",

We took the drafting, strategy, bluffing and intensity of your favourite TCG games and removed all of the hassle. One box between players, endless replayability.&#10;&#10;Players draft or use pre-constructed 21-card decks to compete for points across five rounds. Each round, players take turns to play cards and characters from the Ophelia multiverse onto the board, activating abilities and contesting lanes to swing the chances of glory in their favour.&#10;&#10;When the dust settles, only one player will be awarded the points. The board is wiped clean, and a new round begins. When a player reaches 5 points, they are declared the victor.

    "Description": "How would you have fared as one Napoleon's marshals, or in command of a division of redoutable British redcoats under Wellington? Grand Battery offers you the chance to find out. This book includes all the rules you need to play miniature wargames set in the Napoleonic Wars, plus plenty of useful background information you need to get started.&#10;&#10;There is a concise historical overview of the events and battles of the period, as well as sections on the weapons and tactics of the various armies. The buyer's guide gives an up-to-date survey of the wealth of ranges of miniatures available and advice on which are compatible with which. Organizational tables give a breakdown of typical formations for all the major combatants and most of the minor ones (any one for a Wurttemburg infantry division?), allowing you to structure your collection and also to organize hypothetical games quickly with 'off the peg' orders of battle. Three historical scenarios are also included, each with their own specific orders of battle, maps, objectives and victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The rules themselves, which utilize an innovative card-driven turn sequence to simulate the unpredictable ebb and flow of battle, are designed for playability, while still giving 'realistic' results and rewarding sound tactics. Though designed primarily for division level games with 25 or 15mm figures, the command and control sysyem takes account of corps or even the largest army level games and they are easily adaptable to any figure scale.&#10;&#10;Get ready to march to the sound of the guns!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The enjoyment of wargaming is greatly enhanced if the battles (games) are played within well thought-out scenarios. Instead of simply lining up evenly-matched armies and fighting to the death, the players can have realistic objectives (such as the capture of a vital piece of terrain or delaying a superior enemy to cover a retreat) and be confronted with more challenging tactical decisions. Devising such scenarios can take a lot of effort, and more critically, time, which is always in short supply. This book is designed to take the time and effort out of organising fascinating and challenging wargames set in the Peninsular War.&#10;&#10;In addition to 20 carefully devised scenarios of varying size and complexity, this book contains a concise introduction to the theatre of operations and an integrated chronology of battles and campaigns, showing where the scenarios fit into the wider events. The scenarios and orders of battle are intended for use with Pen &amp; Sword's own Napoleonic wargame rules, Grand Battery, but they are easily adaptable for use with other leading systems.&#10;&#10;&bull; Briefing notes on the context of the battle and the dilemmas and objectives facing each commander. Orders of battle for each side and any other information required to set up.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&bull; Concise introduction to the Peninsular War with chronology to place the scenarios in context.&#10;&bull; 20 carefully devised scenarios of varying size and complexity.&#10;&bull; a wargamer-friendly map, showing players where to place terrain, buildings and other features that had an impact on the battlefield. It will also show initial dispositions (historical) and mark the point of entrance (or exit) of units during the battle.&#10;&bull; Clear win/lose/draw conditions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trigon is a tile placement game by Wilhelm Kienzle from 1951 and was published by Naef in 1958.&#10;Each player gets a set of 9 similar right triangles (5 different sizes) that form a geometric sequence.&#10;All 9 tiles together form a square with a square hole in which a cube (the die) lies.&#10;A triangle is made up of two smaller ones in the sequence.&#10;The side lengths of the triangle are based on the golden section.&#10;&#10;You can find more in the book &quot;Kurt Naef: Der Spielzeugmacher&quot;.&#10;All tiles and the box are made of wood in high quality.&#10;&#10;The game: A player rolls the die that dertemines a specific size, 6 meaning any choice. The player places the triangle on the table. In turn order, the other players place one of their triangles adjacent to the last played triangle with the same length (similar to the principle of domino). A player who cannot do so must pass. The player who gets rid of all his triangles wins.&#10;&#10;In addition, mathematical facts are presented about the Golden section, the theorem of Pythagoras and about parallelograms. There a puzzles presented to be solved as well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
