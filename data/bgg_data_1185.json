Even units that did not fight, but were close enough to be put into the fight should the player so choose are included.  It also serves as a great companion to the player who already has the rules as it provides additional scenarios, as well as cut-outs for the game, such as color coded order and number markers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shipwrecked with strangers in the middle of the ocean, with scarce resources and even scarcer trust in each other. As tension rises and starvation sets in, your companions may be more inclined to throw you overboard to make rations last longer. All while mother nature is doing her best to ensure that no one is returning home. Calenture is a social deduction-game in which you have to gather your collective resources to keep the crew alive. But who can you trust when the food turns up spoiled and nobody seems to know where the gun has gone?&#10;&#10;More in-depth:&#10;&#10;Calenture's playtime is 20-40 minutes and the game includes mechanics such as hidden agendas, resource and card management, random event cards, bluffing and player elimination. Some players will be in it for themselves while others are protectors or saboteurs. You win the game by fulfilling your agenda which most of the time also involves surviving. The game ends when all the players are either dead or rescued. There can be multiple winners or even no winners at all. When the players reach the bottom of the event deck they will get a chance to be rescued, but there will not always be room for all of them.&#10;&#10;Players will draw cards from a deck of items. It can be food, weapons and other items that can help or hinder the survival of the group.&#10;&#10;The game will throw random events at you, most of the time it involves a challenge that will need to be overcome or something that reveals information about the players. Maybe a storm hits that throws a random card out of the hands of all the players, maybe someone gets to look at the hand of another player and steal a card or just maybe a shark will attack and threaten to eat someone unless they either bribe it with food or hunt it away with the gun. Frequently the event cards will trigger starvation, when this happens the group will contribute item cards to feed the group. But you can contribute as much or as little as you like and the cards will be face down and shuffled so it will be harder to know who put in what. There are no restrictions on what items can be contributed and cards like rat-poison that spoils the food exists.&#10;&#10;The game features both a lot of opportunities to be sneaky and manipulative as well as giving the players tools to get information on their fellow players intentions. If a saboteur is caught the group can vote to throw them overboard if they have the majority so it is of utmost importance to know when to lay low and when to strike.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If there are an even number of players, judging is done by the collective.&#10;&#10;Describers may NOT use their hands or mention any colors seen on the face card. Sketchers may NOT ask any questions and must immediately stop sketching as soon as the 2 minute round is up.&#10;&#10;When playing with an ODD number of players, teams BET on the sketch they think the judge will choose as the winner. &#10;Players on the WINNING team each earn 2 points, + an additional point if they bet on their own sketch.&#10;Players on losing teams can earn 1 point for the round if they bet on the correct sketch.&#10;&#10;When playing with an EVEN number of players, there is no betting, however, WINNING teams will earn 3 points if the card they sketched was rated as a &quot;high-difficulty&quot; card (as indicated by a &quot;+&quot; in the top left corner of the card.) Otherwise, they will earn the standard 2 points.&#10;&#10;After each round, players rotate counter-clockwise, causing some players to change roles, and play continues. The number of rounds is equal to the number of players at the table. Eventually, all players will have &quot;teamed up&quot; with every player at the table; played an equal number of rounds as sketcher and describer; and have been a judge once.&#10;&#10;The SINGLE player with the most points at the end of the game wins. If there is a tie, there is a Face-Off.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An edge-of-your-seat card and dice game that lets you brawl with 2-4+ players.&#10;&#10;Choose your action and your target opponent, then throw down your cards and see who gets hit.&#10;&#10;Roll for Damage, then pick up your cards and the next round starts, choose again!&#10;&#10;Rounds continue until only one player has health points.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of 5 action cards: Uppercut, Body-slam, Leg Sweep, Guard, and Dodge.&#10;Each player also has a card representing each opponent.&#10;&#10;Basic Game Rules &#10;Players start the game with a Pain Limit of 20. Rounds are played with each Player acting simultaneously. Each round has three phases: Playing Action cards(and Target cards for 3+ players) face down; revealing cards and determining hits; and finally, rolling and gaining Pain.  Whenever a player is hit by an attack they gain 1d6 of Pain. When a Player's Pain value meets or exceeds their Pain Limit, that Player is knocked out. When all but one Player has been knocked out, that Player wins the game! &#10;1 V 1 Duel &#10;All games of ThrowDown eventually end up here, but some games start out here. &#10;When down to just two Players, they each start the game with only the Leg Sweep, Uppercut, and Bodyslam cards in hand. Players take their turns at the same time. For each round, the Players choose an Action Card and place it face down on the table. When both Players have placed their Action cards, they reveal them at the same time. The Actions are compared to determine which player hits. That Player rolls 1d6 and the other player gains that much pain. Then the cards go back to their players hands for the next round.&#10;&#10;3 or more Player Throwdown&#10;Throwdown can be played with as many Players as you have cards for! With 3 or more Players, each plays with one of each Action Card in their hand, as well as a Target card for each player other than themselves. &#10;Rounds play out in the same 3 phases mentioned above and outlined here: &#10;Choose your action and which Player you&rsquo;re going to Target, then place the chosen Action Card and Target card face down in front of you. When all players have done this, move to phase 2.&#10;Everyone reveals their choices at the same time. Figure out who is targeting who, whether any moves are negated by its counter-move, and note any defensive Actions. &#10;If a Player has chosen the Dodge action and two or more attacks have targeted that Player, the dodging Player chooses one of the attacks targeting them to be negated.&#10;Any attack Actions (Leg Sweep, Bodyslam, Uppercut) that haven&rsquo;t been negated score a hit! Those Players each roll 1d6 and inflict that much Pain on their Target. The Targets track the Pain they&rsquo;ve gained on their Pain Limit trackers [or a d20 if ya nasty ;) ]&#10;If two Players target each other with the same attack Action, they both roll 1d6, whoever rolls higher inflicts Pain on the other equal to the difference of the dice values. If the dice are a tie, neither Player gains any Pain.&#10;    Then all Players return their Actions and Target cards to their hands, and those who still haven&rsquo;t reached their Pain Limit proceed to the next round. Rounds continue until one Player is left.&#10;&#10;Action Cards&#10;Leg Sweep = Deals 1d6 Pain to a single target, negates Uppercut Attacks targeting this Player&#10;&#10;Bodyslam = Deals 1d6 Pain to a single target, negates Leg Sweep Attacks targeting this Player&#10;&#10;Uppercut = Deals 1d6 Pain to a single target, negates Bodyslam Attacks targeting this Player&#10;(1 vs 1 style play only uses these three cards for each Player&rsquo;s hand.)&#10;&#10;Guard = Cause no Pain and take half Pain from ALL  attacks targeting you this round.&#10;&#10;Dodge= Cause no Pain, and also avoid Pain from ONE attack of your choice, targeting you this round.&#10;    &#10;Guard and Dodge actions do not use a Target card, but for the game to work you still need to play a Target card when playing either of these Action cards. If you don&rsquo;t play the Target card, the other Players will know that you are not using an attack Action.     &#10;Example 1: Player 1 plays a Bodyslam and Player 2 plays a Leg Sweep targeting Player 1; this resolves with Player 1 rolling to dole out 1d6 of Pain and Player 2&rsquo;s attack being negated. &#10;        &#10;Example 2: Player 1 and Player 2 each Target each other with Uppercut. Both Players roll 1d6. Player 1 rolls a five, Player 2 rolls a two. Player 1 will inflict three(five minus two) Pain on Player 2&#10;&#10;Target Cards:    A set of cards in each Player's hand that they use to pick their targets in a 3+ Throwdown. Target cards will have a single number on one side. Players will have a Target card in their hand for each opponent. During the first phase of each round, a Player lays down a target Card with the same number as the Player they are wanting to attack. The Target card with their own Player number on it goes face up in front of that Player, for the duration of the game, as a visual reminder of which number is used to Target them. Normally Players don&rsquo;t hold on to the Target Card with their own Player Number on it. No real sense in targeting and inflicting pain on yourself.&#10;&#10;Pain Trackers And Player Tokens: Players use the Pain trackers with Player Tokens to keep track of the Pain Value. Players Start the game with the tokens on 0 and as they accrue more pain they move their Player Token up the Pain Tracker.&#10;&#10;1d6 per Player for Pain rolling&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer (updated 1/26/23)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;How the West was Saved: the Russo-Polish War 1920&quot; is a two&ndash;player strategic wargame based upon the Russo &ndash; Polish War from April 1920, when the Poles were poised to attack Kiev, until October 1920 when the War effectively came to an end. One player commands the Polish and Ukrainian armies; the other commands the Russians (and their Lithuanian allies if Lithuania joins the conflict). Generally, each counter denotes a cavalry or infantry division or an artillery train; but, some smaller brigades and regiments are also represented.&#10;&#10;This was a war of manoeuvre fought over huge distances with relatively small armies. As a consequence, even though both sides were well equipped for defence - possessing artillery, barbed wire and machine guns - a combination of vast open spaces and rudimentary reconnaissance meant that, unlike on the crowded battlefields of WW1, defensive positions could often be outflanked and overrun before reinforcements arrived.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are designed to reflect this fog of war. Players only have a certain number of resource points each turn to supply and to move units. As supply lines extend so, just as happened historically, they become increasingly vulnerable, and strategic options reduce. Players take it in turns to allocate Activation Markers to units that they wish to move; but, their orders may not be received or obeyed. The direction that a unit is facing is integral to the combat system, recognising the importance of flanking manoeuvres.&#10;&#10;The war was a fascinating mix of ancient and modern. With cavalry operating alongside aircraft, armoured trains and tanks, and carrier pigeons alongside field radios. It also featured some of the characters who were to become icons of the twentieth-century: Churchill, de Gaulle, Lenin, Pilsudski, Stalin and Trotsky.  This rich tapestry of equipment, characters and events is captured in Cards to reflect the random events and extraneous factors which the Gods chose to cast down upon those caught up in the tumultuous events which unfolded in Eastern Europe during the fateful year of 1920.&#10;&#10;Box contents:&#10;&bull; 16-page Rulebook,&#10;&bull; Set Up Card,&#10;&bull; Two Six-sided Dice (2D6): One Red, One White,&#10;&bull; mounted 48 x 68 cm map showing territories between Warsaw and Smolensk,&#10;&bull; 216 unit counters and game markers, and&#10;&bull; 40 laminated Random Event Cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Years before the War of the Ring, the Dark Lord Sauron tried to bend the will of the kings and rulers of the Free Peoples with subtle machinations. His goal was to turn them into powerless puppets, or at least to weaken them in preparation of his plans for conquest. When the war came, they fought the Dark Lord valiantly, but for some of them the weakness that Sauron nurtured proved almost fatal.&#10;&#10;The role of the rulers of the Free Peoples, and their weaknesses, is the focus of Kings of Middle-earth, the third expansion for War of the Ring. The part they played in the story is greatly expanded, with new figures and rules that bring to life Theod&eacute;n, Denethor, Da&igrave;n, Brand, and Thranduil. Additional characters to expand the Shadow Armies, the Dark Chieftains, are also included.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On April 24th, 1778 along The North Channel between Ireland and Scotland --Captain John Paul Jones of the USS Ranger set out to seize and capture a Royal Navy ship just outside the town of Carrickfergus. That ship was the HMS Drake, captained by George Burden. Jones immediately had the upper hand, in both firepower and maneuverability. The Ranger was built as a warship while the Drake was simply a merchant ship outfitted with 4-pound cannons. Not to mention, Jones had the upper hand in knowledge of the enemy ship, given to him by an area local Lieut.Dobbs. During the ensuing attack, the Ranger inflicted devastating damage to her opponent--killing its captain in the process. &#10;The ships fought in close range combat, but never close enough for boarding actions. In the end, Jones succeeded in capturing the Drake and as a result, gained international fame.&#10;&#10;North Channel is a simple table-top &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; wargame of ship-to-ship combat for two players. &#10;One player will take on the role of the American ship the USS Ranger, while the other takes on the role of the HMS Drake. &#10;The American player will have the upper hand with higher firepower, a larger crew, and a sturdier hull (as it was historically). &#10;The British player will have to be smart (and lucky) in order to outmaneuver their enemy, and not succumb to the USS Ranger.&#10;&#10;Will you be able to change history?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Commander&rsquo;s Log - Solardate 11.12.30&#10;Due to an unforeseen systems malfunction, while passing through an anomaly, our warp drive has lost all power. Additionally, it has managed to power down all of our weapons systems onboard the U.S.S. Frontiersman. Usually, such a malfunction would be little more than a minor setback. It may even prove a useful piece of scientific and engineering research as the crew works on solving the problem and figuring out why the anomaly effects out ship in the first place.&#10;&#10;However, things seem a bit more dire for us at the moment. The anomaly was right on the outer reaches of Kornathian space and we&rsquo;ve been set adrift near one of their war parties. They have no desire to stop and discuss the situation or work out terms of peaceful negotiation. Instead, they have opened fire upon us.&#10;&#10;I, as the commanding officer of this ship, can not simply let this be. I have men and women aboard I need to protect. As such, we will continue to work on fixing the warp drive and powering up our weapons, all the while we will fight off these unwanted attacks. It seems our choices are either to get the warp drive back up and running, so we can light jump out of here, or defeat the capital ship that is leading the war party against us.&quot;&#10;&#10;Charge Stations! is a science fiction roll+write game where a single player takes command of the U.S.S. Frontiersman. It is up to the player to repair the ship all while fighting off incoming attacks. This is done by rolling handfuls of six-sided dice (D6s) which represent the ship&rsquo;s crew members and assigning them to various tasks around the ship. All you need to play is a pencil, some dice, and this book.&#10;&#10;",

If an excuse is needed, assume the European powers - who have been engaged in bitter fighting in Europe as well as New France - have begun to believe the tales of magic &amp; fabled treasures coming from New England. Why not send a regiment or two to establish dominance in the area? The local colonists are incapable of even keeping the natives at bay, so the area looks ripe for plunder!&#10;&#10;",

Players want to make other players spend their money and the best way of doing that is to become a Ho and service a John, who in turn must pay the Ho. Once a player is unable to pay an amount due they must sell their Ho shoe to the Vault for $500, they then use that money to pay their debt. The Ho shoe is put up for auction and players take turns bidding on the Ho shoe until a highest bidder is reached. As long as a player still has money they are in the game even if they sold their Ho shoe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The reality is, the entire war wasn't a giant siege. Early in the war and later as well, the first world war was truly a war of manure and fluidity, many other fronts such as the eastern front and the middle east continued to be much more fluent then the western front. This scenario can be used to represent any meeting engagement at any period of the war.&#10;&#10;This is a great scenario for playing pickup games or even tournament games.&#10;&#10;",

Some argue it was the victory at Vimy which allowed Canada to emerge from Great Britain's shadow, the Canadian Corps would earn the reputation of the allied shock troops. This reputation was won at a cost though, the Canadian Corps would lose over 10,000 dead and wounded.&#10;&#10;The Battle for Vimy Ridge is a supplement for the Through the Mud and Blood Divisional scale ruleset by Dobbies Hobbies.&#10;&#10;The Battle for Vimy Ridge will give you four historical scenarios recreating the Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge in 1917.

More than just providing the information compatible with Command at Sea, this data is now in the same format as Harpoon4, Fear God &amp; Dread Nought, and Dawn of the Battleship, the other core games in the Admiralty Trilogy. &#10;All ships and aircraft extant from 1939 to 1945 are included in the supplement, as well as several projected or hypothetical platforms, such as the Soviet Stalingrad class battlecruiser, the original design of the Dutch Eendracht class light cruiser, and the Finnish Humu fighter.&#10;&#10;Arctic Fleets uses the 2012 Standard, an improved formula used to calculate a ship&rsquo;s damage points.&#10;&#10;Please make sure that all ships on both sides in a scenario are using either the older 2006 Standard, or the new 2012 Standard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rising Sun provides scenarios for the Admiralty Trilogy&rsquo;s WW II tactical naval game system, Command at Sea. &#10;Starting with Pearl Harbor, it covers the fierce surface, submarine, and air combats of the first half of the Pacific War, with detailed orders of battle, and historical accounts.&#10;&#10;The original edition of Rising Sun was the first supplement published for Command at Sea, in 1994. Over the past twenty-plus years, new scholarship and access to previously unavailable sources (not to mention the designers&rsquo; own greater understanding) has allowed us to produce this vastly improved edition.&#10;&#10;In addition to classic set-piece battles like Pearl Harbor or the midget submarine attack on Sydney, Australia, major campaigns like Coral Sea and Midway are presented as a series of linked scenarios, with possible variations and historical might-have-beens. Background information is provided to help the players place the battles in context.&#10;&#10;Noted historian Jon Parshall, co-author of Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway, graciously wrote the foreword for this edition. His work, along with other researchers and authors, has helped us greatly in understanding Midway and the other battles published here.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While Rommel&rsquo;s Afrika Korps was capturing the attention of the world, its fate was being decided in the Mediterranean. No matter how brilliantly the general and his troops performed, they could not win without the supplies and equipment necessary to fight.&#10;&#10;Supermarina I protrays the struggle for naval supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea as the Allied forces tried to break the vital supply link for Axis forces in North Africa.&#10;&#10;Containing 24 scenarios, Supermarina I runs the gamut of submarine versus convoy actions to battleships and cruisers slugging it out off Cape Teulada (Spartivento). Famous battles like Taranto and Matapan are included, as well as several scenarios suitable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;This supplement for the Command at Sea tactical WW II miniatures game allows the player to make the kind of decisions a ship or a battle group commander faced in combat. Victory depends on understanding the situation and making the right choices.&#10;&#10;This supplement uses the ships and aircraft from Mediterranean Fleets and Home Fleet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Glyph Dice Adventures is a multi-genre storytelling game. Players take turns rolling the dice and making up entertaining stories using the glyphs shown &mdash; the other player&rsquo;s award gems based many they think the story deserves.&#10;&#10;The game includes 6 glyph dice, 32 gem card, and 4 chest cards. Each player starts with a chest card which is placed next to them on the table. They also get a set of Gem cards (1x 4 gem cards, 2x 3 gem cards, 3x 2 gem cards, and 2x 1 gem cards) which becomes their hand.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 3-4 players, with the starting player being the oldest and wisest player. The starting player rolls the dice. From the dice, he/she tells a story using all the dice. The other players then decide on how many gems the story deserves and secretly gives the current player one of his/her gem cards. The current player places the gem cards he/she received from the other players in his/her treasure chest without looking at the cards. Then the next player to the left rolls the dice. Play continues until each player has rolled the dice twice.&#10;&#10;All the gems in each player's chest are totaled. The player with the most gems wins the game. Any remaining gem cards are deducted from the player's total. If there is a tie, all tied players win.&#10;&#10;VARIANTS: &#10;Creative Play (1-4 players): You only need the dice for this variant Have fun rolling the dice and coming up with creative stories. No scoring system is used because everyone who plays is a winner. &#10;Challenge Play (3-4 players): Play as the normal rules but only roll one dice at a time, continuing your story with each die roll added.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
