    "Description": "An implementation of a dice bluffing game, similar to Liar's Dice.  A player, the &quot;Declarer&quot; rolls the dice and announces what poker hand is under the cup.  The player to the left, the &quot;Caller&quot;, announces whether he or she believes the Declarer.  If the Caller believes the Declarer then the Caller takes the cups and is the new declarer, and must declare a higher poker hand from the dice under the cups, with the player to the left as the new Caller.  Play continues until a Caller accuses the Declarer of being a liar, and the dice are revealed.  If the Declarer was lying then the declarer must pay out, but if the Declarer was telling the truth, the Declarer collects from the other players.&#10;&#10;The rules as printed don't give a lot of detail about the game.  Though money is provided, it's not made clear how bets take place, nor what the game ending conditions are.  Presumably, like Liar's Dice, the game would end when one player has all of the money, and players would be eliminated when they have no money.&#10;&#10;Unlike Liar's Dice, only one player is rolling at one time, and there are a total of five dice that are rolled.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game has a plastic version of a cornucopia (horn) into which various objects are placed. There  are 6 different objects: a wooden marble, a wooden cylinder, a wooden block, a bell, a metal marble and a piece of cloth. There is also a set of 40 cards which have photos of different mixes of the objects and also a '?' allowing for your own object.&#10;&#10;4 cards are turned over and one player secretly chooses one of the cards and fills the horn with the objects shown in that picture. The horn is closed and the next player shakes it and tries to guess which card has been used by the sounds that are made.&#10;&#10;The game is intended to develop the ability to pick out different sounds. The original 2001 prototype made by Reinhold Wittig (titled Das F&uuml;llhorn) had an African animal horn which was filled.&#10;&#10;",

To do so, you have to make a political program, taking left, right and center positions on issues such as NATO, taxes or autonomy. You'll have to get money, needed for the electoral campaign, to pay publicity, meetings, or launch attacks against other political parties to snatch votes away from them.&#10;&#10;In The Political Game, an ideal game for groups, like in politics, agreements with other political forces are indispensable.&#10;&#10;You'll have to negotiate with the other players, make agreements with them, and betray them if you're interested in doing so.  You may loan them money to attack your most fierce rivals, and exchange favors or information.  Everything is valid in your effort to win the elections!&#10;&#10;",

Inside each house are squares that are the possible rooms where the murder could have occurred.&#10;&#10;There are three possible murder weapons - gun, knife or poison, and four tokens for each type.&#10;&#10;There are 12 murder victims tokens - male or female under blankets that were each one of six different colors. The feet sticking out from under the blanket indicate the gender - small feet in little black heels for the females; large black dress shoes for the males.&#10;&#10;There were 12 murderer tokens - people of different dress and hair colors - 6 possible clothing colors, 6 possible hair colors, two genders.&#10;&#10;There were 7 types of cards with 6 in each - hair color, clothing color, gender, murder weapon, victim gender, victim blanket color, and location (country or city).&#10;&#10;As players take turns, the murder rooms will gradually become populated with murders, victims and weapons - one of each in each room, and the players hands will gradually get one of each card type. The goal is to get the cards in your hand to exactly match one of the murder rooms. The first person to do so wins.&#10;&#10;When you roll the number for a card type you *already* have in your hand, you get to pick up all the cards of that type still in the pile, look at all of them, and exchange any one of them for the one in your hand, if you want to do so.&#10;&#10;",

In H and H you play a civic minded developer tasked with the goal of generating additional profits for your investors while improving the lives of the citizens along a warm, rich, tropical coast that has recently emerged from a long time dictatorship.  You score points by developing provinces along the coast, bringing tourists to your resorts, and avoiding devastating hurricanes. Tourists are fickle and don&rsquo;t take well to nasty storms and other calamities, but are comfortable in places well protected from natures fury while being furnished with amenities and goods. Players rush to fill the limited capacity of each province while placing &quot;clouds&quot; along specified tracks which will generate hurricanes that can strike their opponents cities and send their tourists packing.&#10;&#10;H and H is a medium weight Euro game, similar in length to Ticket to Ride or Thurn and Taxis, with more strategic decisions than either of those games.  Its designed as a quick FUN game with plenty of strategy.&#10;&#10;Objective:&#10;To invest in this region, bring tourists and score the most victory points after a predetermined number of hurricane strikes.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;The Game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, signaled by the strike of a hurricane.  Typical game length is between 3-4 hurricanes (1-1.5 hours).&#10;The game is played with a deck of cards with special actions and bonuses and disasters, a game board representing a small coastal region, and wooden bits to keep track of tourists and improvements.&#10;&#10;Card Management&#10;Players start with 5 cards in their hand. Players may not have more than 9 cards at the end of any turn.&#10;A turn consists of 3 actions, from one of the following combinations:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Play 3 actions&#10;     Draw 3 cards&#10;     Play 1 action draw 2 cards&#10;     Play 2 Actions draw 1 card&#10;&#10;&#10;Choice is declared before any cards are drawn or played.&#10;&#10;After each hurricane has been played out that ends a season, and the deck is re-shuffled.  At the end of each season all remaining tourists score points.  Three to five hurricane seasons are played out, and the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Dice rolls determine movement. You can jump single enemies (except uphill) and flip them over to become yours. A piece landing on the summit becomes a Field Marshal, which cannot be jumped but may leap and convert entire rows of enemies. However, there can only be one Field Marshal, whose allegiance proves difficult to retain; it must vacate the sacred peak immediately, allowing others to reach it and wrest control. Things can get hectic, but patiently blocking upwardly mobile forces in order to keep the fickle Field Marshal loyal usually wins. Still, this is a feisty game that can literally be enjoyed at all levels.&#10;&#10;",

Players link pairs of matching Oompa-Loompas by placing the Squominos in a spiral shape.&#10;&#10;Players start with 7 Squominos. If they cannot play a Squomino on their turn, they pick one up from the pool. The winner is the first to run out of Squominos.&#10;&#10;Therefore the choice is which Squomino to use, not where.&#10;&#10;There are 58 Squominos, including 3 wild cards (which can match anything). Oompa-Loompas are in just four colors: green, red, yellow and blue.&#10;&#10;This simplicity makes the game suitable for Ages 3 and up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "WELLINGTON'S WAR presents the entire Peninsular Campaign using wooden blocks on one 32 inch by 48 inch map. The 12 six-month turns cover 1808 to 1814. The 100 blocks represent the military forces ofGreat Britain, Spain, Portugal, and France.&#10;&#10;Combat involves dice rolling for hits (No CRT or Battle board needed). The Supply and logistic rules are meant to model the Peninsular War adage that: &quot;In Spain large armies starve, and small ones get beaten&quot;. Winter attrition in the wrong areas can be brutal. Control of areas is key to victory and the French player in particular will contend with conflicting needs of garrisoning key areas while maintaining a sufficiently strong field force.&#10;&#10;The map covers Spain, Portugal, and southern France at about 35 miles to the hex. Depicted are the various provinces (rated for political and supply value), the major rivers, mountain ranges, and the key fortresses and towns. Each turn represents 6 months of real time (12 turns in game) and is broken down into Event, Operations, and Administrative phases.&#10;&#10;The wooden blocks represent the major military formations that took part in the war generally depicted as Spanish field armies, French divisional and corp sized formations, Anglo-Portuguese divisions, and British expeditionary forces. Leaders include Wellington, Moore, Soult, and even a special guest appearance by Napoleon himself. Special blocks include Major guerrilla formations, The Lines of Torres Vedras, Popham's Naval Squadron, and key fortress garrisons.&#10;&#10;A set of 30 event cards allows for random events, historical chrome, and political background. They also help regulate the various nation's force levels in the game. A sampling includes: &quot;The Convention of Cintra&quot;, &quot;Supreme Junta&quot;, &quot;The Emperor Strikes Back&quot;, and &quot;Russian&quot;. War. The game also includes 30 operations cards.&#10;&#10;The game has a 12 turn Campaign game scenario, a five turn short game scenario, and a set of optional rules that provide more chrome or can be used to favor one side or the other.&#10;&#10;Go to www.justplain.com for the publisher's website.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to surround the opponent's king wins. This basic version is very close to Isolation. Differences: You add pieces instead of taking them away. The board size is larger (8x8 instead of 6x8). There are fewer pieces (45 instead of 46).&#10;&#10;The advanced version allows a player to escape if there are two pieces of the same colour adjacent to the king.

    "Description": "This was the first in a series of tactical space combat games linked to Galaxy-Foundation Games' strategic Battle for Andromeda: Conflict for a Trillion Suns! series. Further games using the same rules were Duel of the Sun Slayers, Vengeance Crusaders vs. The Monads, and the probably never published Plunderers of the Planets.&#10;&#10;Galaxy-Foundation Games licensed Taurus Games to produce the initial print run of the game (6,000 copies, according to a later GFG catalog). Whether GFG produced any further copies is unknown; at least one later game in the series included a completely rewritten Warriors of the Dark Star rulebook, but no copy of the original game with that rulebook has been seen.&#10;&#10;From the GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):&#10;&#10;&#10;        The Warriors of the Dark Star - in the Age of the Neutron Wars covers the Tactical aspects of the same subjects above, except that the player is concerned with the piloting of ONE ship, its intricate operations, the application of SPECIFIC SECRET WEAPONS, individually applied, ship-to-ship single combat, Tactically oriented Battles, similar to a duel between Battleships, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;        Often &quot;WD&quot; games are issued immediately with a companion &quot;BFA&quot; game; while the BFA game has all the ships in quantity as well as specialized weapons systems, the &quot;WD&quot; series takes in a particular FEATURE emphasized STRATEGICALLY in RFA, and allows a &quot;Close-Up&quot; in-depth treatment of particular ships. Thus, a war involving 20 or 30 ships of which 12 of these units are representative of a Special Dreadnaught with unique capabilities, fighting an ENEMY with ships of unusual properties, is concentrated on. &quot;WD&quot; would concern itself with the broad exposition of these forces in the form of a single ship which would be cast in a series of Scenarios that would reflect the small battles occurring in ONE HEX of &quot;BFA&quot; to give the emotional and personal &quot;FEEL&quot; not of an Admiral of the Fleet, but of a Captain of one vessel, where his piloting skills and crew efficiency is most vital! This does not cover a single bizarre ship in BFA that might be of special use, but of the Main Line items that won or lost the war; the ones that carried the major burden of the battle,   whose over-all effect was sufficient to provide subject matter on what ONE ship would teach players that would help them understand the LARGE view of BFA. It is also a TRAINING AID in teaching Captains in individual combat in WD to become Commanders after the TEST OF BATTLE of fleets in BFA. Of course, if popular demand requires special, and/or additional types exposed in BFA, not covered in WD to be produced, an extension kit to HD for a minor cost of $2 to $4 is printed allowing the ND kit an unlimited number of &quot;Expansion modules&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players are given the option of playing as a Mafia player (Mafioso) or a regular player (Citizen).  Citizens play by the normal Monopoly rules while Mafiosi draw from the Mafia Card deck every time they pass Go.  Mafiosi also have other special rules, such as the ability to grift $50 from the bank every time any player passes Go.  These advantages are somewhat balanced by the innate dangers of the profession: the Mafia Cards may cause a player to fall under investigation by a Federal Grand Jury or fall victim to as assassination attempt.  One of the other Mafioso players may even put out a hit on you!&#10;&#10;There is an interesting optional rule that allows any Mafiosi to cheat, as long as they don't get caught.  If they get caught, they must pay 10% of their holdings to the bank and 10% to the player who blew the whistle.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Monopoly&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each group showcases dogs from that category of the AKC.&#10;&#10;WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: The Best in Show card.  When you play this card you name a card color (red, yellow, blue, or green).  Each player draws a card from the draw deck until he draws a card of the named color.  Once all players have done this the player to your left resumes by playing a card of the named color.&#10;&#10;",
