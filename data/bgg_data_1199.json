It is best if only one side is privy to their mission briefing.&#10;&#10;A Map &ndash; The maps are grid based and most tables are large if you were to play in 28mm.&#10;&#10;Judges notes &ndash; Final Combat works best if you use a games-master and the scenarios are really geared for this. In this section they will find guidelines for running the game, how to keep it tense, when to divulge information etc. But don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t use a. This section includes the &lsquo;Special Scenario rules&rsquo;, which cover a wide range of detail from special movement, artillery incoming, communications, special morale considerations etc.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions &ndash; Sometimes these are specific conditions that need to be met, sometimes they are a point based system.&#10;&#10;",

The higher total wins the battle.&#10;&#10;Nineveh: No Mercy is based on true historical events.  Starting in 626 BC, a series of civil wars have weakened the Assyrian Empire, thus emboldening occupied territories to unite in rebellion to topple the Empire.  In No Mercy, the 22 red point cards represent the Assyrian army (The Wicked City of Nineveh being their capital), and the 33 blue point cards represent the coalition forces of the Babylonians, the Medes and the Persians.  The Assyrian forces are more skilled and valued at 11 points per card, coalition forces are more numerous but less skilled and valued at 7 points per card.  As the Assyrian general you command the 22 red point cards while your opponent commands the 33 blue point cards of the coalition forces.&#10;&#10;There will be a series of 11 battles and the player who wins most of these battles gains a victory point. In each of these 11 battles, the Assyrian general plays 2 red cards against the coalition general&rsquo;s 3 blue cards.  After each conflict consisting of 11 battles, the players switch armies/colors and become the new general of the opposing army.  The 1st player to win 2 victory points wins the War, thus ending the game. In case of a tie, a 3rd conflict is necessary to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;As the Assyrian general, are you skilled enough to defeat the much larger coalition force?  As the coalition general, can you overwhelm the Assyrian forces with your superior numbers?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nineveh: Tug-of-War is a series of 6 card battles in which each player plays 3 cards each.  The higher blue or red total wins!&#10;&#10;Nineveh: Tug-of-War is based on true historical events.  After the death of the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal in 631BC, a series of civil wars ensued between his sons, Prince Ashuretli and Prince Sinshar, in a struggle for control of the throne.  As a top general representing a Prince, the chaos has created your path into power.  In this battle of Tug of War, you must defeat your rival to end the civil war as your prince assumes the throne in Nineveh and rules the Assyrian Empire.&#10;&#10;In this civil war, you will lead both Assyrian forces (red cards) and foreign forces (blue cards) in your attempt to gain control of the empire.  Each player alternates playing offense and defense and can only defeat a city during an offensive attack to gain a victory point.  On defense, you will defend 3 cities sympathetic to your cause, giving you an advantage by getting to pick either red or blue forces to defend with and by also adding reinforcements to bolster your defense. Lose these 3 cities and you lose the civil war.&#10;&#10;The mixed loyalties in this civil war have caused great mistrust between your Assyrian forces (red cards) and your foreign forces (blue cards), causing you to form 2 different armies.  Your Assyrian force has little will to fight rival Assyrian forces.  Your foreign forces also have little will to fight rival foreign forces.  So, when you decide to defend a city with either red or blue cards, your opponent must attack with the opposite colored force.&#10;&#10;Do you have the military expertise necessary to defeat your opponent? Are you savvy enough to trap your opponent into wasting resources and to capitalize on their mistakes, or will you be defeated in this civil war?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Fulfilling a contract will gain you experience.&#10;     Use your experience to attract and befriend Noble's who want to use you for heirloom pieces and who will spread the word about you to their friends, which will earn you the much coveted &quot;Fame&quot;.&#10;     Build up enough &quot;Fame&quot; to take home the prize and become the &quot;Royal Jeweler&quot;!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Game Setup#&#10;     Each player choose a color and collect the 3 worker meeples of that color, then take a work station card and place it in front of them.&#10;     Place the raw material card within reach of all players. Place all gems in their spots.&#10;     Shuffle the Noble cards and place a number equal to 1 plus the number of players to form the top row of the &quot;board&quot;.&#10;     Shuffle the Contract cards, cut the deck in half and flip one side, then shuffle again and deal out 3 contracts face up in rows below each Noble to complete the &quot;board&quot;.&#10;     Begin (Use your chosen method for deciding who takes the first turn).&#10;&#10;&#10;Steps of each turn&#10;Place/Move Workers - to bid on contracts. In this step you will send each of you available workers to bid on a specific contract.  If you have no available workers, you may move 1 worker from an uncontested contract and reassign it to any other contract. (Uncontested means that your worker is the only worker bidding on that contract.  If another player has placed a worker on any contract that your worker is bidding on, it becomes &quot;contested&quot; and neither worker can move until one of the players fulfills the contract)&#10;&#10;Gather Raw Materials - Roll the 3 dice and either collect those 3 raw materials, or sacrifice one of the 3 dice and re-roll the remaining 2 dice.  Then either collect those 2 raw materials or sacrifice 1 dice and re-roll the remaining 1 dice and collect the raw material from the result.  (This indicates you going deeper into the bazaar in search of the perfect gemstone, but often you won't find it and you will never get the best deal)          &#10;Place all raw materials onto your work station in the appropriate space&#10;&#10;The Main Step - During the Main step of your turn you will choose from 1 of 4 potential actions. (Limited to a single action per turn)&#10;&#10;&#10;     Complete a contract - If you have the required raw materials on your work station, you may choose to complete one of the contracts that your worker has bid on.  Once you complete a contract, you will take it and place it under the lower part of your workstation so that only the &quot;Experience&quot; section remains showing (See Action Shot).  Then return any workers that were bidding on the contract back to their owners and replace the contract by dealing one from the &quot;Contract&quot; deck.&#10;     Befriend a Noble - If you have collected enough &quot;Experience&quot; to befriend a Noble, you may do so.  Do so by taking the Noble that you want to befriend and placing it beneath the top portion of your work station so that only the gold star &quot;Fame&quot; symbol is showing (See Action Shot).  Then replace that Noble with one from the top of the &quot;Nobles&quot; deck. If the Noble you befriend adds enough &quot;Fame&quot; for you to win the game, you win as soon as you befriend him/her and the game ends.  (Shuffle up and play again)&#10;     Bribe a Noble - For the low cost of twice the &quot;Fame&quot; rating of a Noble (Payable using any gems or gold from your stockpile), you can bribe them to leave the board and be replaced with the top Noble from the deck.  This tactic comes in very handy if, for instance, you see that your opponent is going to win or close to being able to befriend a Noble that may turn the game to their advantage.  Also good to help clear Nobles that aren't a good fit for the current &quot;board&quot;.&#10;     Pass - Occasionally there is nothing that you can do with your current worker placement or workstation stockpile.  When that happens, you can simply pass and end your turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;Winning the game&#10;Solo Mode - Playing this game solo is a race against the clock!  You will play &quot;Easy, Normal or Hard mode&quot; by trying to reach 3,4 or 5 stars of &quot;Fame&quot; faster than the creator's best score AND before the 12 turn clock ends and you lose the game outright!  Keep track of your personal best scores using the space allotted in the back of the rule book.&#10;&#10;Normal Mode (2-6 Players) - When playing with other people, the goal is to become the most famous jeweler before they do.  The objective will be to reach a level of &quot;Fame&quot; equal to 1 plus the number of players. **EX.**3 players is 1+3=4 stars of &quot;Fame&quot; to win.  The first person to reach the &quot;Fame&quot; amount required wins immediately after befriending the Noble whose &quot;Fame&quot; rating puts them over the top!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players assemble and customize a force of 20&ndash;30 models and fight a scenario-driven battle using dice and cards to control their mighty units and to cast epic cyphers. The game is played using an alternating-activation turn sequence with a round tracker that governs scoring opportunities and the duration of ongoing effects. Players take turns activating units one at a time and using their rack of cyphers, reality-warping spells that can be used to enhance their troops and warjacks or to devastate their opponent&rsquo;s forces.&#10;&#10;While the Warcaster is not physically present on the battlefield, their presence is always felt. A Warcaster coordinates and supports their forces from a sophisticated command and control center called a rack, located aboard a massive battle carrier that transports the Warcaster&rsquo;s troops and warjacks. In the game, the rack is represented by a deck of cards&mdash;the spell-like cyphers&mdash;that players customize prior to the game based on the powers and abilities they wish to wield as a Warcaster.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Hidden Chambers expansion offers 4 mini maps that represent secret rooms. Once you find the door and pick its lock, you may enter the gloomy depths to find treasures, special items, or&mdash;perhaps&mdash;death. These Chamber Boards are set alongside the main game board, denoting a separate floor or level rather than altering an existing room.&#10;&#10;Depths of the Lost Citadel&#10;&#10;As well as offering brand new options for scenario designers, the Hidden Chambers Map Expansion also comes with its own special solo/co-op scenarios and an Adventure Mode scenario for the new Citadel map&mdash;&ldquo;In the Depths of the Lost Citadel&rdquo;. These scenarios require the core/retail version of Conan (or King or Barbarian pledge) and the new Conqueror expansion.&#10;&#10;Players will assume the roles of hired swords with a mission: enter the lost citadel of an ancient sorcerer and steal a fabled artefact. To manage this dangerous feat, they must avoid traps, uncover secret doors, and battle the unspeakable horrors lurking beneath. And even if they manage all this, it is unlikely the sorcerer will let them leave with their lives.&#10;&#10;For solo/co-op mode, this expansion will allow players to add an optional scenario to the campaign offered in the Tome of Skelos.&#10;&#10;-Description by the publisher&#10;&#10;Notes:&#10;&bull; The Depths of the Lost Citadel Adventure Mode scenario is included in the Tome of Skelos (pages 60-62). Two coop-solo Hidden Chambers scenarios are also included in the Tome of Skelos: scenario 3.5, &quot;On the Edge&quot; (pp. 25-26), and 5.5 &quot;Citadel of Horrors&quot; (pp. 33-35).&#10;&bull; This first &quot;Hidden Chamber&quot; offering (2 tiles/4 sides + 8 tokens) was issued in a small cardboard box for the Conan the Conqueror Kickstarter - another Hidden Chamber Tile was added to the later Conan: Red Nails Kickstarter (2025 release) as a stretch goal.&#10;&#10;",

Its stories give players a lot of replayability and modular game map new experiences for each game. Become a leader of a Statera nation or a powerful God, fight for the territory, balance your believers, gather souls, and experience all of Statera's stories.&#10;&#10;You can pick a different story for each game to determine the basic game's setup, get a richer experience, and learn more about the game world's story. By choosing to play for the nations of Statera or their gods you can also select the game's difficulty and the game's length.&#10;&#10;In the Statera you will play as one of the nations of Statera or their God. The game is double-asymmetric. The first asymmetry comes from the difference between Gods and Staterans, second, there is an asymmetry between the factions. Some rules and patterns apply to the whole game, some only for Gods or Staterans, and some rules are specific to the faction.&#10;&#10;The game is story-based. Each story tells a tale from the land of Statera and through that, it defines a number of players, unique victory conditions, setup, and some small rule adjustments. It basically means that each story, when played, feels like a different game.&#10;&#10;The scale rising above the game board is a big part of Statera - the game and the world. The Stories already created for the game, are using the scale to count souls, balance them, lean towards a specific campsite, or take souls away from it. This component is simply crucial to play the game!&#10;&#10;The important question is - Are you a brave Stateran, or a mighty god? It is time to lean the scale in your favor!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
