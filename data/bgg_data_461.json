(Tarkenton was a New York Giant quarterback at the time &ndash; before he led the Vikings to three Super Bowls.)&#10;&#10;The game was advanced for the time, and very much a simulation. The game used 23 offensive basic plays and 8 defensive lines. Unlike some contemporaries and many lesser football games, the proper defense will limit the damage of a great roll. Despite the limited number of offensive plays, there are plenty of choices since the plays can showcase feature positions. Also, beyond the 8 defensive setups, the defensive player can also have the choice of which player to 'key' on. Of course, double-covering the wrong receiver will allow a lesser roll to have a higher result.&#10;&#10;The true advancement for the game system was the yearly 'rating' of each team on their defensive and offensive line in each of these plays. Thus, when you played two teams, there was a die roll modifier for each play based on each defense.&#10;&#10;The clock functions were also very good, allowing a true 'two minute drill' and the use of real game strategies.&#10;&#10;Fran Tarkenton's Pro Football is a great time capsule with a look at the teams in the 1960s, before they merged to become the NFC and AFC.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "4th Street Baseball is a baseball simulation game using individual ratings to recreate big league baseball action.  Ratings are printed in booklet format on perforated cardstock.  They measure 3.5&quot; x 2.5&quot; (the same size as a bubble-gum card).&#10;   The game starts with the pitcher.  Each pitcher is rated for his ability to get the ball over the plate, the likelihood of him giving up the long ball, walk to strikeout ratio, hits allowed, etc.&#10;   Each hitter has been rated for average, extra-base potential, strikeouts and walks, base running, stealing, bunting, and lefty-righty hitting. In addition, pitchers and hitters are rated for defensive range, error frequency, outfielder-catcher arms, and infielders ability to turn the double play.&#10;   Five dice are employed in 4th Street Baseball...one twenty-sided (d20), two ten-sided (d10), and two six-sided (d6). &#10;   Play starts by determining the count.  The two d10 are rolled and the count is determined by looking at the pitcher's count column.  If the pitcher gets ahead in the count, his ratings, along with all of the defensive players behind him, increase.  If he falls behind, then the increase is instead given to the hitter.  The defense is allowed to position its players and selects a strategy card (fastball, breaking ball, pitchout, etc.).  The offense, likewise, selects a strategy card (hit and run, steal, etc.).  All five dice are rolled, the strategy cards are revealed, and the play continues by finding a &quot;matchup&quot; on the pitcher's card.  Matchups vary from balls hit to a specific fielder, to batter-pitcher battles, to ballpark and defensive positioning effects.  Once a matchup has been determined, the defender's rating is subtracted from the hitter's rating and the result is compared to the d20.  If the result is less than or equal to the d20, the hitter wins the matchup and the final result of the play is read off the hitter by adding the two d6 and referring to the appropriate column.  If the d20 result is higher, then the play result is found similarly on the defensive player.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a book (or two books, depending upon the season) full of baseball player ratings which are perforated to 2.5&quot; x 3.5&quot; (the same size as a bubble-gum card), baseball fields (printed on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; card stock, for each team), dice, strategy cards, an easy-to-read results chart, and score sheets.  All players are rated for the 2005 season, except those with less than 25 at bats or innings pitched, or pitchers who had 2 or less starts.&#10;&#10;",

Ten of the squares are entrances to the pool and when the player lands on them they must roll again and follow the path of a swimmer through the water back to the poolside.  The pool sections are similar to the familiar snakes and ladders, with one difference - the paths through the pool are marked out in squares and thus may represent delays as well as the usual short-cuts or backward steps.&#10;&#10;The game appears to consist of only the board, counters and a die to be supplied by the player.  The instructions mention &quot;dice&quot; but it is likely that the game was intended to be played with one die.  Each player must roll &quot;3&quot; to begin and the exact number to finish which might be impossible with a pair of dice.&#10;&#10;The board illustration is quite pleasant, possibly representing an Art Deco swimming pool.  All the swimmers are male, in red or blue trunks.&#10;&#10;Valentine's Games were proud to proclaim the board as &quot;British Manufacture&quot;.  The game is marked as copyright, but this is undated, although the provenance of the game suggests the game to be no later than 1950.  It is marked G12 suggesting that other boards were available from Valentine's Games.&#10;&#10;",

Adventurers collect survival gear, hire guides, deal with natives, and of course, challenge Taetsequama.  To win, they must steal the treasure from the native temple and then return to the start area.  However, once the treasure has been stolen from the temple, other players can steal the treasure by landing on the adventurer carrying it.&#10;&#10;The instructions list three levels of play which add complexity for higher levels.  Some of the challenges involve rolling specific numbers on the dice -- &quot;Snake Eyes must be rolled within 10 tries.&quot;  Some  issues are decided based on the player's life experiences -- &quot;If you've seen 'Dumbo', go to the south elephant walk.  If not, go to the north elephant walk.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
