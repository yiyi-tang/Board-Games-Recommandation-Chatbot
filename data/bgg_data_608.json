On his or her turn, a player spins a spinner which determines what happens with one or two cards that can be drawn. If not, they have to be given to other players. If a card matches the color on the player's waggon, it can be put into a slot on the waggon. The first player to place six passengers into his or her waggon is the winner. The game is Disney themed.&#10;&#10;",

A player may use a variety of characters, each with an unique ability, to travel to new lands, form alliances, and fight duels. This innovative card game uses each part of the card for different plays, even the backs!&#10;&#10;In Conquest the card game, the object is to be the first player to capture the majority of landmarks.  Players are dealt 5 cards.  There are 9 landmarks in the game.  Players can set the length and difficulty of the game at the start by choosing 3, 5, 7, or 9 landmarks or choosing landmarks that are more difficult to reach.  Players move to different landmarks by playing cards from their hand that match the combination of terrain icons on each landmark card.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of one of 15 characters who may travel to different landmarks to try to take possession of them or duel opponent&rsquo;s character.  Players may also form alliances to avoid being attacked with the added bonus of getting the opportunity to secretly buy the allied player&rsquo;s land.  Some of the characters include samurai, pirate, spy, witch, and ninja.  Each character has a unique ability that players can use to gain an advantage.&#10;&#10;Players also control armies and officers that can battle to take over other player&rsquo;s landmarks.&#10;&#10;Conquest is not a CCG.  It is a complete game with a deck of 63 cards, however, because each card can be used in multiple ways, it feels more like a deck of 200.  Each corner on the face of the cards represents a different aspect of the game:  characters, alliances, armies or terrain.  On the back of each card is a mythological beast which is used to resolve duels between characters.&#10;&#10;The game includes 63 cards representing:&#10;&#10;15 characters (including 4 officers)&#10; 3 mythological beasts (dragon, unicorn, minotaur)&#10; 4 alliances  (eagle, elephant, lion, bear)&#10; 4 terrain types (mountains, forest, desert, river)&#10;12 shield markers&#10;27 army cards&#10; 9 landmarks&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tavreli (Russian Chess) is a two-player abstract strategy board game in the same family as Western chess, Shatranj, Japanese Shogi or Chinese Xiangqi.  There was an ancient Russian Chess-like game called Tavreli but its rules have been lost over time. Today's Tavreli is a modern game that was recreated in the latest 1990s as a combination of standard Chess and Bashni (Russian Stacking Draughts).&#10;&#10;There are three main differences between Tavreli and standard Chess:&#10;&#10;- When a player captures an opponent's piece, the captured piece is not taken off the board. Instead of this the player puts his piece on top of the captured piece forming a stack.&#10;&#10;- A player can move his piece to a square occupied by another player's piece. In this case the player puts the moved piece on top of the &quot;captured&quot; one the same way as it happens with opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;- A stack belongs to whoever owns its topmost piece, and moves as that piece does. However, a player is not obliged to move a stack as a whole: it is allowed to move just the top part of it leaving the bottom part on its place.&#10;&#10;The more detailed rules in English: http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/tavreli.html&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This 17th century two-player game uses a standard deck of cards. Each player gets 3, and any card can be played in any turn, the highest one wins the trick. (Ties count for nobody.) A player winning two tricks wins the round and gets a point. The first one to achieve 5 points is the winner. At certain points players can &quot;put&quot;, then opponents can give up or &quot;see&quot; - if opponents choose the latter, then the winner of that round instantly wins the whole game.&#10;&#10;The 19th century version of the game allows players to resign a hand, giving a point to their opponent. It could also be played four-handed, between two pairs of partners.&#10;&#10;Some sources allow three players. In his Penguin Book of Card Games, David Parlett speculates that if all three players win one trick then nothing is scored, and that if one player puts, both of the opponents agree whether to concede or play out.&#10;&#10;",

The die comes with a &quot;playing field&quot; sheet randomly filled with the smileys of the die. On the back of this sheet you can find the rules of two games that can be played with the die. On the website of 999 Games you can find rules for two other games as well. Here follows a short description of the available games with the die:&#10;&#10;Gezichtje Zoeken (Find the Smiley)&#10;&#10;A player rolls the die. Now every player searches the thrown smiley on the playing field. The player that locates the smiley first gets a point. This game can be played until a certain amount of points is reached.&#10;&#10;Bekken Trekken (Make Faces)&#10;&#10;A player rolls the die hidden from the other players. He / she now has to make the face shown on the die. When another player guesses the correct face he / she earns one point and the performer earns two points. At the end of the game the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Dobbel 9 (Roll 9)&#10;&#10;For this game you have to know that the &quot;playing field&quot; is devided in two halfs by a red dotted line and that the faces of the die occur many times on the playing field.&#10;&#10;Both players use their own half of the &quot;playing field&quot; and throw the die in alternate turns. When a player throws the die, he / she has to mark the thrown smiley on the playing field. This way the players try to make a square of 3 * 3 marked smileys. The first player to reach this wins the game.&#10;&#10;DOBBEL Bingo (DOBBEL Bingo)&#10;&#10;DOBBEL Bingo works the same as Dobbel 9 but now you have to try to mark all smileys on your half of the playing field.

The player can then add a piece of any state to the source node.&#10;&#10;There is one exception: the Thrust! In a &quot;Thrust&quot;, a player moves a piece from one node to another. The backfill process on proceeds to the baseline, whereby an empty node is left. In an &quot;Thrust&quot; move, the source node is left unchanged.&#10;&#10;The &quot;states&quot; of the pieces are as follows:&#10;&#10;1) Neutral&#10;2) Create  - adds a peice of Neutral State to the board&#10;3) Change  - changes the state of any of the players pieces to another state&#10;4) Recruit - changes opponent's pieces of State 4 or less to players own piece of Neutral State&#10;5) Eject   - removes opponents piece of State 5 or less&#10;6) Block   - acts as barrier to other states.

They possess armies consisting of skeletons, zombies and black knights. But the bewitched place is not going to surrender their treasures easily. Due to the cavern&rsquo;s sorcery, neither necromancer is able to distinguish his own soldiers: all of them look the same. So if he intends to win the battle, he will have to do it almost blind.&#10;&#10;MATERIAL&#10;&#10;A rectangular 4x5 game board (20 grey spaces).&#10;Six red pieces (monsters) for one necromancer and six black ones for the other. Each set will include one black knight, two zombies and three skeletons. The following symbols will be inscribed on one side of the pieces: a helm for black knights, a zombie&rsquo;s face for zombies and a skull for skeletons.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;At the beginning, the board is empty. Each player (necromancer) chooses one colour and takes the corresponding six pieces (1 black knight, 2 zombies and 3 skeletons). Those pieces will be set face down (symbols hidden). Therefore, the players will not know the identities of the members of their army (until they are required to be displayed).&#10;The board will be oriented so that there is a distance of five spaces between the players.&#10;&#10;MONSTERS AND TEAMS&#10;&#10;Any evil lord knows black knights are more skilled warriors than zombies, and zombies fight better than skeletons. So, when attacking, a black knight will defeat any other opponent; a zombie will beat a skeleton or another zombie but will be beaten by a black knight, and a skeleton will only defeat another skeleton. When attacked, a black knight will only be overcome by another black knight; a zombie will be beaten by a black knight or another zombie and a skeleton will always lose the fight.&#10;A player can decide to take the risk and join forces by forming groups (teams) of two (2-teams) or three (3-teams) pieces (putting one on another). In that case, the cave&rsquo;s magic determines that 2-teams always fight like a zombie and 3-teams always battle like a black knight, whichever the identities of their monsters may be.&#10;&#10;MOVES&#10;&#10;Every piece or team behaves the same way:&#10;-Move: orthogonal to an adjacent (and empty) space.&#10;-Attack: diagonal to an adjacent space occupied by a foe. Defeated pieces are immediately removed from the board and successful attackers take their position.&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;&#10;A player wins when he gets rid of all his opponent&rsquo;s pieces, keeping at least one of his pieces on the board. If the game ends with all the pieces removed, the result is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

That single large die is labeled on 4 sides and also has 2 clear sides that you can see into.  The marked sides show a STRIKE, a BALL, a FOUL Ball and these are in fact the results of the die roll if those sides how up on the roll.&#10;&#10;BUT  If the clear side of this large DIE is rolled you can see inside of the die and what you see are a pair of dice, one colored red, and one colored green. If you can see dice instead of a pitch then what has been rolled on those dice determine the results of the play.&#10;&#10;Also one of the Clear sides also has red dot on it. The results of the dice looking through this side of the clear facing are different than results determined if looking through the clear side without the red dot.&#10;&#10;The results code shows what happens depending on the dice roll and if men are on differing bases.&#10;&#10;Information about this game was gathered and approval given from BUTCH7999 and his BASEBALL GAME SITE.&#10;&#10;",

Each player draws a shape on a sheet, and then they are simultaneously revealed. Now the players take turns rolling a die which determines how many pins can be moved and how the rubber band's position can be changed.

Each player should also be provided with about two dozen of counters, on which a nominal value should be set, that any player who happens to be out, may purchase of the winners. If more than six persons sit down to play, a greater number of markers may be cut out of card, and distinguished by figures, as may be agreed on.&#10;Each player proceeds in the game according to the numbers he spins, and pays the fine, or receives the reward appointed. Advances are made by adding the figure turned to that on which the marker stands. Should any player spin a number on which there is already a marker, he must take its place and the other must move one forward. Any player taking more than his due, must go back as many numbers as he took. If he take too few, and the next player have spun, he must remain where he was.&#10;Whatever fines are marked in the list of numbers, must be put into the pool, and the first who makes exactly 150, or `The Jubilee' wins the game; but if he happens to spin above that number, he must go back as may from 150 as he spun beyond it, till he or some one else wins the pool and its contents. Persons going backward in the game are exempted from the fines attached to the figures on which they be obliged to rest.&#10;&#10;George IV sits at the centre of the game.&#10;&#10;Published May 1st, 1820.&#10;&#10;",
