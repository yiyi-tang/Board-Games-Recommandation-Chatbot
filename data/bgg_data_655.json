Instead of rolling the die to determine how far you move, the roll determines which deck of cards you draw from. The card determines your move, usually by giving you a choice.  For example, here is a card from the &quot;Personal Life&quot; deck: &quot;You suddenly get hit with two paternity suits.  Collect (2) enemychips and move back (3) or pay $2500.&quot;  Here's one from &quot;Connections&quot;: &quot;Your boss' spouse takes a liking to you at a company picnic.  Move up (2) or collect $500 and two friendchips.&quot;&#10;&#10;Most turns you'll have to make a decision as to how to best balance your forward progress with your money, friends, and enemies.  Friend chips are awarded for various &quot;friendly&quot; events, and Enemy chips are earned for all the people you had to step on to raise yourself up.  Friendchips can be turned into $250 each if you can't otherwise make loan payments, or they can be used to move up one extra space.  Enemy chips can be bought off for $500, and you can't enter the CEO's office (and win the game) unless you have more friendchips than enemychips.  You also must enter the CEO's office by exact count, so it helps to have friendchips to adjust you movement as needed.&#10;&#10;In addition, certain squares landed on indicate that a card from the &quot;Outside Influence&quot; deck is drawn.  These cards affect all players.  These events may refer to the department indicated on the board spaces.  The departments are &quot;Sales,&quot; &quot;Accounting,&quot; &quot;Data Processing,&quot; &quot;Manager,&quot; etc.  A card from the Outside Influence deck is: &quot;A new simulator increases the productivity of the Technical Department.  All technical staff move up (3).&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Don't let them catch you or someone may grab a gun, and then the fastest shot decides rather than the best hand.&quot;&#10;&#10;Derringer is a Poker variant where each of the oversized hand card shows one to three Poker cards. Rules follow those of five-card draw Poker, but you have to decide which cards to play. With the 5 hand cards several possible Poker card hands may be built. You play a bid round, a buy round and a second bid round. When it comes to show your hand, you play two hand cards (showing 5 or 6 Poker cards) or as many hand cards as necessary to play exactly 5 Poker cards. Double cards or playing 6 Poker cards counts as card-sharping; in this case other players can decide to play Derringer cards to shoot that player out of this round. Three additional special power cards are in the the deck, allowing special actions.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two editions, &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;Traveller&quot;. Traveller has the minimum equipment, and the bills are smaller und uncut, but it still comes in a veneer-wooden box. Maverick comes in a splendid wooden case, with larger and fully-cut bills and more Poker chips. Summary cards explain the special power cards and the Poker hand values&#10;&#10;",

Expandable to over 40 guests with the main game by adding additional guests to play with the 3 expandable characters.&#10;&#10;MYSTERY SYNOPSIS:&#10;Three weeks ago, the cheery town of Sunnyville was hit hard with a devastating plague that turned the living into horrifying undead zombies. Once the H5N1 zombie virus spread and the zombie population dominated the living within Sunnyville, the zombies staged a revolt and took over the government. The Center for Disease Control, hearing of this epidemic centered in Sunnyville, quarantined the town and the U.S. Government threatened to 'wipe out' the population of zombies to prevent further spreading of this viral nightmare. But the citizens of the newly-formed Zombie Town weren't the stereotypical aggressive zombies portrayed in movies, television and comic books. The citizens of Zombie Town were simply dead and decomposing but still the same as before - upstanding citizens! But with one gruesome exception: the virus gave them an intense craving for living human flesh! Because a mandatory vaccine against the H5N1 zombie virus was given to the human population outside of Zombie Town and the epidemic ceased to exist, human rights activists caught wind of the situation in Sunnyville (aka: Zombie Town) and formed the Save a Zombie Alliance. Millions banded together across the country and persuaded the United States government to sign an unprecedented peace treaty with the zombies. Ashes, the self acclaimed Emperor of Zombie Town, represented the zombies and outlined the truce with the U.S. President. The major clause in the treaty was that zombies would not cross the borders of Zombie Town unless on an approved journey by the U.S. President and they would never hunt living humans for food outside of their borders. Because there were extensive warning signs posted for miles surrounding Zombie Town's borders, there was an addendum in favor of the zombies that if a living human ended up inside the borders of Zombie Town, they were 'fair game' to be hunted, captured and on a zombie's dinner table. Ashes set forth the laws of Zombie Town and the treaty was to be signed by both Ashes and the U.S. President within 24 hours. The citizens were happy to be at peace with the United States Government. Thankfully, they discovered they could sustain themselves by eating pumpkins but pumpkins didn&rsquo;t quite satisfy their appetite for living human flesh. Suppressing their cravings led to increasing irritability and with frustrations escalating in Zombie Town, Ashes knew s/he had to pump up the morale of the citizens. Leary of an impending civil unrest, s/he scheduled the Undead Festival which was a massive town-wide celebration with delicious pumpkin-inspired food, rockin' music and fun zombie games. And this is where the story begins...&#10;&#10;",

This game can be played as Co-Ed, all Female, or all male with one required female player.&#10;&#10;The cast members of the Chamber of Screams Haunted House worked really hard this Halloween season scaring the people of the town. The management of the Chamber of Screams decided to reward the employees with a mini-Halloween celebration held during normal business hours in the employee break room. The Haunted House typically shut down each night for a brief time period so the employees could get a break and straighten up their haunted scenes. It was rumored that management probably did this so the line of customers outside would build up and The Chamber of Screams would look twice as popular. Regardless of the reason for the break, the employees looked forward to the upcoming treat during their next shift at work. The Halloween Celebration kicked off without a hitch as the frightening cast members piled into the employee break area and enjoyed delicious creepy appetizers and eerie drinks while quizzing each other on challenging spooky trivia. Unexpectedly, the lights went out and within a few minutes...to everyone's horror...a dead body was discovered!&#10;&#10;The employees scrambled to figure out whodunit before the police arrived.&#10;&#10;--from the publishers website&#10;&#10;",

This is an extremely light-hearted and comical murder mystery for great family fun on Thanksgiving.&#10;&#10;MYSTERY SYNOPSIS:&#10;Hannah Standish sent the announcements for her annual Thanksgiving feast to the Pilgrims of Plymouth Village and the Native Americans of the Wompang tribe. The day of the feast arrived and the hungry guests flocked to the Standish home with their hands full of tasty dishes to be shared by all. The guests quizzed each other with fun trivia while nibbling on delectable appetizers. To everyone's surprise, representatives from a neighboring flock of wild turkeys also arrived on the scene to befriend the Pilgrims and Native Americans in hopes to stop the growing tradition of roasting a turkey on Thanksgiving Day. The turkey representatives gave it their best shot and pleaded with the humans to make a switch of the traditional Thanksgiving feast to cow, pig or maybe even fish as the main course. After the humans listened to the wild turkey&rsquo;s pleas, they decided to give the turkeys 'temporary immunity' while they engaged in a fun game of 'What Thanksgiving Thing am I.' They continued with the challenging 'Football Mascot Challenge' before settling in for a nice Thanksgiving Dinner. But before they could dig into the Thanksgiving feast, a victim was discovered in the adjacent room! Murder on Thanksgiving?! Disastrous! The group rallied together to investigate whodunit before the murderer could get away! They took a quick break from the stress of the investigation and played some awesome games such as the 'Thanksgiving Scramble Challenge', 'Thanksgiving Bingo' and the hilarious 'So You Wanna Make a Turkey' challenge. Then, the guests one by one accused who they believed the murderer was and then to everyone's shock...the murderer confessed! The guests capped off the investigation with a hilarious game of 'Thanksgiving Charades' followed by a challenging 'Thanksgiving Word Hunt' game and then settled in for a delectable Thanksgiving feast! Overall it was most definitely a Thanksgiving that everyone will remember for years to come!&#10;&#10;",

Players learn to recognise geometrical forms, colors and their relationships and use the acquired skills in the game.&#10;&#10;The game consists of four tournament rounds. During the first tournament there is one battle, in the second tournament two battles and so on. In total there are 1+2+3+4=10 battles from which players are trying to gather as many points as possible.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is based around knight cards and battle cards. The battle cards give 1-2 pieces of information, for example heraldic animal and color. They're also worth points. The knight cards each have some info that corresponds to a number of battle cards. During a battle a battle card is first turned face up. Players can then participate in the battle with any knight cards that have any matching information to the battle card. These are played by a blind bidding mechanism. There are also some force cards that add to the total power of your knight cards. The player that plays the highest total power of knight cards wins the battle and claims the battle card. Only after the end of the tournament the players get to replenish their hands with new cards.&#10;&#10;",

The players each start on a branch of the cross by laying out 6 checkers and one horsemen (these 7 pieces are their knights) in the squares of the grid of their branch and their king's space. A player's turn consists of (1)drawing a card, (2)dueling another player's knight (optional), (3)turning in any pairs of cards you may have for more knights, and (4) moving any one knight to either an adjacent space or any available green space on the board, one of which allows a player to draw an extra card on their turn.&#10;&#10;When a player starts a duel with another player, they each select a card from their hand, and higher card wins (king is high).  Ties are draws and both cards are discarded.  Re-dueling is optional. The winner draws a card from the draw pile AND takes both cards used in the duel (placed in 'pair's pile'), and loser removes their knight from the board.&#10;&#10;Certain spaces on the board have numbers on them which require the attacker to play a card of that value or higher, while the defender may play any card value. Jokers may be played at any time to steal a random card from an opponent's hand.&#10;&#10;After dueling, if you have any pairs (from either your hand or your 'pair's pile' ) you may turn as many as you wish in for more knights which are then placed in any space adjacent to another of your own knights.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to have your knights occupying all four king spaces on the board.  You must always occupy at least one king space on the board, but not necessarily the one you started with.  If a person loses a duel for their last king space, all of their knights are removed from the board, and their cards are given to the winner of the duel.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NOTE: Only those who own Munchkin games dated before April 2010 need to purchase this set. Games dated on/after April 2010 already include the cards from Munchkin: Go Up a Level.&#10;&#10;After The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover, the publisher didn't want to alienate its existing customer base by making them repurchase Munchkin games they already owned. So they released Munchkin: Go Up a Level, which contains just the changed cards.&#10;&#10;Most, but not all of the updated cards are included. Significant exclusions are as follows:&#10;&#10;    No monster enhancers were included even though they all changed.&#10;    Only one Wandering Monster card was included, even though they all changed.&#10;    Siege Engine from Munchkin 2: Unnatural Axe.&#10;    Curse! Exploding Kneecaps from Munchkin 3: Clerical Errors.&#10;    Grow Two Feet from Munchkin 5: De-Ranged&#10;    Dungeon of Comprehensive Curses from Munchkin 6: Demented Dungeons.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Publisher's Blurb (from the back of the box)Munchkin came out in 2001. Since then, we've published eight more core games and over a dozen expansion sets. We've learned a lot in the last nine years, and new printings of Munchkin and its sequels will change some cards for clarity or balance.&#10;&#10;But we don't expect our fans to buy their Munchkin collection all over again. Instead, we created Munchkin: Go Up a Level. This box contains 132 updated cards from:&#10;&#10;     Munchkin, Munchkin 2, Munchkin 3, Munchkin 4, Munchkin 5, and Munchkin 7&#10;     Munchkin Blender&#10;     Star Munchkin and Star Munchkin 2&#10;     Munchkin Fu and Munchkin Fu 2&#10;     Munchkin Bites! and Munchkin Bites! 2&#10;     Super Munchkin and Super Munchkin 2&#10;     Munchkin Impossible&#10;     Munchkin Cthulhu, Munchkin Cthulhu 2, and Munchkin Cthulhu 3&#10;     The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;     Munchkin Booty and Munchkin Booty 2&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series&#10;&#10;",

S/he continues turning over cards and adding penguins to the count until either a counting mistake is made or a Mother penguin card is turned up, at which point the player keeps all the cards turned up so far and play passes to the next player.  The player with the most cards when the draw deck is exhausted wins.&#10;&#10;No More Penguins!: Each player starts with 5 cards. The top card of the deck is turned face up and players take turns playing a card that matches either the number of penguins or the color of scarf on the face up card. Anyone unable to play from their hand draws cards until a match is found.  The first person to play all their cards wins.&#10;&#10;Penguin Memory: Cards are placed face down in a 4 x 10 matrix.  The player turns over any 2 cards. If the cards make a run (e.g., 2 &amp; 3 penguins or 4 &amp; 5 penguins), another card may be turned over.  The player continues to turn cards face up until one is found that does not continue the sequence. The player keeps the cards that formed the sequence and the next player takes his/her turn.

In Lost Legacy you build a custom deck of 50 cards from a selection of character, item, counter, equipment, environment, weapon, and spell cards to challenge your opponent(s) on a modular game board.  The game incorporates elements from both CCGs and miniatures games (character cards are actually moved around the game board).  The object of the game is to acquire the most honor, honor can be acquired by destroying an opponents character during an attack, your opponent running out of cards in their deck, and having a character at certain locations on the game board.&#10;&#10;Blurb from publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Lost Legacy is a card game made by a small family owned company called Dreamastermind, Inc. located in Illinois.  It is a very strategic game designed to challenge players, but not their wallets.  In most card games, players must purchase multiple booster packs to acquire a couple random cards.  In Lost Legacy, players need only purchase one Expansion Set to acquire every card from that set!  This allows anyone to easily pick up on the game and build any deck they want without breaking the bank.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to climb your way back out, but you will never make it without a long streak of lucky rolls. Anywhere you step, there is some kind of hazard that takes a health point away, or kills you instantly. It might be flying arrows, falling rocks, spikes, or a slide that sends you to a volcanic fire. You start with three health points but you can raise it if you find it too difficult. It doesn't matter anyways because so many spaces are instant death. It's not a linear game, you can't just go straight to the exit. First you have to get a talisman but before you get the talisman you need to get a key.&#10;&#10;{Source: Deadly Danger Dungeon Video Review by James Rofle/Board James}&#10;&#10;",

The race dice have numbers of lengths (also &lsquo;necks&rsquo; which are worth a quarter length). The hazard die has hazards which subtract lengths or may even disqualify a player (e.g.  &lsquo;lost whip&rsquo;, &lsquo;fall/object&rsquo;). The player with the highest number of lengths when the race is completed wins.&#10;The game comes in a pocket book-sized container with a scoring pad and pencil.&#10;&#10;",

They receive bonus points for dice combinations, completing a toy that their department specializes in (the same suit as their score sheet), and for completing the toy that their department makes all the time (a specific card).&#10;&#10;It's a family game for 1 or more players and available free as a print and play game.&#10;&#10;Who will become the Great Garbanzo and earn the most Favor?

After rolling the first die, that player decides how much to bet and subsequently decides whether to roll more dice, one by one, attempting to come as close to a total of twenty-one but not exceeding it. If he exceeds twenty-one the banker takes the player's stake, but if he stops below twenty-one, the banker then rolls two dice and attempts to beat or equal the player's roll. If the banker fails to equal the roll or goes bust, the player wins the appropriate amount as indicated on the cards.&#10;&#10;Optionally, the players may play with side bets. For this purpose, the other cards showing card faces are laid out and players may bet on these faces appearing on the dice for each roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;The instructions mention that other games in the Jackpot Dice series include Clipper, Crown and Anchor, Liar and Crossword Dice.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After 3000 years of restless retirement, batty old elf Willy McWindup is suddenly called in to perform Head Elf duties amidst a wild case of snowball fever sending all of Santa's remaining Head Elves to bed rest.  With mere days before Christmas Eve and piles of presents yet to construct, you must reign in old Willy's outrageous ideas and convince him to green light and produce your concepts to help save christmas.&#10;&#10;&#10;Santa's Workshop Disaster is a quick family holiday themed card game for 2-6 Players, the more the merrier!  It plays similar to Apples to Apples, using funny and disgusting combinations of IDEA and CONCEPT Cards, which together represent a finished present yet to be constructed. Taking turns playing the Head Elf, you draw an IDEA card and (reading aloud) present it on the table.  Helper Elves (the remaining players) then choose a CONCEPT card that they feel best matches the IDEA card.  Receiving the cards face down, the Head Elf then shuffles and (reading aloud) presents the CONCEPTS on the table.  Using ANY criteria, the Head Elf then chooses which Combination of IDEA and CONCEPT to green light and send to production - thus scoring one point towards the win for the player whose CONCEPT was chosen.  Roles then rotate around the table until there is a winner with the most CONCEPTS chosen (rules vary based on number of players).  &#10;&#10;&#10;Santa's Workshop Disaster is a Free Print and Play designed by Monster Make.108 Cards, all files provided in High Resolution, including Rules and Tuck Box.&#10;&#10;Currently files can be found HERE.&#10;&#10;It is a large file (240MB) consisting of 14 pages of 8.5x11 (Letter) Cards with 9 cards to a page.  It also contains 1 page of 8.5x11 PocketMod layout Rules, and 2 pages of 8.5x14 (Legal) Tuckbox layouts. &#10; The files will eventually be loaded into the Database, but for now can be found at the above link!&#10;&#10;Included is alternate rules for 2 players with the addition of A,B,C cards and a version for young (3+ years) players.&#10;&#10;&#10;Thanks, hope you enjoy!!&#10;Stephen - Monster Make",

In Disassemblin' Dice, players build dice using Nestortiles, roll those dice to score points, and then disassemble and re-assemble the dice in order to create more powerful dice.  Rolling a higher score than the other players allows a player to push their opponents' dice markers towards the end of the disassembly track.  Once a player is knocked off the track, their die is disassembled, and they are out of the game.  The last player to have their die disassembled wins.&#10;&#10;Each tile that a player uses to assemble their dice changes the score that any roll yields.  Players must carefully remove and add different tiles to their dice in order to maximize their chances of scoring higher than their opponents.

These Cards are kept hidden. &#10;Each Player has a set of cards, allowing him to move various characters up and down the tree. The goal is to collect the most valuable coconuts with the own characters without being identified by the others, what would enable them to play negative cards on the right target. The player who's characters have collected the most valuable coconuts at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An asymmetric strategy game based on Britain&rsquo;s answer to the West Virginia Mothman sightings. The game can be played using pieces from a chess and checkers set.  Owlman is an abstract strategy game with unequal forces, based on a loose theme of cryptozoological investigation.&#10;&#10;The Owlman side has just one piece (a black knight) which starts in the upper left corner. Doc's side has Doc (a white king starting in the lower right corner) and 12 helpers (checkers starting near Doc).&#10;&#10;Owlman's main objective is to frighten all of Doc's helpers out of the woods. Doc aims to reach the Owlman's lair (the upper left corner), along with one of his helpers (adjacent to the corner), who will help him set up his &quot;cryptozoological&quot; camera.&#10;&#10;The game is played in alternating turns, moving pieces on the 8x8 board. All pieces can step to an adjacent space. Only Owlman can capture, by stepping toward a helper, who is then frightened out of the woods. Owlman also has a special &quot;swoop&quot; move (like an elongated knight's move, but 4x2 instead of 3x2).&#10;&#10;",

In this game players are young helpers arriving to the monastery to learn about the life of Benedictine monks. This can be done by completing tasks (that ask players to collect sets of cards like writing materials, sentences etc.). Board presents a clock with main activities of the monastery (like prayers, work in the scriptorium or in the garden) and players can can choose in which of the shortly starting activities they want to participate (represented by them moving pawn on board). Next the player can use the ability of the field he moved to (drawing card, exchanging card with a common poll, completing tasks etc.). Each completed task gives a player certain amount of points and allows him or her to draw another task card. Game follows this pattern until one of the players collect enough points.&#10;&#10;Game presents Christian spirituality and sentences of st. Benedictine. &quot;Skryptorium&quot; was prepared in cooperation with Benedictine monastery in Tyniec, Poland&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Perfect Captain website:&#10;&#10;The first in our series of Spare Change games, Villehardouin is a campaign game of the Byzantine Reconquest of the Morea in southern Greece in the year 1263 AD.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of either the Achaean Franks under Prince William de Villehardouin, freshly back from captivity in Constantinople, or that of the Byzantine Empire under the Sebastocrator Constantine (the Emperor Michael VIII's step-brother).&#10;&#10;As with all of our games, supply and logistics are as important as naked force. Never fear- there is of course no bookkeeping. At the start of each turn players figure out how much &quot;change&quot; they gather to fuel their activities for the turn. Simply marching off into arid and barren territory, even if it is strategically important, will leave you high and dry and out of supply- forcing a humiliating retreat. Players must plan carefully where they are going, how long they will be there, and what can go wrong; losing a battle will deplete your treasury as well as your army.&#10;&#10;The opposing armies are different too, adding another element to strategy. The Franks have excellent cavalry and good foot troops, but not many skirmishers. The Greeks have an abundance of archers and ambushers as well as hard fighting regulars, and a corps of Turkish mercenaries (of dubious loyalty..). Both sides have to pick their battlefields and their timing must be near-perfect to pull off a game-winning battle.&#10;&#10;The terrain is not the friendliest; each players base is green and lush, but you can't win by sitting still. Feint and counter-feint will be the order of the day, but when the time comes, you must strike. Sieges can be long, but sudden assaults costly. Greeks can set up ambushes while the Franks can attempt impetuous charges- either one can, if handled properly, bring about your opponent's overthrow.&#10;&#10;This is the kind of game where there can be no wasted moves; everything is important, and dilly-dallying will hurt you sooner rather than later. This is a game that will lead to taut nerves and a lot of beard stroking!&#10;&#10;Does it take long to play?&#10;That's entirely up to you. You could easily fly through it in an hour, but if you want to win you'll need to think things through very carefully. Still, it's one of our quickest-play games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Social(c) is the game of social interaction! While working together, construct a question that someone must answer. Each player gets a hand full of cards with a single word on them. As the turns go around the table, each player plays a single word. Once the question is complete, someone must answer the question. Will it be you? The question being asked is both uniquely your choice and the choices of others. Be careful though, you might be the one that must answer! Earn points based upon the words chosen in your sentence. After the question is answered, the real fun begins. Participate in mini-games that include everything from storytelling, acting, dance offs, trivia challenges, a game of craps, or a stare off. Each expansion comes with its own twists and challenges!&#10;&#10;Social comes in several different flavors, each to meet the needs and interests of the gamer. Unlike most modular expandable games, Social does not require all previous expansions to be able to play the game. A single base kit is required along with any number of expansions to create a personalized deck of cards. Some base kits come with expansions. The purpose is to provide new gamers with popular expansions for cheaper pricing and an enhanced level of customizations to decks.&#10;&#10;Additional expansions are able to be purchased separately.&#10;&#10;The white label expansion includes the very basic set of Social.&#10;&#10;Included within this tasty morsel are 189 playing cards that are sure to keep even the most loquacious gamers busy. 2-4 players. Ribbon, box, and cards included. A great starter set for any Socialite!&#10;&#10;Source of information (Company website, Social Flyer, and Instructions).&#10;&#10;",
