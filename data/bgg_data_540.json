    "Description": "Opulent Chess is a chess variant similar to Christian Freeling's Grand Chess, but with an improved  Knight, and two new jumping pieces (the Lion, and the Wizard.) The game is played on a 10&times;10 board&#10;&#10;The Knight moves like a standard Chess Knight, with the added ability to step a single space horizontally or vertically. The Knight is still forced to move to a square of the opposite color with each move.&#10;&#10;The Wizard piece is a color-bound leaper invented for Omega Chess. It can make a (1, 3) leap, or move a single space diagonally. Like a Bishop, the Wizard remains on squares of the same color throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The Lion is a piece invented by Ralph Betza, which he called a Half-Duck. It has been used recently with the name 'Lion' in games by David Paulowich. This piece may leap either 2 or 3 squares horizontally or vertically, or may step a single space diagonally. This piece stays on squares of the same color except when it makes the somewhat awkward (0, 3) leap.&#10;&#10;The Chancellor is a compound piece combining the moves of the Rook and the Orthodox Chess Knight. The Archbishop is a compound piece combining the moves of the Bishop and the Orthodox Chess Knight .&#10;&#10;This material was gleaned from www.chessvariants.com&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Three player chess on a hexagonal board with two colors of hexagonal spaces (black and white).&#10;&#10;There are six bishops (one per color for each player). The pieces have normal starting positions. The standard plastic chess pieces are ivory white, black and gold. There are eight pawns each.&#10;&#10;Movement is somewhat complicated:&#10;&#10;     The king and rook can move in 6 directions - onto adjacent hexes that share a side.&#10;     The &quot;diagonal&quot; moves of the queen and bishop involve skipping over the two adjacent hexes of the other colours onto the hex beyond of the same colour. The bishop can thus move in 6 directions, the queen in 12.&#10;     The knight can also moves onto 12 possible hexes - it moves two hexes forward and one to the side, always onto adjacent hexes that share a side.&#10;     The pawn moves one diagonal hex forward and captures moving two adjacent hexes forward (these are the two hexes on either side of the one it could move to).&#10;&#10;&#10;There are a few other special rules to deal with castling, pawn promotion and whether a diagonal move can pass between two occupied hexes.&#10;&#10;Note that despite the identical name and designer, this game is not identical to Tri-Chess from 1975.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Divide and Conquer is an abstract strategy board game for 2-4 players. As the Commander of a battalion of troops, you plan out and execute troop movements to secure objective regions around the game board. Your opponent&rsquo;s competing troops will cause you to tangle and engage in conflict taking on causalities and slowing your pace to victory. You must anticipate the other players&rsquo; strategies by moving with precision and seizing the initiative. Sometimes your position is defensive to block an opponent from an objective and other times you are invading occupied regions to weaken the offensive of another player.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are based in mathematics and game theory, which provides an additional opponent. If you plan optimally, you will not only defeat the other players, but you will also solve the game with a minimal number of movements.&#10;&#10;Divide and Conquer is played with 2-4 players of all ages with play lasting 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.divideandconquergame.com&#10;&#10;",

To become rule of the realm you must have the backing of the most influential powers in the land, but you should also have support form the Otherworld. There is one way to become the undisputed ruler of the realm, and that is to recover a legendary crown that once belonged to the most powerful rule to have ever ruled the land.

    "Description": "Time Twist is a print and play game of plotting, stealing and time travel, for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;Sunday, November 5th 1899&#10;&#10;&ldquo;When their father, an eccentric scientist, passed away, the four brothers were eager to find out which of them would inherit the family heirloom; a rare collection of antique coins. They were disappointed to discover that their father, knowing how much they all enjoyed games, planned to have his servants hide the coins around the house for a bizarre family treasure hunt.&#10;On Saturday morning the servants hid the antique coins in various locations around the mansion and then the four sons spent the day searching every nook and cranny, desperate to be the one to find the most coins.&#10;By Saturday night one of the sons, much to the annoyance his brothers, had won the game and, having found the most coins, gained a considerable inheritance.&#10;&#10;Desperate to get their hands on the inheritance, each of the brothers had the same idea; use their time machines to change the outcome of the game. Based on their father&rsquo;s prototype, their small time travel devices could enable them to travel back no further than a couple of days. Even the winner of the contest, suspicious of his scheming brothers, realised that he should also travel back to make sure that he was still victorious.&#10;&#10;The plan was to ask the servants where the coins had been hidden, as it was now Sunday they would be happy to divulge that information. Armed with this knowledge the brothers would then travel back to Saturday morning and claim a coin from its hiding place.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Taking on the role of one of the brothers, you will gain a clue card and then travel back to Saturday to claim a coin. You will have to then return to Sunday to acquire another clue card.&#10;Other players can use game cards to steal coins from you. Stealing can be blocked by using a trap (a Time Twist) which you set up on Friday &ndash; you must of course remember to travel back to Friday to set that trap up or it will never happen!&#10;Avoid being lost in space and time as you manipulate time and use every low down trick you can think of to claim your rightful inheritance.&#10;&#10;The necessary game files can be purchased from http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=739&amp;pics=&#10; Players will need to provide a 6 sided die, 14 plastic stands (these are optional).&#10;&#10;",
