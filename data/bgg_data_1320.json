The Klegg are utterly ruthless in the art of war; surrender is futile as prisoners are not taken &ndash; they are eaten!&#10;&#10;The Klegg first roamed the streets of the &lsquo;Big Meg&rsquo; during the corrupt reign of Judge Cal. So feared were these vicious extra-terrestrial carnivores that Dredd&rsquo;s victorious Judges attempted to exterminate every last Klegg in the city.&#10;&#10;Despite this, the Klegg are born survivors and small groups can still be found deep in the ruins and slum blocks, ready to fight just for the pleasure of killing or selling their skills to any underworld maniac prepared to pay them in fresh meat!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Among her many titles and aliases, one stands out in particular: The Lady of Space and Time. Thanks to the Elder Blood running through her veins, Ciri holds the ability to travel between realms, across different periods of time. This got us thinking that perhaps Ciri could have traveled all the way back to the Old World, joining other witchers in the hunt!&#10;&#10;A miniature and a full set of character components. We imagined that it was possible for her to travel to the Old World and have an adventure there.

    "Description": "Moku Tower&rsquo;s gaming concept originates from our previous product &ndash; Woodas. The theme of Moku Tower is to integrate wood art into tabletop game. It is an unconventional idea that transforms wood art into an artistic, interactive and strategic tabletop game that can be played with a group of friends and/or family members. Moku Tower combines the concept of &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;stacking&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot; into one single game. It allows you to casually mess round, laugh and interact closely with your cool friends.&#10;&#10;Moku Tower is not only a great party game, it is also an amazing home decoration that can impress your friends. When you are not playing, you can simply display Moku Tower as an art piece. Each game contains 10 different pieces of wooden rocks (includes both big and small) and are made of 8 different types of natural wood material (ash, pine, sapele, maple, walnut, birch, camphor and rosewood). Each of them has different grain, color, weight, texture and even aroma. Also, each piece of wood is exquisitely handcrafted by our wood master. Hence, each of them has its own unique cutting and angle, making Moku Tower one of your most exquisite and unique home decoration.&#10;&#10;In respect of the gameplay, in order to win in Moku Tower, you need to be good at timing, stacking and strategy. Within the time limit from the hourglass, players need to stack the wooden rocks to gain points based on the requirements that they draw from the cards. Throughout the stacking process, your opponents can attack you using their &quot;Function cards&quot;. Make good use of the Function cards! It can be the turning point for the whole story. The player who first reaches the accumulative target point wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

These objectives must be completed by the end of the eighth round in order for players to be victorious.&#10;&#10;Journey's Edge features strictly strategic gameplay, with hardly any luck (or dice). At each player's disposal is a deck of action cards that are used to move their character across the board to gather food, wood, stone, and fur, which can then be spent to create items like clothing and shelter. They must manage these limited resources carefully and work together as a team to determine the best course of action. To succeed, no one can be left behind.&#10;&#10;Discover enchanted locations. Gather valuable resources. Craft useful tools and weapons. Encounter deadly creatures and monsters, and uncover magical artifacts that will assist you in your quest at Journey's Edge.

If they successfully &quot;mix&quot; colors (e.g., by rolling a yellow + blue to create green), the player wins all green cards in their palette and the jackpot. If the player wagered green cards on their turn, they also win the green cards in the other players' palettes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Disparity Trap: The Socially Conscious Board Game is a game where player can learn how race as a system impacts those of us who live within the United States. Disparity Trap can bring conversations about race to effective levels whether played at home with friends and family, in professional settings, or in junior high through college-level classrooms.&#10;&#10;The game play is like many of its kind, where your individual goal is to accrue as much wealth as possible. But where it differs is that you can play competitvely or cooperatively where you work with your fellow players to dismantle the Disparity Traps seeking to keep everyone in poverty. Within this game you also step into someone else&rsquo;s shoes; to experience the disparities within an identity different from your own. Throughout the game, the dice roll correlates your identity in the game to real life statistics. So like life, the dice are in your &ldquo;hands,&rdquo; but the odds are not.&#10;&#10;In the competitive version, the first play around the board wins.  In the cooperative version, all players must make it to Tier 3 and obtain 3 or more wealth tiles.  If, however, any 2 players are separated by more than 1 tier, the game is lost.&#10;&#10;A print-n-play workbook is available for educators and cards have QR codes for more learning opportunities.  A simplified version of the rules was released in 2024.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The United Sol Colonies, or U.S.C. for short (who this expansion is focused on), are doing their part to bring structure (or structures =P) to the system. They are currently building a network of space stations that all Replicants may have access to, provided they follow a few simple rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;     No fighting on the space stations.&#10;     Use the rooms you need to and move on, so others may use them too.&#10;     Help build additions to the stations you visit.&#10;     Everyone must spend their own resources to activate functions they wish to use.&#10;     Stay out of other hives&rsquo; lockers.&#10;&#10;&#10;In the U.S.C. Expansion you will pick your favorite hive and join the effort to make the system a better place for all Replicants.&#10;&#10;Game play, for the most part, is similar to the core game (which is required to play the expansion.)&#10;&#10;Like in the core game, you will deal out a resource grid each round, and place your drones to collect resources. But between those two phases, you now have a Station phase. During the Station phase, you will get to move your two personnel around the station to access the functions of the different rooms. Room functions consist of things like: build new rooms, resource discounts when leveling up new replicants, buying points, and more.&#10;&#10;After the Drone phase, you still spend the resources you produced or gained to level up your Replicants. However, instead of discarding any unused resources from your hand at the end of the round, you now send them off to your locker on the space station. Once resources are in your locker, you may not use them for leveling up your replicants, but they can be used for activating any functions on the station.&#10;&#10;",

The sky is orange and dense with thick clouds, through which a faint Sun barely shines. A vast, greenish, muddy ocean covers almost the entire planet. The little dry land is black volcanic rocks and barren. But deep in the ocean and in a few oases, something is cooking: life is about to emerge.&#10;&#10;In AEON, you and your friends represent prebiotic environments where Life might have emerged.

Each player also receives the limited funds they will use to collect those items. Each round of the game, players will silently bid on the items available with the goal of collecting their three items, while preventing their opponents from collecting the items they need. Each player also has one Sabotage they can use each game, which destroys an item as well as any bids placed on the item. The first player to collect all three of their items wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Every time a soldier promotes it grows - first into a 2-stack, then a 3-stack, and so on.&#10;&#10;The central idea of Seesaw is the 2-fold significance of stack-size: &#10;(i) Odd-sized stacks move forwards and even-sized stacks move backwards, and &#10;(ii) on any given turn, a stack can take as many steps as it likes from 1 up to its size.&#10;&#10;This results in soldiers seesawing up and down the board as their strength increases to the point where the game is forced to conclude in one side completely eliminating the other.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;On your turn, you must either move a stack, or place a new stack.&#10;&#10;1. Placing a new stack: &#10;A newly placed stack will always be of size 1. You may only place a stack on an empty cell next to a cell with a tile of your color. These cells are promotion cells, and each time you place a new stack you first place a tile of your color on that cell. A cell with a tile on it is not considered empty, but tiles never count toward stacks-size.&#10;&#10;2. Moving a stack:&#10;You only ever move one stack per turn, but that stack may be able to move several steps or capture several enemy stacks, depending on its size.&#10;The number of steps a stack may take is the number of pieces in it, i.e. its size. A stack may never step onto a cell containing a stack of its color.&#10;&#10;2.1 Noncapturing moves: On turns where you do not have to capture an enemy (see below) all the steps a stack takes is either constrained to the 3 upward directions (&quot;forwards&quot;) or to the 3 downward directions (&quot;backwards&quot;), depending on the parity of the size of the stack. Up and down have their standard meanings for games where players sit on opposite sides of a board, like in Draughts and Chess.&#10;&#10;2.2 Capturing moves: If one or more of your stacks can reach an enemy by lifting the restraint on direction, you must capture such a reachable enemy by replacement. If that stack did not spend all its steps reaching the captured enemy, you can, before you end your turn, spend the left-over steps by making a noncapturing move. However, if yet an enemy is in range immediately after you have captured (counting only the steps left over), you must capture again.&#10;&#10;3. Promoting: Your odd-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to your opponent at the end of your turn. Your even-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to you at the end of your turn. When a stack promotes, you add 1 piece to it.&#10;&#10;The object of Seesaw is to capture all your opponent's soldiers. More precisely: If, at the end of your turn, your opponent has no stacks on the board, you have won the game.&#10;&#10;",

It is played with a deck of cards containing 5 suits of 15 numbers each.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Shuffle the deck and fan out 25 stacks of 3 cards each in a regular layout of 5 rows and 5 columns. All cards should be visible, and it should be clear which cards are on which layer of the layout. (The 25 top cards in the initial position are on the top layer, and underneath that there are two more layers of 25 cards each.)&#10;&#10;Definitions:&#10;Every card belongs in a number group together with all and only those cards which are connected to it by a sequence of orthogonal steps between cards with equal numbers. The members of a group all lie on the same layer.&#10;A suit group is defined the same way, except &quot;number&quot; is replaced with &quot;suit&quot;.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;On your turn, you first distribute a number group, then you collect a suit group.&#10;&#10;Distribute: Pick up a number group from the current top layer and distribute them anew on the layout. You may not place two of these cards in the same stack, and you may not place them underneath any cards. Other than that, you are free to choose any of the 25 sites in the layout. There is no limit on how many cards there can be at each site.&#10;&#10;Collect: Pick up any suit group from the current top layer and store those cards in a personal scoring pile on your side of the board.&#10;&#10;Ending the game:&#10;When all cards are collected, the winner is the player whose scoring pile contains the majority of the cards in the majority of the suits.&#10;&#10;Slight variations: &#10;&#10;     Add the requirement that all cards (or at least one card) in the chosen number group are in a new position after distributing.&#10;     When distributing, cards must be moved in a straight (diagonal or orthogonal) line.&#10;&#10;&#10;Decks you can play Garner with:&#10;Rage&#10;Stick 'Em&#10;5&deg;Dimension Playing Card Game&#10;Sluff Off!&#10;Tricky Bid&#10;David &amp; Goliath&#10;&#10;Ways of playing with more traditional decks:&#10;&#10;(A) &#10;&#10;     9 cards in 3 suits from a standard French deck. &#10;     Layout: 9 stacks of 3 cards each in a 3x3 grid.&#10;&#10;&#10;(B) &#10;&#10;     12 cards in 3 suits from a standard French deck. &#10;     Layout: 9 stacks of 4 cards each in a 3x3 grid. &#10;     Extra rule: You may never have exactly 6 cards in a suit in your scoring pile. If collecting a suit group would bring the number of cards you have in that suit to 6, you must leave behind a card in the layout, even if it means collecting 0 cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;(C) &#10;&#10;     13 cards in 3 suits and 9 cards in 1 suit from a standard French deck. &#10;     Layout: 16 stacks of 3 cards each in a 4x4 grid. &#10;     Extra rule: The suit with 9 cards is worth half a suit.&#10;&#10;&#10;(D) &#10;&#10;     9 cards in 4 suits from a standard French deck and 9 cards in a suit form a different deck, like a German deck or Tarot deck. &#10;     Layout: 15 stacks of 3 cards each in a 3x5 grid.&#10;&#10;&#10;(E)&#10;&#10;     12 cards in 4 suits from a standard French deck and 12 cards in a suit form a different deck, like a German deck or Tarot deck.&#10;     Layout: 20 stacks of 3 cards each in a 4x5 grid.&#10;     Extra rule: You may never have exactly 6 cards in a suit in your scoring pile.

(Se below for a more precise definition of an arc.)&#10;&#10;You are said to flank an arc of enemy pieces if two of your pieces  are the endpoints of an arc otherwise completely made up of said enemy pieces.&#10;&#10;You may flip an arc of enemy pieces if you are the only one flanking it.&#10;&#10;A loop is a group of stones causing one or more cells not contained in that group to be severed from the edges of the board in this sense: There is no chain of adjacent cells going from any of those severed cells to any edge cell that does not contain at least one stone from the loop group. (It's a curve of stones biting itself in the ass, around at least one enemy stone or at least one empty cell.)&#10;&#10;More precise definition of an arc:&#10;A chain of adjacent pieces make up an arc if it is possible to order them from first to last in a sequence where a walk from the first to the last member of the chain, visiting all members in order, will (i) at no point require a turn of more than 60 degrees, and (ii) either require no clockwise turns or no counter-clockwise turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A fantastic competition is about to take place. The most notable candidates will build an Artificial Intelligence (AI)! This AI will conduct all operations, develop new technologies, design, production, distribution and sales. The AI who earns the most prestige will be named Dynamic Object Solutions CEO and therefore winner of the game.&#10;&#10;In D.O.S. (Dynamic Object Solutions) players manage a set of workers, called AI, that provides for themselves and for the other players with Resources, Performance Points and Data points. These AI will be placed at the main board, to take actions and to collect the aforementioned items. The more powerful the AI the better the action, but at the same time you may give your opponents important points they can take advantage of.&#10;These points will be used at the player board to take actions that will be acquired during the course of the game in the form of cards. Each player can have a very distinct set of actions, and different ways of paying for them.&#10;The game rewards the players for giving each other the means for taking the actions. You need to balance this give and take in order to be more efficient.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ashes is an annihilation game for two players played on a hexhex board with stackable pieces of two colors. The board starts out empty. Still, all you ever do in Ashes is move stacks. This is accomplished by the help of a very liberal understanding of &quot;stack&quot;: A single piece is considered a stack of size 1, and an empty cell is considered to contain a stack of size 0.&#10;&#10;The basic principle of movement is simple: A stack may move to a cell it can see &ndash; i.e. one that is adjacent or joins it in flanking a line of empty cells &ndash; if this cell is not occupied by a bigger stack.&#10;&#10;It is important that, every time you remove a stack from the board, whether it was one of yours of an enemy stack, you keep one of its pieces in a designated area (off the board) as a reminder. I'll get back to why you need to keep count of removed stacks.&#10;&#10;There is an economy to moving whole stacks, which is responsible for stack's coming into and going out of existence (rules for moving proper parts of stacks are given farther down):&#10;&#10;Outward movement gains you:&#10;When a move increases the number of steps away from the center cell the moved stack is, it grows by the addition of 1 piece per step further away it ends up. Pieces initially only come onto the board by moving a stack of size 0 at least 1 step away from the center cell.&#10;&#10;Non-outward movement costs you:&#10;When a move does not increase the number of steps away from the center cell the moved stack is, it shrinks by the removal of 1 more than 1 piece per step closer it ends up. This means that a stack not moving outward can travel no farther inward than 1 less than its size.&#10;&#10;Reproduction tax:&#10;If you increase the number of stacks you own, the resulting size of the newly created stack must be big enough to pay a reproduction tax equal to the number of stacks you have removed from the board (whether friendly or not). For each removed stack, you must subtract a piece from the newly created stack, and the gross size of the stack must be bigger than the number of stacks you have lost, so that its net size is at least 1. If white's reproduction tax is 2, moving a 0-stack three steps away from the center will only result in a 1-stack.&#10;&#10;Splitting stacks:&#10;Instead of moving a whole stack, you may move a proper part of a stack. Only the reproduction tax applies to the moving of proper stack parts. This means that a splitting move can get you places a whole stack move can't.&#10;&#10;Splitting a stack can (and normally does) increase the number of stacks you own. When it does, a reproduction tax must be paid.&#10;&#10;There is no free passing in Ashes. If you can move, you must. This ensures that stacks must eventually (if they are not captured before that) spend all their pieces moving &quot;non-outward&quot;, and the reproduction tax will eventually be too high to enter a new stack on the board. The game is over as soon as one player has no stacks on the board and is unable to grow a new stack.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Does the starfish beat the seagull or the seal beat a cockle?&#10;&#10;Ostsee-Schach is a refreshing, fast chess variant by Dirk Holdorf, in which 2 players aged 8 and up compete with Baltic Sea animals in a tournament. &#10;You take turns and play until one of you scores 3 victory points and thus wins - or has only one piece left and thus loses.&#10;&#10;You get victory points by stacking 3 discs or by moving your own pieces to the opposite edge of the board.&#10;When it is your turn, you move one of your pieces according to the animal you see on it. The figure can consist of only one disc or of two discs, with the upper one belonging to you.&#10;If you move one of your own pieces onto a square where there is already an opponent's piece, you simply place your piece on top of the other one and take it over. If it is then three discs high, you receive a victory point.&#10;However, you may never stack more than 3 discs on top of each other. &#10;Then it is your opponent's turn until one of you has collected the required three victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Choose the bluffer card if deception turns you on. Choose more sabotage cards (like the bully) if you like to undermine your buddies.
