It is a pure card game, ideal for carrying to social events at court, classical concerts, and salons. It will fit under your wig, and the beautiful printed box prevents any powder or snuff from getting to the cards. All Ladies and Gentlemen of refinement will surely want to acquire a copy forthwith.&#10;&#10;The rules for Your Majesty are free! No, your spectacles have not deceived you, you can read the game rules by clicking here with your quill. Sapere Aude!

Red tape, too many odd rules, all in the name of the realism. it is just too unbelievable for gaming.&#10;&#10;So what we have done here, is sort through all the good, the bad and the ugly of all the rules we have played, and tried to come up with a set that will stay together when the real fighting starts.&#10;&#10;Many rule sets have good qualities about them. What we have done here is try to take all those good thing and make a grand tactical miniature wargame out of them for 15mm to 20 mm figures. With little difficulty one can  adapt these rules to fit 6, 10, 25, 30 or 40 mm figures.&#10;&#10;The rules are for grand tactical division and corps play although there is no reason you cannot use them for tactical regimental level games. &#10;Players do not need tons of dice just a few D-10 and D-6 dice will do. There is no writing of rules and most games can be played in three to four hours with resolution.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "If you were picked on your entire life, would you consider finding a way to fight back?  In Kobolds Vs. Goblins that's what happens! When the leader of a small tribe of Kobolds has finally had enough of being picked on and ridiculed, he comes up with a plan.  Not just &quot;a&quot; plan, &quot;the&quot; plan!  If the ones picking on him are doing it because they are stronger and bigger than him, he'll find someone bigger and stronger than THEM!&#10;&#10;It's a foolproof plan.  He decides to swear allegiance to the Mightiest of them all, the great red dragon.  But, he knows he can't just go alone.  The great red dragon wouldn't even bat an eye at a single Kobold seeking to join his ranks.  The plan calls for a much larger number of Kobolds to show up and wear their allegiance.  He isn't sure, but he thinks 30 sounds like a pretty large number.&#10;&#10;So, the plan, to reiterate, is to recruit 30 Kobolds to join the cause and follow the great red dragon, then, make fun of all the ones that have made fun of us because we'll have the protection of the great red dragon!&#10;&#10;This is the perfect plan, well it was!  Unfortunately, the Goblins (Another of the puny races that always gets picked on and our bitter rivals) heard about &quot;the plan&quot;.  The Goblins have decided to copy the plan and only change one little detail... they are going to swear allegiance to the Great Orcish Chieftain!  How dare they steal the plan that took me the whole time I was on the poop pot!&#10;&#10;The plan has changed, well, no, not really.  But now we have to do it faster than them!  Then, we'll have the great red dragon smoosh those little green meanies!&#10;&#10;Oh, I've gone on a tangent haven't I?&#10;&#10;Ahem...&#10;&#10;You'll love the fast paced nature of Kobolds Vs. Goblins with the rapid dice rolls, the press-your-luck mechanics blended perfectly with Roll &amp; Write tracking system for a sweet 5-15 minute game that you'll want to play again and again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unpredictable events occur there, the detectives may encounter the femme fatale, end up in the bar for a while, or chase the suspect. They gather black and white tokens they can use to cancel effects of unfavorable events. The tokens also determine to which final path (peace, justice, revenge) a player goes. Then they roll dice and earn victory points for achieving various endings (beware, death is one of them). Being the first to achieve an ending, having an alliance with the femme fatale and/or catching the suspect gives the players bonus points.&#10;&#10;Printed components are: board (A4 or A3 format) and 80 tokens (2x A4). Rules have 4 pages. Additional components needed are: different-colored pawns (2-5 for detectives, 1 for femme fatale, 1 for a suspect, 1 spare pawn if possible) and 1-2 six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ICE is our home.ICE is our world. ICE is corrupted. ICE is dying.&#10;&#10;ICE is a mega-city. Ice is dying from within. Before our history began, the Gods created this world and seeded a civilisation that spread to cover the entire planet. They raised us up - the eight exalted families, they gave us a sun that would never dim, they gave us technology. Then they left.&#10;&#10;Why they did so is a question that has had no answer, until now. For our sun is dying, the corrupted machines are spreading. But after eons away, the Gods have finally returned. To help us battle for survival?         Possibly.&#10;&#10;In ICE players take on characters representing one of the exalted families born from the genetic seed of the ancient Kchemic Gods. They must work together (semi co-op play) as powerful agents of the Gods in mission-based scenarios to hunt down and defeat corrupted threats in the dying city. A clever AI mechanism in game will keep players on their toes as they try to zero in on the location of the final enemy. With many NPCs to interact with and city sectors that change position and purpose, no two games will ever be the same!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

He declares that the nobles shall together build a golden pyramid. The emperor demands a pyramid that consists of four levels, with the upper levels being build upon colorful artistic colonnades. The one whose contribution impresses the emperor the most will become the new emperor.&#10;&#10;How to build a pyramid:&#10;&#10;The cubes in this game represent the columns of the pyramid and are bought by playing a card. The number or cubes a player may draw from the bag is determined by the value shown on the card. Cubes can also be obtained from a common market or by trading with other players.&#10;&#10;To actually build a part of the pyramid the players need four cubes (second level or higher) and a card that shows the symbol of an available tile as well as a value that equals at least the level that should be build.&#10;&#10;Players mainly gain victory points by building tiles and placing cubes adjacent to already placed cubes of the same color.&#10;&#10;The Golden Pyramid was one of two Gold Winners of the 2019 Contest X for the Green Box of Games. In order to play the game the Meeple Mini Expansion or replacements (20 white 10mm cubes, 20 black 10mm cubes, a drawbag and e.g. meeples in player colors) are needed.&#10;&#10;",

Glossy color covers, BW interiors, same length as the previous, first edition.  The game is a massive evolution of the first Age of Eagles and includes:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Correction of all grammar, vocabulary and spelling errors.&#10;&bull;    Interpretations of rules integrated into the text of the document.&#10;&bull;    Rules changes, from both the author and our 3000 + person Yahoo Group added and integrated into the text of the book.&#10;&bull;    New rules and data charts, from both the author and the Yahoo Group added and integrated into the text of the document.&#10;&bull;    New army lists and generals, to include an all-new Ottoman army chart and a slew of Spanish generals.&#10;&bull;    Changes are easily identified by underlined text.&#10;&#10;Like its predecessor, Age of Eagles II is based on Fire &amp; Fury for the American Civil War. This is a BIG battle game where units are infantry and cavalry brigades, as well as artillery batteries of between 6 and 12 guns. Each infantry stand represents 360-foot soldiers while each cavalry stand represents 180 mounted troopers. Ground scale is 120 yards to each inch, while all game turns represent 30 minutes of actual time. Players command corps, not battalions, and engagements of 150,000 plus combatants are an easy gaming reality.&#10;&#10;The complete AOE related product line is sold direct thru digital distribution, though hardcopy versions are available from certain retailers. AOE II is 96+ pages long. Kindle formatted products are sold exclusively thru Amazon, while digital downloads exportable to PDF format may be purchased via Google Play.&#10;&#10;Online, public research portal for this game and its historical period (to include flags for miniatures, official histories, Public Domain military maps, images and publications - all copyright friendly and FREE to download) at https://tinyurl.com/AOE-Napoleonic-Research-Portal.&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Grand Battles Napoleon is a set of rules for recreating Napoleonic battles with model soldiers.&#10;&#10;Players can play GBN using any scale from 6mm all the way up to 28mm miniatures and there are guidelines for gaming in the various scales. &#10;Units represent infantry regiments, cavalry regiments, artillery batteries and skirmish battalions and screens.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of army or corps commanders. Each player usually commanding around four to five divisions, with each division composed of between two to seven units. Thus the average size of a game is a corps + assets depending on which nation you are using.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by two important, and to my mind exciting mechanisms, command initiative and response. Both these mechanisms make the game completely interactive at all times, inspired by Koenig Krieg.&#10;&#10;Grand Battles Napoleon is definitely not a you-go-I-go game. It is very important that players understand the function of initiative in this set of rules as it governs most of the actions that occur during a turn. Actions are not sequential, neither are they simultaneous. Instead commanders test initiative several times during the turn. The player who wins the initiative test may activate one of his divisions or force his opponent to activate one of their divisions instead. Both players roll for initiative round after round until all units on both sides have had a chance to act. In this way each player is kept &ldquo;in the game&rdquo; at all times, with each general tied to their initiative, command ability and the important decision to strike now or force their opponent to act instead!&#10;&#10;The second exciting mechanism is response. Response is divided between command response and unit response. Commanders need to perform response tests if they wish to perform sweeping grand tactical orders, maintain command control should they find themselves outside command range of their corps, wing or army general or to steady the troops from becoming demoralised as casualties in the division mount.&#10;&#10;Unit response allows your troops to act out of turn and react to movement within their zone of control or when being charged. So that even within the other player&rsquo;s activation the non acting player is never really out of the game.&#10;&#10;You will be will be able to re-fight historical battles, or  play any one of 10 points based missions from Grand Battles Napoleon and Legion d&rsquo;honneur supplement. Legion d'Honneur are our free campaign and Big Bash rules, suitable for running tournaments, big multi-day games and linked campaigns.&#10;&#10;Units act via operations. The types and amount of operations a unit may perform are defined by the type of unit, is it cavalry, infantry, skirmishers, the units national character, i.e. does the infantry prefer fighting in lines or column, and the quality of the troops, are they guards or militia?&#10;&#10;So in the immortal words of Marshal Gebhard von Bl&uuml;cher, &quot;Raise the flag high my brave lads. Forwards to victory!&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You can also build historical Light, Dragoon, Cuirassier and Guard cavalry divisions as well as deploy Grand Batteries.&#10;&#10;We have also added in our selection of National Heroes into the Headquarters options. Napoleon comes to mind - naturally! However you can also select Ney, Davout, Lannes, Massena, Soult, Macdonald and Nansouty. Men like Murat and Eugene, who also commanded other national forces will be highlighted in those handbooks. Both of these French Generals will be found in the Armies of Italy handbook. All national traits and special rules pertaining to the French are easily located in the glossary at the end of the book, so you will never have to worry about trying to find out what Marie Louise troops can and cannot do!&#10;&#10;Vive la France!

You can build British, Spanish, Portuguese, KGL, Hanoverian, Brunswick, Nassau, Netherlands and Emigre armies using Wellington's Armies Parade Handbooks.&#10;&#10;The army list building options are very flexible and clearly laid out. Using these lists you can pretty much build any Revolutionary, Peninsular and 1815 historical army organisation using any of these nine nations. Perhaps you are looking to build a 1st Coalition Iberian army composed of Portuguese and Spanish to fight those dastardly French Revolutionaries during the War of Rousillon or maybe mix in some British and Emigre's for a Toulon campaign. Alternatively, a British expeditionary force to Egypt, a British, Spanish or Portuguese force in the peninsular or a glorious British-Allied army to drive back Napoleon from the ridges at Waterloo. Whatever you decide it can be done with this book.&#10;&#10;Such a glorious celebration of Wellington's overwhelming influence upon the wars and national armies he commanded, besides his own British redcoats, would not be complete without a few national general options such as Wellington, Moore, Crawford, Forbes, Prince of Orange and the Duke of Brunswick to name a few. Oh and to round the whole book off what better way to celebrate Wellington's Armies than a recipe for Beef Wellington to be made for your next Waterloo game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players choose characters and get special advantages based on their unique character abilities. Compete with other players as you race through the jungle. Your goal is to collect tokens to fill your character tracker. Battle the evil forces and encounter windfalls but remember to be careful! Everything could change at a moment&rsquo;s notice!&#10;&#10;The first player to gain 6 tokens is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has 3 lives until they are dead (this is from the movie).&#10;&#10;There are three cards that are placed face up. On a players turn, they select one of the cards to use for the turn. Cards may give you an extra life, give you an extra die, allow you to steal a token (VP) from another player, or fight a bad guy. Fighting the bad guys are the main event battles you will perform.&#10;&#10;Combat is very easy. Each card (bad guy) allows you to ask other players to join a fight. Then there is a number that collectively all the players must roll equal to or higher than. If they do so, they each get a token (VP). If not, the lead player loses a life (you only get 3!).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Take turns placing your own colour pieces on any free hex on the board. When you have three in a row you can crown any one of the three into a king by placing a piece on top of another, a mechanic inspired by the abstract boardgame LOT. The other two pieces of the original line of three must be removed from the board but can be played again. Once you have crowned the piece, if it is adjacent to an opponents king and you can jump over that king into a free space behind you can then remove the opponents king. This is the only occasion a piece can move on the board after being placed. A newly crowned piece can only jump another King. A single piece cannot be jumped. Return the jumped pieces to your opponent. Continue playing until a player has managed to reach a winning position of creating three Kings In A Row (KIAR) or until a player runs out of pieces. In that scenario the first player who cannot make a move due to not having any pieces left loses.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It was armed with a single Lewis machine&ndash;gun, set in a difficult to reach position over the upper wing and when used in balloon busting with four Le Prieur rockets on each side. With a top speed of over 100 mph (ca. 161 km/h), it was superior to its predecessors, but lacked in maneuverability; still, it represented an important stepping stone for the Nieuport line.&#10;&#10;Nieuport 16 (Ball)&#10;Considered a &ldquo;lone wolf,&rdquo; Albert Ball was a British ace scoring multiple victories on this Nieuport, including the destruction of an observation balloon with phosphor bombs.&#10;&#10;New versions: &#10;&#10;Nieuport 16 (Navarre)&#10;Jean Navarre, the Sentinel of Verdun, the first French pilot to shoot down two enemy aircrafts in a day and the first to be officially declared an ace.

Over 5000 aircraft were produced.&#10;&#10;Raf SE.5 (Bishop)&#10;The Canadian ace &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; Bishop was one of the top scoring pilots of the World War I (72 victories), including 25 in one 10-day period.

    "Description": "1. The core gameplay of War with Goblins is the fight between different troops and conquering cities. Each player has at his disposal many units, which he can successively introduce to the game if he has only the right number of ducats. About 24 different types of troops take part in the war. On the obverse of the board we have the land map and on the reverse the second, sea map. The game has climatic, oldschool fantasy graphics, perfectly depicting a magical world in which humans coexist with goblins.&#10;&#10;2. This is a turn-based war game. The board is divided into areas. Each of them has one type of terrain assigned to it. Terrain affects the movement of units as well as their combat strength. There are 12 cities on the board, a number of villages and dungeons, which are the source of money (ducats).&#10;Each player in his turn can buy troops on the board (in the form of tokens), moves them, occupy areas and fights battles. The strength of the units, their HP, and partly the dice decide about the result of the clashes. Units can be combined into larger groups, up to 4 units.&#10;&#10;3. The player who has the most cities after 6, 8 or 10 rounds wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Can they trust you? I don't know, but I'm pickin' up some strange vibes. Could be that tuna I ate earlier...&quot;&#10;&#10;Nuke? the Card Game puts players in the hot-seat as billionaires and world leaders with two simple goals: 1) to make more many than they ever did, 2) to not get blowed up.&#10;&#10;You will be embodying a richer you, and over the course of 3 rounds, collecting sets of commodities to ensure a profitable asset portfolio. How will you accomplish this? Through trade negotiations of course! In real-time, you and your friends will be making deals as shrewdly as possible, but it's in the follow through that your true colours will show. Should you deal honestly and fulfill your end of the bargain? Or should you forsake your responsibility and send the all-dreaded nuke? See, here's the trick: all of the cards that are traded remain hidden until the end of the round. And then, just when you think you're all set to make a fat stack of dough... you flip your cards to reveal 3 nukes! Thanks guys, thanks a lot.&#10;&#10;To add a little more chaos into the mix you'll receive a secret identity, and in the second round you'll get 2, and in the third round, 3. Talk about split personalities... These Identity cards might give you a scoring bonus or even a powerful single-use ability to whap out at the most opportune time. Pretty neat! Now it's time for you to put your power of persuasion to the test. But even for the shrewdest shark, at the end of the day the only question that remains is this: should you be a stable and trustworthy friend, or should you send a Nuke?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Polemos War of Spanish Succession is specifically aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts. For instance, troops using the platoon firing system have improved close range factors, while others using fire by ranks are allowed to be more aggressive.&#10;&#10;Chosen men, well disposed is therefore produced as one of two sets of rules produced to cover the period. &#10;CMWD enables the player to recreate the small to medium sized battles of the War of Spanish Succession, or crucial parts of the major battles. Use CMWD you can, if you wish, replay General Webb&rsquo;s action at Wynendael or perhaps the attack of the Allied left column on the village of Blenheim.&#10;&#10;The aim of the rules is to allow you to fight actions of this size to a finish in three to four hours while retaining the feel of warfare in this period and giving you some tactical control over your troops&#10;&#10;The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal; only the nominal scale will differ.&#10;&#10;Basing and Representation&#10;&#10;     The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos CMWS is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.&#10;     A base of infantry in CMWD represents between 300 and 500 men. This generally represents a battalion in most armies of the period. Some armies tended to field larger battalions and these will be represented by two bases.&#10;     A base of cavalry represents a regiment or two to three squadrons.&#10;     An artillery base represents 2-3 guns.&#10;     All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.&#10;     This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Oh Poo is not just another card elimination game.  Sure, you discard and pass cards, but you also get to flush and plunge them as well.  All you need to do to win is avoid being the player last to hold the Poo Card!&#10;&#10;Game Play Instructions:  Don&rsquo;t get stuck holding the Poo!  Flush it, use the plunger, trick a fellow player into taking it off your hands... Keep it far away!&#10;&#10;Getting Started: Shuffle the deck and deal out all cards. Some players may have an extra card compared to other players. That&rsquo;s okay! Look at the cards you were dealt. If you have any two matching food card pairs discard them into a discard pile.   ***If you have three of the same cards, you discard two (one pair). If you have four of the same cards you can discard all four (two pair).&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;t let any players see your cards that are not able to be discarded!  Keep them secret!&#10;&#10;After all players have discarded matching pairs, the youngest player goes first by drawing a single random card from the player on their right. Any new matching food card pairs, if a matching card was drawn, gets discarded right away and then the player on the right does the same, going around the table allowing each player to draw one card and discard pairs if able.&#10;&#10;&#10;            Anytime two food cards match they should be discarded. &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The Plunger Card: If you have a Plunger Card you can play it at the beginning of your turn or at the very end of your turn. When you play a Plunger Card it gets discarded immediately and is removed from the game. Playing the Plunger Card switches the direction players draw cards from. If the table had been drawing cards from the player on their right, they would now switch to drawing cards from the player on their left. Anytime a Plunger Card is played the direction changes. There are only four Plunger Cards in the deck.&#10;&#10;The Toilet Card: The Toilet Card never gets discarded, but can switch from player to player if randomly drawn. Whenever you have the Toilet Card and the Poo Card in your hand you can flush the Poo Card by giving it to any player of your choice. When flushing the Poo you have to show everybody you have the toilet card. You keep the Toilet Card in your hand after flushing the poo, as it could be drawn by the player drawing cards from you on their next turn.&#10;&#10;The Poo Card:  If you are left with no food cards in your hand and don&rsquo;t have the Toilet Card, but are holding the Poo Card, you lose the game. OH POO!&#10;&#10;Anytime you discard all your food cards and have no other cards in your hand during your turn, you are &lsquo;out&rsquo; and can sit back and watch the remaining players struggle to avoid being stuck with the Poo Card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Of course it is!&#10;The aim of the game is to rip this treasure under your dirty nails before someone else does. There&lsquo;s only the one or the other catch. On the one hand you still are on the wrong island and unfortunately you have to find a treasure map here first, on the other hand you have to collect 5 different building materials for a  proper raft in order to travel to the treasure island. However, the island won&acute;t reveal neither the treasure map nor resources voluntarily. You will have to explore the island and find what you need or &ldquo;acquire&ldquo; it otherwise. You will, good or bad, find much more than you like. The island holds innumerable dangers and adventures for you, which have to be conquered in order to leave the island. It goes without saying that also the deeps of the sea are pretty demanding too. Basically you could bathe in adventures. &#10;Apart from that... You are not the only scoundrel who is after the treasure and you will have to deal with your opponents in many different ways. You better leave moral considerations to the landlubbers....
