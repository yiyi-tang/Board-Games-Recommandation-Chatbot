If someone places the final piece of trash into the bin without knocking anything over, they receive a bonus.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the sixth penalty token has been handed out, and whoever has the fewest penalty points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Allies possess more tanks, including the &ldquo;Queen of the Desert,&rdquo; the Matilda, and have mastery of the air.  Crossing the Egyptian border into Libya their mission is simple:  destroy the Afrika Korps, and lift the siege of Tobruk!  The Axis forces in the path of the Allied advance occupy well-prepared strongpoints, and lurking somewhere behind them are the German panzers &ndash; and Rommel, &ldquo;The Desert Fox.&rdquo;  The next three days of battle will decide the course of the war in the desert for months to come.&#10;&#10;Utilizing a new and streamlined version of the &ldquo;area-impulse&rdquo; system players will experience the uncertainty of the desert battlefield.  Each turn will contain a variable number of impulses, and both players will be challenged to determine whether it is better to attack first, or defend and then counter-attack.  Having committed one&rsquo;s infantry and armor to battle, artillery support may or may not be available.  To win the Allied player must exploit his numerical edge in armor and artillery, plus airpower, to capture Axis positions and destroy German units.  The Axis player must exploit his greater speed, operational flexibility and superior battlefield recovery, to recapture lost ground and destroy Allied units.  Fast, furious, and chess-like, this is a game for players who love concentrated action!&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day (divided by 12 impulse phases)&#10;Area: 1&quot; = 2 miles / 3.5 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 17 x 22&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (88 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 12-page Operation Battleaxe rulebook&#10;One dual-side printed Players Aid Card&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-3 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Continental Express, players add train cars to their station in the hope of fulfilling objectives and maximizing the value of their secret contract. To start the game, each player chooses one of two contract cards dealt to them; these contracts require players to collect icons of a particular color or groups of like-colored icons or icons and company tokens of differing colors.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns drafting cards from three face-up rows; the card on the end of each row costs nothing, the card in the middle costs $1, and the card closest to each of the three decks costs $2. Players start with no money, however, and the only way to get some is to draft it &ndash; but naturally that means you'll be forgoing other cards. If a player has train cars matching one of the three face-up objective cards, he can choose to discard those train cars and claim the objective &ndash; and since the objectives have the icons that satisfy contracts, you'll probably want to do that.&#10;&#10;In addition to train cars and money, players can draft characters, taking the special action of a character when he drafts one. Actions include things like taking a train car of your choice from the card array, stealing all money from one player, and taking a company token of the color of your choice. The card decks also include two events, and those cards flush either the objective cards on display or the smaller cards that players draft.&#10;&#10;When a player claims his fourth objective, each other player takes one more turn, then the game ends. Players tally the points scored for their contract (if any), their claimed objective cards, and any money still in hand. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each building has one or more streets connecting it to adjacent locations, and after building you can move 1-2 workers along the streets to take actions in up to three buildings; these buildings provide a small amount of resources or allow trades of resources/VPs/money for some better combination of resources/VPs/money.&#10;&#10;A number of the buildings are black market locations that tend to be more powerful than legit businesses, but carry the possibility of stinging you in the end. Each time you build or use a black market building, you draw a chip from a bag. If the chip is black, keep it; if white, the player who has the most black chips and opium is fined and loses half his opium stash. Opium can be quite profitable, but will the cops catch you with dirty hands before you unload the goods?&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the most victory points wins so find the right balance of aboveboard business and criminal doings.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Damage Report is a modular, 2-6 player, simultaneous, real-time, co-operative game where the players take on the role of a starship crew faced with making split-second decisions to survive while in the midst of various catastrophes. Unlike many co-operative games, the simultaneous, real-time nature of the game helps prevent groupthink. This forces players to make decisions with minimal feedback and prevents one player from simply running the show. Your turn never ends, and is only limited to what you can accomplish in 15, 30, 45 or 60 second intervals.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a timer to keep track of their time, moving the timer down a track based upon how long their turn interval is. In most scenarios, the turn interval is based upon the Life Support system status: the more damaged the system is, the less air the player has to &quot;breathe&quot;, thus each turn is extended, as it takes more time to complete their actions.&#10;&#10;The modular board pieces in Damage Report ensure a brand new experience with each game scenario. Each scenario has their own 'success' and 'failure' conditions. The Standard Edition of the game includes three scenarios, however a number of additional scenarios will available as expansions. This will include a 7-10 player expansion.&#10;&#10;",

You have two stacks of tiles in front of you, with each neighboring player having access to the stack closest to them; tiles come in four colors and four firework designs. Four stacks of objective cards are in the middle of the table, along with four crowd-pleaser tiles.&#10;&#10;On a turn, take a tile from the top of either stack and place it in the 3x3 grid on your board, whether on the ground level or on an existing stack. Alternatively, you can take an objective card from the top of its stack and place it to the left of your board. To end your turn, see whether you've satisfied any of your objectives or the crowd-pleasers that are available to everyone. Move each completed objective to the right of your board.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player has completed six objectives or a stack of firework tiles has run out, the game concludes at the end of the round. In addition to scoring completed objectives and claimed crowd-pleasers, you have a target color and firework type depicted on your board. Each tile of this color or type at the top of a stack on your board is worth as many points as the number of tiles in that stack. If a tile matches both color and type, you score it twice.&#10;&#10;Can you shoot the right fireworks to victorious heights?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the late Middle Ages, the Canary Islands had faded into obscurity from a European point of view. There was neither gold nor silver, and the islands did not play a role as a trading post because the north-south trade of that time went through the Sahara.&#10;&#10;In 1312, the Genoese merchant and seafarer Lancelotto Malocello effectively &quot;rediscovered&quot; the Canary Islands. During the 15th century, the archipelago was conquered by the Spanish. Spanish masters pushed agriculture, cultivating sugar cane, wine and grain, which quickly gave the islands a certain economic value and importance.&#10;&#10;In West of Africa, the players cultivate goods, try to sell them profitably, and build settlements. Each player has their own deck of cards. Each turn the players select cards from their decks to conduct successful actions, always keeping the actions of the other players in mind.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warhammer Ancient Battles is a historically-orientated version of the popular Warhammer rules. Originally created as an independent spin-off from the Warhammer Fantasy Battle rules, it was subsequently brought back in-house at Games Workshop and now functions as a separate division of the company. Some of the rules inconsistencies that the parent game is so famous for have been ironed out, as have some of the more outrageously unrealistic rules. Don't expect massive historical accuracy though: the emphasis is still on a fun, playable system over real historical or military realism. The rulebook tells you everything you need to play the game and comes with two generic army lists for &quot;Romans&quot; and &quot;Barbarians&quot;. The authors actively encourage players to get their miniatures from a range of different manufacturers. Further army list supplements are available and you'll need to supply your own scenery too!&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Warhammer: Armies of Antiquity &#226;&#128;&#147; A Supplement for Ancient Battles (1999) (no longer in print, replaced by the all the following...)&#10;    Warhammer: Fall of the West &#226;&#128;&#147; A Supplement for Ancient Battles (2000)&#10;    Shieldwall (2002)&#10;    Warhammer: Chariot Wars &#226;&#128;&#147; A Supplement for Ancient Battles (2002)&#10;    Alexander the Great (2003)&#10;    Armies of Chivalry (2004)&#10;    Spartacus (2004)&#10;    Byzantium: Beyond the Golden Gate (2005)&#10;    Hannibal and the Punic Wars (2005)&#10;    El Cid (2006)&#10;    Vlad the Impaler (2006)&#10;    The Age of Arthur (2007)&#10;    The Art of War (2007)&#10;    Siege & Conquest (2007)&#10;&#10;&#10;Reprinted once, with the errata (version 1.5).&#10;&#10;Warhammer Ancient Battles, 2nd edition was published April 2010.&#10;&#10;",

Two maps cover all of Europe. Off map boxes represent Asia / Africa.&#10;&#10;Game year is broken down into 9 turns. Production takes place on the interphase every 3 turns. Either side may move first on a given turn. Two different combat systems are included. The initial combat system simulates the 1914 battles w/o trenches. Losses are lower and retreats are likely. In 1915 a new combat system is used. This new system is detailed, but does a good job showing the complexities of trench warfare (retreats are scarce and losses are real high).

The map covers the BAOR sector and includes the major West German cities of Hannover and Kassel.&#10;&#10;Fifth Corps uses a collection of mechanics, including &quot;Operations Points&quot; and &quot;Friction Points&quot;, variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, Airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare.&#10;&#10;The game contains two scenarios. &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; is the campaign scenario, covering the first five days of the war in the BAOR sector. &quot;The Race to the Weser&quot; covers the first 60 hours of combat in the region between Hannover and Kassel.&#10;&#10;",

It is essentially the tactical ship combat game for the &quot;Space: 1889&quot; role-playing system.&#10;&#10;The game has a lot of mechanics that are similar to Star Fleet Battles and Interceptor.  It has a distinct 'naval' feel about it though... think of a game like Wooden Ships & Iron Men, with altitude thrown into the mix.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns of three phases.  In the Initiative Phase, players form or disband boarding parties and change crew assignments.  They also roll dice to see who becomes the First Player that turn.&#10;&#10;Two Movement/Fire Phases follow.  The moving player moves all of his vessels, both players fire (depending on range, weapon, etc.), damage is taken, then the second player repeats the full move/fire action.&#10;&#10;Two large hex, beautifully rendered maps are included in the game to accomodate detailed plastic ships.  The rules are broken into two parts: Basic (the game at its simplest level with basic rules for moving, firing, taking damage, etc.) and Advanced (adds more detailed rules such as: ramming and grappling, towing, small arms, crew quality, etc.).  Also included are seven Scenarios and rules for a Campaign game.&#10;&#10;Replaced by Ironclads And Ether Flyers&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Very nice combination of tile placement and betting. Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest. The trick is that when you lay a tile to raise a tower one, two or three stories tall, this controls how much you can bet (1,2 or 3 tokens) and crucially, which draw pile you take from (pile 1, 2 or 3). Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I've bet on, but that means I have to lay a card three stories, and so I might have to play a tile from my hand that helps the other players! A very nice mechanism which gives those simple, frustrating choices we all enjoy. The scoring gives points to the first and second majority backers on each tower.&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to move your pieces across the board onto your opponent's back rank, the row closest to him, by moving your phalanxes and capturing enemy pieces.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;Crossings that is on a 8x8 board.&#10;&#10;",

To their credit they did create a game that was very unlike Magic in play and flavor. The card types are:&#10;&#10;Characters - These are your soldiers and they are laid out in a grid that is a maximum of three deep.  You can only attack or defend with the first untapped character in each row (with exceptions of course).  Some characters also generate Pull points.  These are used like money to bring cards in play or to generate influence which is needed to win so they of course must be protected.&#10;&#10;Resources - These generate Pull for bringing cards into play.  Pull generated from resources can not be used to generate influence.&#10;&#10;Whammy - These are instants that you can play anytime.&#10;&#10;Gear - These are items you can assign to characters.&#10;&#10;Condition - These are assigned to characters and can have positive or negative affects.&#10;&#10;Environmental - These cards affect the game as a whole.&#10;&#10;Secrets - These usually affect cards from specific conspiracies.&#10;&#10;The game is generally played by putting your big hitters in your front row, your big defenders in your second row and your pull generators in your last row.  First player to generate a predetermined amount of influence wins.&#10;&#10;The art on the cards is very strange and different people either love or despise.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls a unique charioteer competing on the giant track for two or more laps. You can also play with up to four teams of two chariots, each representing a different Roman faction.&#10;&#10;But there is more to winning the laurel wreath of victory than just handling dangerous corners! Charioteers can whip and ram their opponents to hinder them during the race (to the crowd&rsquo;s delight). The gods are watching, too, along with the tens of thousands in the crowd, and they may be inclined to influence the race in their favor!&#10;&#10;So strap yourself into your chariot, ready your whip, and pay tribute to Caesar in Chariots of Rome!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the city of Nuestra Senora Santa Maria del Buen Ayre along the river Rio de la Plata. After a brief period of collaboration, the relationship with the Natives was ruined by the Conquistadores' arrogance. A war started, and an alliance between different Natives groups factions successfully drove the invaders from their land and destroyed the city.&#10;&#10;Almost fifty years later, Juan de Garay led a new expedition and founded a new city in the same area with the name of Ciudad de Trinidad. This city flourished to become modern Buenos Aires. Just like the first attempt, resources are low and the Natives, aware of the danger represented by the Spaniards, are ready to combat the intruders. To add to this tension, the English Crown has paid various Corsairs to threaten the new Spanish settlement!&#10;&#10;In Trinidad players represent the heads of the Spanish families in Buenos Aires. The game is set in 1580 and covers the following 120 years, allowing the players to develop the city how they think is better. They can promote commerce with Spain, constructing a Harbor, and creating many productive buildings, or in another way, they can promote the construction of the biggest city buildings like the Cathedral, the Fort or the Cabildo. They can chase the richness, try to build an army or try to collaborate with the Church. They can link their policy to some famous city character, which will push a specific skill. But also this decision will not be easy! Some city representatives want to exploit all available resources and do a new war with Natives. Others push to collaborate with them, try to join forces and combat with the Corsairs. And you, what will you do?&#10;&#10;Trinidad is a strategy game based on player actions and worker placement 2.0 mechanic, where workers have multiple functions and can be used in several different ways. The game also includes several other mechanics like action card combinations, character management, trading, and diplomacy. The game comes full of great miniatures for the historical buildings, workers, conquistadores, and warriors. Trinidad is inspired by the 2010 board game Rio de la Plata.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fall Blau: Army Group South, June-December 1942, is a simulation depicting the 1942 campaigns of Army Group South to take the Caucasus and Stalingrad using a modified version of the classic Operation Typhoon / Victory in the West system. This involves a chit pull for strong units to determine strength upon entering combat. The basic turn sequence is classic IGO-UGO which consists of movement and combat, with possible attacks for mechanized units during movement. Planes are simplified through the use of Air Points. The Axis player is limited by supply limitations with a support system that easily restricts him from having the strength to attack everywhere at once!&#10;&#10;Each scenario breaks battles off into smaller pieces for shorter playtime. Basic units are divisions, with Soviet corps, brigades, and tank battalions, as needed. Order of Battle from various sources, largely from the works of David Glantz, and fine tuned to give a reasonably accurate flow to the campaign.&#10;&#10;Five maps run from Kursk in the north to towards Baku in the south across the diagonal. A sixth map is included for playing three of the smaller scenarios with larger hexes. There are a few extra German divisions available as options. The Eleventh Armee can be kept from going to Leningrad and sent to help capture the oilfields as an option. Free setup options are available and automatic victory goals based on Hitler's whim.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3 days&#10;Hex: 6.5 miles / 10 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;Two 21 x 24&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;One 10 x 21&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;Four dual-side printed countersheets (980-1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Fall Blau rulebook&#10;Six single-side (9&quot;x11&quot;) Player Aid Cards&#10;Six dual-side (9&quot;x11&quot;) Player Aid Cards&#10;Three dual-side (11&quot;x17&quot;) Player Aid Cards&#10;One 10-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-50 Hours&#10;&#10;",

The pride of the Royal Navy went to the bottom of the Denmark Strait southwest of Iceland and Bismarck disappeared into the fog. But HMS Prince of Wales had managed to hit Bismarck below the water line, and she left behind her a slick of fuel oil. The British Home Fleet relentlessly tracked the German warship, and she finally sank beneath a hail of gunfire.&#10;&#10;This Second World War at Sea game has one of the larger operational maps in the series; the North Atlantic is a big and empty place. There are two 34x22-inch maps, covering the area from north of Iceland south to the latitude of Spain. The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.&#10;&#10;The game includes 24 pages of rules and 12 scenarios which feature not just the Bismarck chase, but also the North Atlantic raids made by the German warships Admiral Hipper, Admiral Scheer, Gneisenau and Scharnhorst.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the not-too-distant future, the most entertaining sport in the world requires killer reflexes, a passion to succeed, and a degree in science or engineering. Bot battling is all the rage, and Gekido: Bot Battles gives 2-4 players the chance to enter the arena and face off in 30-minute fights. Each round, the bots lock onto a target, then roll dice to execute attacks. Through cunning moves and swift strikes, players can activate secret powers in the arena and eliminate the competition. The last bot standing takes home the electric glory!&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Description of the first edition:&#10;&#10;For a long time the Lord of Gems &mdash; Jikan, the mightiest dragon of all &mdash; feared that another dragon could take his place as the most powerful dragon. Soon he realized that only his sons could compete with him, so Jikan swallowed them. For many years Jikan lived happily as the king, eating whole worlds for breakfast. But one day, during a heartburn crisis, he saw that his sons were battling in his stomach. The first one to win and escape the belly of Jikan will be the next Lord of Gems!&#10;&#10;Gekido is a dice game in which each player controls a dragon, trying to beat other players by knocking their life dices from 6 points to zero. At each round, players rolls six 6 sided dice and try to score one of many combinations showed in his character sheet (pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, etc), but watch out! If you fail on your gamble attempt you can hurt yourself instead of the enemy! As the battle gets more fierce, however, players would unlock new powers: when one of your life dices is reduced to zero, you gain new special abilities! The player who remains in play, knocking all opponent's life dices, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game depicts the struggles of the Kim Regime from 1953 to present day North Korea against the West.&#10;&#10;In the aftermath of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean peninsula divided in two. While its signature marked a cessation of armed conflict, the war was not over. In over six decades since the armistice was signed, three generations of the Kim regime resisted Chinese and Soviet influence, endured floods, famine, isolation and economic sanctions while defiantly pursuing nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;One player will be the DPRK (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea), seeking a nuclear deterrent to invasion, improving living standards to prevent uprising, and purging elites to prevent a coup.&#10;&#10;Another player will be the West, aiding defectors to obtain intel, stymieing the missile program to secure the region, implementing sanctions to impede the North Korean economy and further isolating the DPRK from the global community to intensify pressure on the regime.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is based on the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; game book of the same name.  This series of books is similar to the &quot;pick your path&quot; type of adventure books that TSR and many others published around this time (mid 1980's).  Fighting Fantasy was somewhat different in that you created a character and rolled for combat and other effects instead of automatically succeeding in whatever path you chose (like a Tunnels and Trolls solo dungeon).&#10;&#10;Anyway, the game is very similar to Dungeon from TSR.  Characters roam the labyrinth fighting creatures and gaining treasures to increase their power.  Characters have three stats: Skill, Stamina, and Luck and these affect both combat and various perils that are held in the dungeon such as traps.  The object of the game is to travel to the end of the dungeon and open the Warlock's treasure chest.  Along the way players must deduce the correct combination of three keys which will open the chest, and find or steal the appropriate keys.  This is done through a mechanic exactly like Parker Brother's Clue game: you ask players if they have any key cards of a particular number and secretly note down what their answers are.  The first player to open the Warlock's treasure chest wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Fighting Fantasy Game Book is located Here&#10;&#10;",

Scenarios examine the forces available over the entire 44-year period with snapshots in 1945, 1962, 1975, 1983, and 1989. The resulting force ratios not only change with weapon and OOB evolution but as a product of the tumultuous effects of the culture.&#10;&#10;In addition to the typical Warsaw Pact-invades-NATO situations, the game provides for three NATO offensive scenarios. The 1945 Churchill plan to continue WW2 before the Soviets could consolidate their gains (Operation UNTHINKABLE), the mishaps of 1983 that could have launched an offensive in error, and allowing the West to capitalize on the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact nations in 1989.&#10;&#10;Every game is different because while the units set up in their peace-time housing areas, each side gets an unpredictable amount of time to &quot;run up&quot; before the war actually begins while tension rises. The result will allow each side to move to deployment areas (or not) as the fates decree with all combinations of total surprise to total preparedness possible between them.&#10;&#10;Iron Curtain is a fast-paced game of what is assumed to be a month of intensive combat where both sides race to fulfill their objectives before a cease-fire ends hostilities.&#10;&#10;All the developments of modern warfare over this epoch are included: nuclear and chemical warfare, modern near-nuclear aviation effects, airmobile forces, attack helicopters, airborne mech forces, amphibious operations, and even the ill-fated Pentomic Division structure.&#10;&#10;It is your turn to decide the fate of Europe.&#10;&#10;Scenarios (all are a maximum of 10 turns):&#10;&bull; Hot Time in the Town of Berlin&mdash;1945 Western  Allies Offensive&#10;&bull; Don&rsquo;t Fence Me In&mdash;1945 Soviet Offensive&#10;&bull; If I Had a Hammer&mdash;1962 Soviet Offensive&#10;&bull; Bohemian Rhapsody&mdash;1975 Soviet Offensive&#10;&bull; Eye of the Tiger&mdash;1983 Soviet Offensive&#10;&bull; It&rsquo;s a Mistake&mdash;1983 NATO Offensive&#10;&bull; Everybody Wants to Rule the World&mdash;1989 Soviet Offensive&#10;&bull; We Didn&rsquo;t Start the Fire&mdash;1989 NATO Offensive&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&bull; One 8-page Standard Combat Series rulebook (Version 1.8)&#10;&bull; One 52-page Iron Curtain game-specific rulebook&#10;&bull; one 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;&bull; Four dual-side printed countersheets (1120 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;&bull; two full-color Player Displays&#10;&bull; two full-color 2-sided Game Charts &amp; Tables&#10;&bull; box and 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The East India Company grows quickly through the delivery of exotic goods from New World and Far East &ndash; but to operate on such a large scale, the company needs money, so the first world stock market is opened in Amsterdam. Rich citizens see the opportunity to acquire even more riches, so they invest in the stock market, while also wanting to take part in even more opportunities to make profit. Thus, much wanted exotic goods can be bought and sold, too, and with no secure routes a player can make even better profits by trading them.&#10;&#10;In Mercurius players take on the role of rich citizens in Holland in the 17th century. They invest their money in stocks of different branches of the East India Company or try to earn much more profit through risky trade in exotic goods. Players have their own information about activities in the far lands and about events which can influence prices at the market, but each of them sees only part of the picture, so they have to look at what other players are doing and which prices are influenced by them.&#10;&#10;Players have starting cash at the beginning of the game, along with five &quot;changing prices&quot; cards and four cards which allow them to take special actions during play. The game board shows prices for stocks of six branches of the East India Company and for six goods those branches trade. On a turn, a player can make up to three purchases or sales of stocks or goods as he wishes. He then plays one &quot;changing prices&quot; card from his hand. Each card changes the price of one stock and one good. Each card changes the prices three times, once on the turn it's played and on two consecutive turns. The tricky part is that cards move the value of goods twice as much as the value of stocks, so players can earn more by trading goods &ndash; but doing so is far more risky.&#10;&#10;Who will become the richest citizen of Holland and win the game?&#10;&#10;",

Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!&#10;&#10;Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;In The Volcanic Island, you slip into the roles of four students on a volcanic island who face mysterious events. Like a thriller, you need to solve puzzles, make decisions, track traces, and analyze and use objects. You will experience a story together. Gameplay is variable and different in each group.&#10;&#10;Admin note: The first edition of the German edition of The Volcanic Island contains an error for which KOSMOS has released a PDF correction that you'll find in the files.&#10;&#10;",

The same building types and colors may never be placed horizontally or vertically adjacent. During placement, horizontal, vertical and diagonal &quot;streets&quot; emerge, and players score points when they place cards with elements that match other cards along a street. Thus, with each placement, a player has the potential to score points along 4 different streets - 2 diagonal, 1 vertical and 1 horizontal. If a card's color matches others in a street, the player scores points equal to the highest-valued card of that color. If a card's building matches others in a street, the player receives the total sum value of all the matching buildings. Players receive a 7-point bonus for placing the 7th building in a road. Players also receive one special building permit card that allows an extra or out-of-turn play and one statue card, which acts as a wild card. The game ends when the second of two volcano cards in the deck is revealed.&#10;&#10;",

Have the second most damage, gain 1 VP.&#10;&#10;Don't get too attached to your dudes. They will die. Quickly. No worries though, you'll get new ones to carry on the fight. Players can earn tokens to nerph other dude's abilities and shields to protect abilities. Each player also receives just 3 re-roll cubes at the start of the game, and when they are gone, they are gone. So make them count!  In the arena it is usually best to have dudes with abilities that trigger on low numbers and high numbers to ensure you have your bases covered for maximum pointage. &#10;Remember, you can do a single damage and score the most points for a dude if it's the killing blow! So it's not all about brute strength, although that helps too.&#10;&#10;Fight until a player reaches 30+ VP, and that player wins.&#10;&#10;Unhappy Cthulhu vs. Helpless Bunny? Expansionist Alien vs. Righteous Paladin? Coal-fired Robot of Doom vs. a Little Girl? Rabid War Bear vs. Animated Chicken Bone? Mentally-Challenged Goat vs. Pirate Taco?

This stand-alone game adds 63 more types of aircraft, new campaigns, and action cards featuring the new aircraft!&#10;&#10;Down In Flames places each player in the cockpit of a Leader and Wingman as they enter combat against other aircraft. By playing cards, you gain advantageous positions on your targets, fire your guns, and send them down in flames!&#10;&#10;The game is based on a unique action-reaction card mechanic. Each card can be countered by specific other cards. At the bottom of every card is the list of cards it is allowed to cancel. This makes for exciting card play back and forth between players...&#10;&#10;Player #1: &quot;I Play an In My Sights for 3 Hits. If you don&rsquo;t stop it, you&rsquo;re going down.&quot; Player #2: &quot;I counter with a Barrel Roll.&quot; Player #1: &quot;I react with a Yo-Yo.&quot; Player #2: &quot;You got me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each aircraft is accurately simulated with several ratings including: Performance (the maximum cards you can hold), Horsepower (the maximum cards you can draw each turn), Bursts (how many times you can fire), Damage (how much damage your attacks inflict), and Airframe (how much damage your aircraft can sustain).&#10;&#10;The air combat is simulated using a Positioning system that allows aircraft to be Advantaged, Tailing, Disadvantaged, or Tailed in relation to other aircraft. An aircraft&rsquo;s position determines if it can attack, and how many bonus Bursts it receives if it is Advantaged or Tailing.&#10;&#10;The game uses a simple Altitude system to add this vital aspect of air combat. Aircraft get to draw cards when diving, and must discard cards when climbing.&#10;&#10;The game also includes Light, Medium, and Heavy Bombers that are used in the historical campaign games.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;110 Full color Action Cards&#10;126 Full Color Aircraft Cards&#10;Full Color 24 Page Rulebook&#10;Full Color Counter Sheet (176 - 5/8&rdquo; counters)&#10;6 Full Color Campaigns&#10;Full Color Player Log Sheet&#10;&#10;Scheduled Aircraft Cards: &#10;GERMANY&#10;Bf-110G2, Fw-190A6, He-177, Ju-87D, Me-163, Do-335, He-162, Henchel, Bf-109G10, Bf-109F2&#10;&#10;JAPAN&#10;G8N Rita, N1K2 George, J7W1, Ki84 Frank, Sally, A6M8 Zeke, A6M6 Zeke&#10;&#10;UK&#10;Buffalo, Spitfire IX, Lancaster, Meteor, Tempest, Halifax, Typhoon, Beaufighter&#10;&#10;USA&#10;P-38F, P-47B, B-25, B-17G, Avenger, B-29, B-24J, F4U-4&#10;&#10;SOVIET&#10;I-15, I-153, I-16-29, LaGG-3, La-5, Yak-3&#10;&#10;FRENCH&#10;M.S. 406, D.520, Potez 630, MB-152, Amiot 143, LeO.451, Farman F.222&#10;&#10;ITALIAN&#10;C.R. 42 Falco, M.C. 200 Saetta, M.C. 202 Folgore, M.C. 205 Veltro, G.50 Freccia, Re-2001, Re-2005, Breda Ba.88, Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, Savoia-Marchetti SM.81, Breda Ba.65, Piaggio P.108&#10;&#10;Scheduled Campaigns&#10;Italian&#10;French&#10;Daylight 1945&#10;Pacific 1944&#10;Soviet&#10;North Africa&#10;&#10;The aircraft and campaign list is still a work in progress.

Over a period of three days the apprentices racing through the realms attempting to earn renown in the minds of their teachers, but most importantly in the eyes of the fantastic creatures. Each student is given an Amulet, allowed the same three spells, and start their travels with an identical group of creatures who aid them with magical energy and fantastic abilities.&#10;&#10;The objective of Legendary Creatures is to win the trial and advance to the rank of Druid. Players do this with the aid of fantastic creatures who assist them in their quest for renown, whatever form it may take. An apprentice&rsquo;s final rank in each elemental realm, renown earned through great feats, and expeditions to distant landmarks determines who becomes the next Druid!&#10;&#10;Legendary Creatures is played over three days, each of which consists of AM, Afternoon, and PM turns. Players draw 4 creatures from their individual decks, then play 3 into their stable and send one on a solo expedition. Order and types of creatures determine initiative and resource generation for the round. Players then take turns selecting the realm they'd like to travel in, the resources they generate, and the spells they cast. This is repeated each portion of the day with a final expedition at the end of the PM portion.

The winner is the Club who most exceeds the expectations of their fans.&#10;&#10;The Football Game is a much about the football narrative as it is about winning. It captures the rivalries, the excitement, the back-page headlines, the stars, the emotion, humour and the occasional insanity and scandal of football both on and off the pitch.&#10;&#10;The Football Game combines our love of the sport with our love of tabletop gaming. It reflects not only how football works, but also how it feels!&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds, with one turn per Player per Round. Each Round represents about 6 weeks of a football season.&#10;&#10;During setup, each Player chooses a Club and is dealt a random squad of Footballers and a Manager. The strength of your squad determines your Club&rsquo;s Class (and win conditions).&#10;&#10;The transfer market is where you'll buy and sell Footballers in order to add strength and depth in your squad. You&rsquo;ll need cover too: Players may become unavailable in the course of each Match Day.&#10;&#10;Every turn ends with a Match Day Roll, where coloured dice are used to reflect scoring. Even the very best Footballers won't perform every week! When selecting their match day team, Players should consider a Footballer&rsquo;s Ability, Colour, Position, and how these might affect other Footballers in the team. Each Match Day influences the league position of all clubs, so you're never left waiting for your turn.&#10;&#10;You can boost your score through the use of Tactics cards played both before and after each Match Day Roll. Careful management of Tactics cards might be the difference between stealing the title for some, or avoiding relegation for others. These cards allow your players (such as the Wing Wizard, Ancient Attacker, and Incredible Sulk) to pull off elegant interceptions, lucky deflections, and wonder goals.&#10;&#10;The two twelve-sided bring about the fortunes and misfortunes that can affect any club or Footballer. You&rsquo;ll experience Injuries, Knocks and over 50 events including Social Media Mishaps, Night Club Nightmares, Academy Stars, Billionaire Buyouts, Sell-On Fees and many more!&#10;&#10;Victory points are scored at several stages of the season, and are awarded according to your league position and club class. Different club's have different expectations, so the winner at the end will be the club who most exceeded their fans expectations!&#10;&#10;Will your Players perform? Will your risk-taking be rewarded? Will lady luck hand you a lifeline?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "GMT's grand tactical, light-moderate Seven Years War battle series continues with four more battles in Prussia's Glory II. Players can enact some of the war's most famous battles in games playable in a single sitting. PG II hones the original PG system with some slight changes, and introduces Optional rules that further break out combat arms differences, such as Austrian Croat Sniper Attacks, Howitzer fire, and advanced Cavalry facets. The game also expands on the PG visual feast of Prussian, Austrian, French, Empire, Saxon, and Russian icon units with the Hanoverian-Allied army, featuring new heavy dragoon cavalry, and a striking red-dominant color scheme. Each battle includes one or more variants to allow players to explore historical possibilities involving larger/smaller forces present, or Alternate History battles that reverse attacker/defender roles on the same fields.&#10;&#10;4 battles are included :&#10;Prague: Last Day of the World&#10;The Golden Sun of Kolin&#10;Krefeld: Ferdinand Ascendant &#10;Inferno: Kunersdorf&#10;&#10;The new optional rules provide a richer mix of tactical chrome, while the selected actions serve to round out GMT's coverage of the war's most famous battles. PG I and II may also serve as a tactical complement to GMT's upcoming Clash of Monarchs, a card-driven, strategic treatment of the Seven Years War in Europe.&#10;&#10;Complexity 4.5; solitaire suitability 8.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;792 5/8&quot; full-color die-cut counters. &#10;Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color back-printed mapsheets &#10;18 page Rulebook &#10;14 page Scenario/Playbook&#10;2 11x17&quot; Player Aid Cards &#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zeppelin Raider: Imperial German Naval Airships is a solitaire, tactical level game placing you in command of one of several models of WWI Zeppelin dirigibles as part of the Imperial German Navy. Your mission is to destroy as much English war facilities as possible via bombing raids, or to conduct reconnaissance over the North Sea...and still survive and come home. Zeppelin Raider is based on the popular Hunters game system by Gregory M. Smith that delivers a tense and nail-biting narrative throughout the course of play.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to conduct numerous missions which include two main types: Bombing missions are required to bomb a specific geographic location in England (London, for example), whereas Scouting missions are required to scout a specific location in the North Sea. Players are not limited by the mission parameters for success; as you may choose to bomb or successfully scout somewhere else. The success of each mission can result in promotion and crew advancement. Just as in the real war, the game system involves a great deal of chance (as was the case historically), but ultimate success rests on the decisions, you make during your career.&#10;&#10;A strong historical narrative is presented without overly cumbersome or complex rules to memorize so the focus is always on game play and what critical decisions you will make during each mission. Rules cover mission selection, altitude adjustment and gas cell tracking, venting, emergency jettison, maximum altitude, dynamic lift, wind and weather effects, fuel management, bombing missions, aircraft and ship encounters, zeppelin damage, crew advancement, awards and promotion, reassignment to a newer ship, a special resupply mission to Africa, and much more!&#10;&#10;This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters or Raiders of the Deep. While Zeppelin Raiders is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player gaming sessions and organized tournament play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the game box:)&#10;&#10;88 is an intense tactical-level game of ground combat in Africa's Western Desert in World War II, the famous struggle between the British &quot;Desert Rats&quot; and the German and Italian Afrika Korps. 88 duplicates the strengths and weaknesses of the German, British and Italian units involved with 50 data cards that display all the information needed to move and fight. The game system, shared with our earlier popular Panzer game (which covers battles on the Eastern Front), easily incorporates myriad details such as armor thicknesses at various points, shots from various angles, heights, and altitudes, and the effects of terrain. The rules cover the important aspects of small unit tactics - armor piercing shots, small arms fire, high explosives, artillery barrages, air support, communications, turret rotation, gun depression, mines, roadblocks, barbed wire, smoke, and much more. The flexible scenarios cover a variety of combat situations that are resolved on the six-piece geomorphic mapboard, which also features movable terrain pieces. The types of units include infantry, anti-tanks guns (including the deadly 88mm), Matildas, Crusaders, Bren Carriers, Long Range Desert Group Trucks, Honeys, Grants, Shermans, M13/40s SEM 41s, a large variety of Pz IIIs and IVs, halftracks, and much, much more.&#10;&#10;",
