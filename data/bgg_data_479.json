The players supply the figures at any desired scale.  The hallmark of these rules is the highly detailed and historically meticulous system for portraying the various types of military organization during this period.  Units consist of variable numbers of figures and constitute infantry battalions, cavalry regiment and artillery batteries.&#10;&#10;Despite its deliberately &quot;Old School&quot; design (i.e., large-sized units, figure removal, historically accurate rules on movement and changes of facing), the rules use modern mechanics and so do not require the writing of orders.  Existing miniature armies need not be re-based to use this rules set.  The rules book is self-published but has been produced to a high standard of quality.&#10;&#10;*  72 pages including the color cover&#10;    * Quick Ref. Charts for large/small games, miniatures and/or tables.&#10;    * If you know the 18th Century, you can play right away with just the Quick Reference Charts.&#10;&#10;",

If you like dungeons and a dragon or two than you will love a game of Monster Quest. The game doesn't take days or weeks to prepare it's ready to go in minutes right out of the box. Monster Quest is a mythological board game that leads a player through a magical land of action and adventure. Monster Quest has 226 spaces on the board and 450 cards.  There are Spell cards, Wisdom cards, Map cards, Monster cards, and even Property cards that can be bought during the game.  The cards are one of the ways that a player develops their character.  Also, the cards give the player the ability to move about the land of Monster Quest rather than relying solely on the chance of the dice.&#10;&#10;There are 12 different parts to the game-board, a main trail that connects all of the different parts of the game-board together, a Town Adventure, a Dungeon, six Inner trails, and three Outer trails.&#10;&#10;Each player has a pegboard to keep track of their Hit Points (HP), Armor Class (AC), Platinum Pieces (PP), Gold Pieces (GP), Silver Pieces (SP), Jewels, and the Experience (Exp.) that a player will gain during the game.&#10;&#10;Monster Quest uses two sets of dice, two six-sided and two eight-sided.  The dice are used to Battle Monsters, win treasure, and move about the land of Monster Quest.&#10;&#10;A game of Monster Quest can last anywhere from three to five hours depending on the level of difficulty you wish to play.  Monster Quest can be played by two to four players.  There are six jewels in the game protected by monsters; a player must collect all six jewels to win the game.  Monster Quest is a whole world on one board where strategy is key.&#10;&#10;Beyond the City Gate treasure awaits in dark Caves, along Wooded Trails through the Emerald Forest on Shipyard Docks across the Black Sea to thirst in the Desert wandering the Foothills to the Mountains of Doom on your way to the King?s Castle to save the Princess.  BEWARE of the Dungeon on your quest young squire and if you have what it takes the jewels can be yours.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The games true origins have been lost but it is thought that it was first developed by McLoughlin Brothers in New York, though nearly every competitor produced one or more versions. Some, such as this version, bore completely different titles but followed the same method for play. It is a very simple word game best played with a large group of children, so it lent itself to social gatherings, parties, or holiday functions. The game consists of cards, usually small printed strips, with word groups printed, usually nouns. A leader reads the 'story' supplied with the game and when he/she encounters a blank, the first player to the left supplies the words from the card drawn. The play advances around the table, with nonsensical humor increasing with each blank in the story. Versions range from simple to deluxe--with quite complicated printed stories supplied. The game relates to other word games of its time such as Anagrams and to contemporary word games such as Boggle and Mad Libs.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The rules also include such &quot;chrome&quot; elements as &quot;How to Portray an Eighteenth Century Leader&quot; (Chapter 4) as well as rules for colonial sieges.&#10;&#10;The rules set concludes with the design for a campaign game set during the struggle for Lake George in New York state.  An area map is also provided.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "These rules are designed for fast play during an era of European land warfare across two centuries.  They strive for simplicity while providing a feeling for the nature of battle during this time.&#10;&#10;The rules are tuned to enable simulation of smaller scale actions rather than the large-scale battles that are more commonly the focus of miniatures rules but were more infrequent than the types of actions (raids, ambushes, assaults and patrols) these rules are suitable for.&#10;&#10;Given this scale of focus, the rules are designed for play with 25mm figures but may be easily re-scaled for 15mm.  Rather than offer army lists as such, these rules instead provide lists of characteristics of various unit types (e.g., gendarmes, landsknechts, various nationalities of shot and pike) by period:  Tudor Wars, Italian Wars, Thirty Years War, English Civil Wars, and Louis XIV.  Along with these lists, there is a system for generating armies based on unit cost.  A representative scenario is provided for each of the five periods of the lists.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ridiculous Vanity is a miniatures rules set that simulates European politics and land warfare during the age of Louis XIV.  It is really two games in one.  The first is a campaign game where the players are national leaders engaging in politics and moving forces across a map of Europe divided into areas with differing economic and strategic value.  The second is a set of miniatures rules for simulating battle from 1660 to 1715.  The rules may be used exclusively of the campaign system and vice versa.&#10;&#10;The rules do not require re-basing from other rules systems.  The units are standardized with infantry battalions consisting of 12 castings, two cavalry squadrons are 4 castings each.  The number of castings per stand varies with foot and cavalry types.  Armies are organized into commands and orders are issued to commands and groups.&#10;&#10;The book includes several campaign scenarios set for different periods beginning in 1660, 1680, 1690 and 1701.  There is also one battle scenario for the Battle of Utrecht, 1676.&#10;&#10;",

The designer has also been a consultant on several recent board games on samurai warfare and renaissance era Japan.&#10;&#10;The rules support two different scales of battle.  In the small scale a base of figures represent 120-150 foot or 60-75 horse.  The larger scale enables simulation of the biggest battle of the era.  Each base represents 240-300 infantry or 120-150 cavalry.&#10;&#10;The rules cover all the unit types of the era including Ronin and Warrior Monks.  Further, the author includes nearly two dozen classical Japanese army deployment patterns.  Besides the rules, the booklet contains extensive lists of leaders and their ratings as well as army lists, ten historical battle scenarios and a scenario generator.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rails of Europe is an expansion for Railways of the World. Glenn Drover, one of the two designers of the original game, has designed a European setting for the expansion, which uses the original game's pieces, tiles, money, trains, shares and rules, along with a new map and card deck. There are some rules changed and added for the expansion to reflect the new setting of the expansion.&#10;&#10;Due to the complicated corporate history of Eagle Games, this expansion was unusual - it was originally an official, yet unlicensed expansion of Railroad Tycoon. It was official, since the designer of the original game also designed this expansion and it was to be published by a company that is a descendant (of sorts) of Eagle Games.  The expansion is unlicensed because it never bore the Railroad Tycoon name, which was licensed from Sid Meier's computer game. Its status as an expansion of Railways of the World is much more official, although it existed before the base game of Railways of the World was published.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Black Hole Explorer is an interesting children's game about building a rocket to travel to and study a black hole. The game is designed to be light-hearted, educational and fun.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three steps:&#10;&#10;First construct your ship using what funds you have available -- $10 million to $60 million. Your ship must have probes, radiation shielding, gravitational strength and power to drive your spaceship.&#10;&#10;And, don't forget to name your spaceship!&#10;&#10;Next, travel to the black hole and enter into a low enough orbit with it to launch your probes.&#10;&#10;There are spaces around the black hole to draw Event cards that may help or hinder your mission.&#10;&#10;Finally, escape the black hole's gravity (which is harder than getting there), return to Earth and study the data from your probes. Did you gather enough information to win the Nobel Prize? The first player back gets to roll for the chance first. But is he or she fails, then the next finisher gets the chance.&#10;&#10;The game has competitive and collaborative playing options, and also information for playing the game with large groups.&#10;&#10;",

These lists include updates on the races and nations included in the original Warmaster book, as well as making some lists that had appeared in various GW magazines &quot;official.&quot;  In making the step to being &quot;official&quot; it also shows they have been play-tested and are, for the most part, balanced.    A brand new list, Araby, with magic carpets and genies, is also included.&#10;&#10;This list is superior in its presentation of the individual army rules.  Both army composition rules and rules for play, are boiled down to a single page for each race and nation.  Each race's spells are also presented.&#10;&#10;Armies included are:&#10;Empire (human)&#10;Tomb Kings (undead)&#10;Chaos&#10;Orc&#10;High Elf&#10;Dwarf&#10;Skaven&#10;Lizardman&#10;Bretonnia (human)&#10;Kislev (human)&#10;Dark Elf&#10;Vampire Count (undead)&#10;Daemon&#10;Araby&#10;&#10;This book was made available for free as a downloadable pdf.

A unique rule to the game completely eliminates any advantage earned of one player rolling better dice combinations.&#10;&#10;",
