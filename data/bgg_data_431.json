The cards are double sided and contain either: (1) different colored letters of the alphabet or (2) different colored objects (purple zebra, green triangle, etc.).  A color and letter card are simultaneously flipped over.  The players must quickly find either a letter that is in the correct color or an object in the correct color that begins with the chosen letter.  If you are the first to identify the combination, you get the letter card.  Any player that makes a misidentification loses a card already won.  After all 26 letters have been played, the winner is the player with the most cards.&#10;&#10;",

You get points for correct letters you've added, and you subtract points for errors noted by your opponents.  The colored pencils allow end-of-game scoring and adjudication of the puzzles.  Answers are provided in sealed envelopes.&#10;&#10;Seems like it would be fun, but you'd really have to love crosswords - working them with time pressure is sweet misery.  Six games can be played by four players with the supplied puzzles.  Refill puzzles were available in 1985 using the handy order form, but good luck now.&#10;&#10;",

The JUDGE gives 15 seconds (timer not included) for anyone else who would like THE RIGHT TO SPEAK to indicate they would like to answer. After the time has elapsed the JUDGE rereads the question back to the original player, the payer has 30 seconds to answer and reason (Yes/No is not sufficient). There is CRITERIA to determine if the answer is acceptable. The JUDGE, regardless of if the answer is to their taste, awards a LAUREL to any answer that meets criteria. A player may CHALLENGE a ruling and risk losing two LAURELS. Anyone else who has asked for THE RIGHT TO SPEAK may provide their answer. If they REPEAT what the first answer was, they lose a LAUREL. If they also provide a satisfactory answer, they receive a LAUREL. After a player has answered one of each coloured card and has 12 LAURELS they may predict even or odd on their turn and finish PHASE 1&#10;&#10;For PHASE 2&#10;&#10;As the player CLIMBS THE LADDER OF WISDOM in phase two, they must always contribute an answer on another players turn by using the RIGHT TO SPEAK TOKEN. As well, on their turn they must Guess EVEN/ODD before rolling. Being unable to answer or failing to contribute costs five LAURELS or go down a rung. Once at the top there is a final guess of EVEN / ODD to be declared THE GREAT THINKER.&#10;&#10;",

The hunting stone can be flipped instead of moving. When all prey has been collected, the player with most prey wins. However, if three blue arrows show six times during the game, the whale wins and the player loses. Depending on which arrow they spin the spintop with, players can influence the outcome of their spin.&#10;&#10;",
