If you are familiar with the storybook character, Corduroy, than you know the cute bear sketch that I am referencing. In addition to the bears, there are party hats, cakes and presents. The floor tiles assist toward shape and color recognition. I enjoy observing which/how many children count the candles on the cake(s) (there are five). And because there is a connection, via the character, to books... it is my belief that this game inspires reading...this set is best suited, for day care, preschool or kindergarten aged children.  It would be great in the classroom; especially with the storybook, as a compliment.&#10;&#10;Out of the 10 activity games 3 are non-competitive while the other 7 are competitive in which case the winner receives prize tokens.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "LOOPING is a simple card game with the theme of aerobatics.  Each card represents the side view of an aircraft completing a maneuver - climbing, diving, looping or some other similar action.&#10;&#10;The start card shows an aircraft taking off and to this players add further cards in a sequence with the smoke trails on the cards indicating where two cards can be connected together.  The card also indicates the difficulty of the stunt - and the points gained if the maneuver is successfully completed.&#10;&#10;Then idea of the game is to attempt to add cards allowing the aircraft to gain and lose altitude undertaking a variety of tricks on the way.  Whether the trick is achieved or not is determined by a die roll (throwing higher than a given number shown on some of the cards). Points are earned for a successfully completed maneuver. If you fail any part of the sequence then you score nothing.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the aircraft is brought in to land, through the laying of the appropriate card, at a level at the same altitude from which it took off.  The winner is the player who scored the most points during the flight.&#10;&#10;The game has three variants OVER THE CLOUDS (3-5 players)  DARE-DEVILS (2-4 players) and SKY-RIDER (3-6 players)which, though broadly similar, do make the game suitable for differing numbers of players.&#10;&#10;",

It was meant to be a sort of spin-off from Warhammer Fantasy Battles, to add a little variation to the game. Later it was published as a stand-alone game, though the basic Warhammer rules are still required.&#10;&#10;In PtG you take control of a Chaos Champion. You are allotted 35 &quot;Favor Points&quot; with which to build your retinue of chaos followers. Available are anything from Barbarian marauders and Chaos Knights to Evil daemons and the foul chaos spawn! Once you've collected your War band you set out to battle against other war bands in a show of might and power. If the Chaos Gods are pleased with your performance they award you with their favor (Favor Points), although they may even punish you, as the will of the Gods of Chaos are fickle and unpredictable...&#10;&#10;",

Therefore, if able, appear unable; if active, appear not active; if near, appear far; if far, appear near. If they have advantage, entice them; if they are confused, take them; if they are substantial, prepare for them; if they are strong, avoid them; if they are angry, disturb them, if they are humble, make them haughty; if they are relaxed, toil them; if they are united, separate them. Attack where they are not prepared, go out to where they do not expect.&#10;&#10;Each player commands a troop of 25 game pieces: 1 Flag, 1 Army, 1 Corps, 2 Divisions, 2 Brigades, 2 Regiments, 2 Battalions, 3 Companies, 3 Platoons, 3 Engineers, 3 Mines, and 2 Bombs. To win a game, one must either capture the Flag piece or defeat all the movable pieces of the opponent player. When two opposing game pieces are engaged in a battle, the identities of the two pieces are only revealed to the electronic referee system (not to the players) which determines the winning piece and the defeated piece. The battlefield consists of railway tracks along which the pieces can move continuously, country-road routes along which the pieces cannot move continuously, and bases which provide shelters to any pieces occupying them. On each side, the Flag piece is to be secretly placed in one of the two castle-shaped headquarters and guarded by movable troop pieces and unmovable Mines. Lively military figures, numeric numbers, and words in both English and Chinese are shown on the game pieces.&#10;&#10;",

The playing surface or pitch slopes down from the middle to the two ends where the players stand.  In the center of the pitch is a small indentation.  A ping-pong (table tennis) type ball is placed in the indentation.  The players each have one or more wooden shoots under their control, which they use to launch ball bearings at the ping-pong ball.  In front of the shoots at each end is a bar or barrier.  This is suspended just above the playing surface so that there is sufficient room for the ball bearings to run underneath, but not the ping-pong ball.  In the center of the bar the gap is higher.  This is the goal area where the ping-pong ball can also run underneath.  The idea of the game is to launch the ball bearings at the ping-pong ball and direct the ping-pong ball into the opponent's goal.  Play can be to a specific number of  goals or for a particular time period, with one to three players on each team.&#10;&#10;",

It incorporates several elements seen either alone or in combination in other action/dexterity games produced around this time - marbles, gravity, a spring.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with ten marbles.  Marbles must be placed on a large, plastic centrally-located daisy, which has vague depressions on each 'petal' for the marbles to rest in.  The stem of the daisy is a strong spring.&#10;&#10;There are 16 cards, all of which direct the holder to either 'put' or 'take' a given number of marbles from the daisy each turn.  Four are dealt to each player; a turn consists of playing a card &amp; following the directions.  If either the placing or removal of marbles causes the daisy to tip over, the player causing the incident must take all the marbles that fall from the daisy.&#10;&#10;When all four cards are used (i.e. when each player has had four turns) the pack is reshuffled and a fresh set of four cards is dealt to each player.  Play continues in this manner until a player is able to place their final marble on one of the daisy's petals without causing any to fall.&#10;&#10;The player who achieves this is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

There are also four categories of cards including &ldquo;Couple&rdquo;, &ldquo;4-Fun&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hot Stuff&rdquo; and &ldquo;Insights&rdquo;. When a player lands on one of these categories, they select the top card and answer the questions or follow the directions. If they are not comfortable with the questions or directions then they can select another card or pass their turn. Players will typically both answer any card that asks a question.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ascent is a game about getting to the top! It is a game of mountain climbing. Through the play of cards you try an attempt to climb the mountain choosing a route which best suits the resources you have available to you. You may choose one of five routes to climb. Each has its only difficulties and requirements.&#10;&#10;Through the use of card play you gradually climb the mountain choosing the best route available to you, surrendering cards as you climb. There is always the possibility of disaster as dictated by possible avalanches which can force you to start all over again from the base camp. The avalanche possibility is dictated by a nice system of die rolls. Roll 2D6, first is the route that is effected from 1 to 5, the second is the increase in avalanche likelihood. Each route has an avalanche dial on the board as the points amass on this dial the likelihood of an avalanche gets nearer. If the dial clicks around to the 12 position an avalanche occurs and it will knock climbers back to base camp who are caught on that route.&#10;&#10;Interesting game of tension and resource management with a fair amount of luck thrown in. Nice looking board and cool mountain climbers. Some strategic play possibilities.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;8 climbers&#10;Equipment cards&#10;Weather Protection cards&#10;2d6&#10;&#10;",

The Battle for Caledonia is a game where the Picts and the Romans go Head to Head fighting to either gain control 4 of the Antonine Wall Forts or to capture 4 of the opponents pieces.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 13 by 13 board which represents the area around the Antonine Wall between the Fort at New Kilpatrick and the Fort at Kinneil.&#10;&#10;The game play is via die roll. Players roll 1d6 and 1d4. The result is the number of squares you may move in two different directions but not diagonally. If you land exactly on an opponents piece it is captured and is taken to one of your own camps where it stays unless released by an opponents counter landing on the camp it is trapped in.&#10;&#10;You can capture a fort in the same manner. If it is occupied by an opponents piece that too would be captured.&#10;&#10;A fun little game which can be challenging and frustrating as you must use your exact die rolls and you must move! Can get tricky in the latter stages of the game! A good move and capture game.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Board&#10;6 Roman Soldiers&#10;6 Pict Warriors&#10;1 D4&#10;1 D6&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;",

The first function called the Territory Part uses a move value attached to Kicking, Passing and Running etc. which are implemented when the player has been allowed to on the FAC. The second function is the Action part which can be used to counter play determined by FAC's or indeed by the placing of other Team Cards.&#10;&#10;Tries are awarded when the counter lands on the Tryline by means of Running, Passing and Tap Penalties. If Kicks, Mauls and Scrums move the counter onto the Tryline then players turn a FAC to see what the outcome is on the Grounded Ball section.&#10;&#10;At an advanced level, once players become used to the basic game, Tryline offers you the opportunity to introduce Substitution Cards and a Yellow Card system.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Crawl into the skin of a Mesoptamian ruler during the age of the great Hammurabi of Babylon. Relive how kings managed to secure their power and gain the respect of their tribes. The construction of temples and canals, agricultural development and military victories can all spread your fame and secure your rule. Make constant decisions on how best to govern your land: rely on the rule of law and the gentle persuading powers of the Ishtar priestesses and strife for a blossoming agricultural system, or turn to the fanaticism of the Marduk priests and the battle strength of their troops. However you choose to exert your rule - you can only win the game if your rule is so successful that your fame, in the eyes of your subjects, has acquired a god-like status, making you the undisputed ruler of Mesopotamia.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is the first game from Hilmar M&ouml;hlmann and has undergone several years of development. Its final version was made available to the gaming community through his website and ebay. Having acquired a copy it is obvious that this is a labor of love. The design of board and cards is beautiful - the rules are well tested, clearly presented and relatively short for such a ambitious game. Ongoing support for players is in place through website updates and direct communication. And having just acquired my copy, I wonder if the price asked actually covers the materials provided. An impressive entry for this budding designer and a one to seek out for players who enjoy games like &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; but yearn for something a bit meatier and with a stronger theme. With an Arthurian themed game in the pipeline, this one-man act might be an interesting one to follow.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have the most military units and construction works of your color on the board. This can be done over 2 to 5 rounds. Resources can be acquired through natural growth, trade and military conquests. Trade takes place along caravan routes. Players can trade freely with their trading partner, pay toll to players whose territory is crossed en-route, or exchange resources against a set course with the bank. These resources can then be used to generate new buildings or units. Each turn a player can use an influence card, adding flavor and variety without unbalancing strategic play. A nice twist is that players who allow toll-free trading between other players if the caravan route passes their territory see a generous windfall from the opening of this trade route in the next round, when some resources are added to the storage in that province. Each year round ends with construction and military campaigns. Conflicts are settled by dice rolls which are modified by markers on the board.&#10;&#10;This game appeared in 2 versions:&#10;&#10;The self-published &quot;2D&quot; version (quality is at the very high end of desktop publishing).&#10;Some assembly is required, mainly joining the 8 pages that from the superbly produced full colour game board. In total you get 39 multicolour A4 sheets, including several photo-quality prints, six pages of clear and well presented rules, and lots of event cards, markers and game aids.&#10;&#10;The wooden case with the handmade &quot;3D&quot; version of the game board is fit for a king, and for those with a rather large game budget.&#10;&#10;",

However, in living up to its name the game board has a camouflage background.&#10;The ground units move and capture similar to chess pieces, but the three air unit types may jump over other pieces like the knights in chess. The bomber is a partial exception to this rule, it can only jump over pieces on its own side.&#10;&#10;",

When they have a convoy North calls 'Convoy' and the round ends.&#10;&#10;Any other player (not North) can halt a round by declaring their hand when they have collected certain configurations. Other cards&#10;include 'torpedoes', 'mines', 'cruisers', 'destroyers' and 'submarines'.&#10;&#10;After adding up the points the winner is the first to 1000 points.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to take tricks of balloons, stars, and flowers while avoiding the hearts.  The player taking the highest numbered card in the leading suit takes the trick.  After all cards are played, players move their markers ahead 1 space for each non-heart and back 1 space for each heart.&#10;&#10;The second game determines movement by using cards and a spinner.&#10;&#10;",
