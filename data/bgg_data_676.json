    "Description": "There has been a zombie outbreak! The cameras focus in a small town, where a band of clich&eacute; characters has holed up, waiting for rescue. It never comes. Worse still, the zombies continue to grow in number and intelligence. A conclusion is drawn: If the characters wish to survive, they must make a break for the outskirts and escape the town. Will anyone be left when the credits roll?&#10;&#10;PostHumousZ is a team based zombie survival horror game. Each player controls a single human character or horde of themed zombies. A modular town is randomly laid out each game, with the safe house at one end and the escape on the other. Likewise, every character and zombie theme is randomly generated by combining 3 cards giving each player, and team, its own strengths and weaknesses.&#10;&#10;The humans must move through the town to the escape, collecting items, rescuing nameless survivors (extras), fighting zombies, and hiding at strategic moments. Zombies killed by the characters are taken as points, and are spent to activate abilities and buy powerful plot changing cards (H-cards). The zombies in turn spawn and direct the undead, collect hunger (zombies&rsquo; resource) and use their cards and abilities to overwhelm the humans before they escape. Unlike the humans, the zombies&rsquo; plot cards (Z-cards) are drawn freely over time as well as purchased, meaning the clock is against the living. Gameplay is dynamic as both teams are affected by random events and changes in their opponents&rsquo; strategy.&#10;&#10;PostHumousZ 295 unique cards add near endless variation, depth, drama and humor to each game, while simple base rules and bold art make it quick to learn, easy to keep track of, and low on downtime.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;A perfect complement to Second Season Football for solo replay projects.  FastScore Football allows the Replayer to quickly play out a whole day's schedule of games, including realistic scores, in just minutes!&#10;&#10;It's a quick play game that generates the score of a football game with a few rolls of the dice. It incorporates ease of play, a simple ratings system and simple charts. Hundreds of simulated seasons are run, ensuring the accuracy of each Fastscore season while factoring in each team&rsquo;s strength of schedule.&#10;&#10;Although the ratings seem simple, there is a great deal of background information packed into each rating. This game uniquely takes into account the offensive and defensive styles of each team by separating scoring frequency and scoring ability. For example, some teams may score frequently, but fail to execute in the red zone- thus adding points to the board with field goals more frequently than touchdowns. Others may rarely score but efficiently march into the endzone- thus scoring more touchdowns than field goals.   Additionally, offensive and defensive strengths in the running and passing game are reflected in the ratings and will influence the score of the game.  For example, teams with strong defenses against the run will more effectively shut down teams that rely on the running game.  And in close games, give your team a fighting chance by going for a 2-pt conversion!&#10;&#10;With Fastscore football, teams will perform similarly to their real-life stats in points for and against, touchdowns for and against, field goals for and against, and most importantly, their win-loss record.  These stats are fine-tuned to a 250-season average typically within 10 points of actual, and within 2 TDs and FGs of actual.  Strength of schedule is factored into the ratings to ensure the utmost in accuracy.&#10;&#10;And the best part: we&rsquo;ve included the as-played schedule for each season! And we didn&rsquo;t stop there- we know that your time is valuable, so we&rsquo;ve calculated the final team ratings for each game on the schedule- taking into account home field advantage and the run/pass ratings- so you don&rsquo;t have to do the calculations yourself.  Just sit back, roll the dice and mark down the score of the game.&#10;&#10;Fastscore Football is played using two differently colored 6-sided dice. Each team has seven ratings representing offensive and defensive abilities and a clutch rating. Better ratings are color coded in green while worse ratings are color coded in red. Higher offense ratings represent teams with punishing offenses. Lower defense ratings represent teams that effectively shut down their opponents.&#10;&#10;If you play Fastscore as a stand-alone game, you can finish a season replay in a few hours! You can also use Fastscore Football as a complement to detailed, play by play games like Second Season Football. If you are enjoying a single team replay, play your favorite team&rsquo;s games with your favorite football game while playing out the other games on the schedule with Fastscore, and see how your team is doing in the standings! A week&rsquo;s worth of games can be completed in less than 15 minutes!&#10;&#10;Fastscore offers great value for the gamer. Each Fastscore set includes multiple seasons for one low price! We intend to rate every season from current day to the seasons of yesteryear.&#10;&#10;Each season includes: &#10;&#10;    Rules of the game&#10;    Scoring Charts&#10;    Team Ratings Chart&#10;    As-Played Schedule with pre-calculated game ratings for each team&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Israeli offensive in Sinai / October 15 - October 24, 1973&#10;&#10;Gazelle: Israel's most daring battle to cross the Suez Canal. General Sharon's Ugda (an Israeli Division) leads the offensive into Egypt and in a hard fought set of small fights ends up cutting off the Egyptian 3rd Army.&#10;&#10;Armored Knights: Operation Gazelle the battle of the Israeli offensive to cross the Suez Canal and invade Africa and cut off the Egyptian Army elements that were on the east side of the canal. This game focuses on combat at the battalion level on a scale that makes representing large battles real fun. It will also have its own innovative and unique way to handle the combat mutlipliers for engineers, anti-tank, intelligence, and recon elements. The players will find this does not always work the way they want and the support troops sometimes fail to do the mission they are assigned to do. They might even have a detrimental effect.  Both players will be challenged from the start of the battle.  The Egyptians will find that counter-attacking is very difficult as the higher command did not beleive what they were told about the Israeli positions on the west bank of the Suez Canal.  The Israelis will find that getting across the canal is one thing, holding the crossing is another, and spreading out across the west bank is another still.  Players will be rewarded for mixing the different combat support elements to enhance each attack or defense.  As happened during the battle the Israelis will find it very hard to attack Egyptian infantry alone or against their anti-tank screens.  Six scenarios are available to play the whole battle through the cutting off of the Egyptian 3rd Army, or just some important parts dealing with the attacks on Ismailia or Suez City.&#10;&#10;This game comes with:&#10;    (8) 11x17 Color Map Sections&#10;    (4) Color Order of Battle Cards&#10;    Approximately 600 Die Cut Counters&#10;&#10;(from publisher's website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Incredible Courage at Austerlitz - Telnitz is GSI's first offering on Napoleonic warfare. The game focuses on tactical level combat and maneuver during the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805.&#10;The game features variable combat strengths. Turns are 10 minutes of time. &nbsp; The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.&nbsp; Unlike other games at this level the rules will not be massive.&nbsp; Troop replacements are generated by returning stragglers to the battle.&nbsp; A few features are variable combat strengths, elite units, and levels of order.&nbsp; Units start with a certain amount of these and as they lose them their abilities are reduced.&#10;Buxhowden came down off the Pratzen Heights to attack the French right since it was so weak.&nbsp; Little did he know that while this was true at 0700 in the morning the Iron Marshall, Davout, would arrive shortly and provide the bulwark against which the defense would halt and then throw back the Coalition forces.&#10;&#10;Similar to the Death Ride series this game is the first of many that wplayers will be able to build into a larger monster of the Austerlitz battle.  Again critical thinking will allow the players to figure out the correct formations and deployment of their troops.  Infantry units are modeled at the company level, cavalry at the squadron level, and artillery at the section level.  The rules for this detailed game will surprise you with their clarity and brevity.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game features the 11th Panzer Division and some supporting XLVIII Panzer Corps units at mostly Platoon and some Company/Battery level and the Red Army (31st Tank Corps, and other supporting elements) at Company/Battery level.&#10;&#10;The combat system utilizes combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. Each hex is 330 meters.&nbsp; Turns are 2 hours long during the day and 4 hours at night. &nbsp;The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.&nbsp; Unlike other games at this level the rules will not be massive.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;This system features extensive use of obstacles (mines, wire, improved positions, and fortifications), a patrol rule, overwatch fire, air and artillery support, and reserve movement. &nbsp;These obstacles help channel the attack and force the Germans into kill sacks and forcing them to push through the heavy resistance to take ground.&nbsp; Overwatch is a type of fire that allows the player to move a short distance and then setup to fire suppressive fire at enemy units that might otherwise use opportunity fire.&nbsp; Reserve movement will allow a player to respond to enemy movement and move more units into a hex to strengthen it before an assault.&nbsp; Units are modeled to represent the 2 major types of weapons that most units have.&nbsp; Secondary (usually small arms) and a primary (main gun, machine guns, etc...).&nbsp;These weapons may fire at different targets if they want.&nbsp; They also effect targets differently. &nbsp; Suppression is also handled uniquely in this game.&nbsp; Units that are suppressed get a defense bonus since they take better advantage of the terrain in the hex, while at the same time they have their other factors reduced.&nbsp; Units are also modeled as needing transports and get the benefits of movement from them with the vulnerability that goes with it.&nbsp; The battle follows the divisions actions during the 10 days of the battle. &nbsp;&#10;&#10;The amount of armor in this game is astonishing.&nbsp;Added to the other 2 games and it's tremendous. 11th Panzer has its 2 Infantry Regiments and supporting elements.&nbsp; The game will also force players to account for Command and Control and Supply (expressed in a different way than the other games). Maintenance and repair are critical to both sides as this determines most of the replacements that arrive every morning.&nbsp; Troop replacements are generated by returning casualties to the battle.&nbsp; Lots of these casualties are minor in nature and both sides worked hard to get these wounded back to the front quickly.&nbsp; Air-Ground Attack can have a significant effect on the battle and both sides have a capability in the air to affect the battle.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The Germans were eventually bled white and forced to suspend Citadel.&#10;The German attack starts facing only the soft crust and outposts the Red Army put in place to alert them of the assault's start.&nbsp; The Germans have overwhelming numbers for this first phase of the battle and must utilize this advantage to make every kilometer of progress they can.  As the attack develops the Germans must generate fast movement through this area and break free into the tactical second echelon quickly to keep from getting bogged down.&nbsp; The Soviets must use terrain and their considerable obstacles to slow down and stop the Germans in their tracks.&nbsp; Stopping the Germans is going to be very hard. &nbsp; The Germans will find their force attrited slowly but surely over time and the Red Army will be slaughtered in the first few days and then settle down to the grind that was the battle.&#10;&#10;11th Panzer - comes with (in Full Color):&#10;&#10;        (2) Map Sections of the Pena River Area of Operations (maps N3 &amp; N4)&#10;        Supplemental Rules Specific to 11th Panzer&#10;        Order of Battle Cards&#10;        Task Organization Charts for Each Major German and Red Army Formation&#10;        Approximately 2000 Unit Counters and Markers&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pirati All'Arrembaggio! is a dexterity game in which you and up to three other captains manage your pirate crews and put those lazy marauders to work!&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to carefully place all your crew members (represented by four colors of mighty plastic pirates) on the correct colored level of the ship, determined by the random spin of a wheel. But be careful&mdash;the ship moves around a lot! If you cause any pirates to fall off of the ship, you have to take them into your crew, and try to get rid of them, too...&#10;&#10;Only the best captain will get all of his crew on the ship and win the game.&#10;&#10;&quot;&Agrave; l'abordage is a thrilling game of skill and balance for young and old alike, where anything goes. Your mission: Take over the boat by getting all your pirates on board!&#10;&#10;This is not that simple, because the sea is raging and the boat is pitching about. Some pirates could well fall into the water.&#10;&#10;To win, you need a little luck, but above all, a lot of skill!&#10;&#10;Beware of the wheel of chance which has many surprises in store for you with its barrel of gun powder and its skull of death.&#10;&#10;Be wary especially of your adversaries who are desperate to push you into a mistake.&#10;&#10;If you overcome all the obstacles and place all your pirates on the boat first, you win.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to take up this challenge and embark on the adventure?&quot;&#10;&#10;~translated from the box of the French version of the game&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "from the introduction:&#10;The Expedition Afrique&#10;&#10;In 1892, the French led a military campaign in Dahomey, the &quot;Slave  Coast&quot; between Nigeria and Togo, against its kings so that they might  have control of Porto Novo, a coastal city. They marched all the way to  Abomey, the capital of the land, and found the rulers gone. They  amused themselves by looting the city for souvenirs. The French press  was most impressed by a white parasol decorated with human jawbones.&#10;&#10;They never saw the inside of that parasol. Inside it was a map drawn  in human blood, a map that pointed to a legendary city deep in Afrca's interior. This city was called the City of Brass, a bastion of ancient  African civilization full of treasure, both gold and knowledge.&#10;&#10;Sadi Carnot, the president of France, sent a expedition on that  doomed journey. It only took three weeks for them to become hopelessly lost in an uncharted land. To this day, no one knows what happened to them. According to legend, only one of them made it, and his  greatest wishes were given unto him.&#10;&#10;In this game, you will play those lost souls. Trapped in Africa's interior, with a map drawn on a parasol and not enough resources, you  search.&#10;&#10;A note about the content of this game&#10;&#10;While there is no magic in this game, it is a fantasy. The nobility found  among the people of Africa is not balanced against the savagery found  here. Like all peoples, the historic Africans had both high nobility and  awful destruction found in them. Even though this game depicts the  negative side of culture disproportionally, the author is fully aware  that is not the only side, or even the dominant side.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;This game is a form of highly abstracted, limited scope role-playing game with a fixed set of characters and goals.&#10;&#10;Each player takes one of 6 different pre-defined characters: the Explorer, the Official, the Doctor, the Priest, the Naturalist, and the Native Guide.  A minimum of 4 players is recommended and one player must play the Explorer.  The Explorer nominates the Leader and the Leader selects a Companion.  The Leader narrates the obstacles that face the expedition.&#10;&#10;Each player must name their character (a French sounding name is recommended) and answer the question: what does your character seek in the City of Brass.&#10;&#10;Each character has 6 predefined statistics and each Ability has a corresponding Resource that replenishes it . The Resources are drawn from a deck of resource cards during play.&#10;&#10;The game is divided in 5 Acts, in each of the first four Acts there are 5 Obstacles.  The fifth act is the City of Brass and final scoring is done at the end of this act.&#10;&#10;Points are scored by defeating the obstacles and players may help one another during play, but are free to refuse help.  Obstacles are defeated by rolling a pool of dice against the target set by the Leader for that obstacle.  The number of dice rolled is determined by the Ability that is required to defeat it.&#10;&#10;Each player totals their Quest Points earned during play and plays out the endgame story.  The endgame has a blind voting/bluff mechanism that offers a point bonus based on player voting, bluffing is possible during the vote count.&#10;&#10;At the end of play, the player with the most points is the winner.  Ties are possible.&#10;&#10;",

Players make contracts with growers, sell coffee to their market, and improve their operation in order to satisfy the cravings of addicts the world over.&#10;&#10;On each turn a player does the following:&#10;&#10;1) Draw three coffee cubes from a bag containing equal amounts of coffee cubes. Add them to the demand meters in the center of the board.&#10;2) &quot;Make contracts&quot; with growers from the four corners of the world by moving each grower marker up or down on the contract grid in front of you.&#10;3) The growers then grow coffee. Each player draws one cube for each region he/she has contracts with. The amount of contracts made for that region as well as the type of cube drawn determines how much coffee you get.&#10;4) The player has the option to advertise specific types of coffee, thus potential increasing demand for their stock.&#10;5) Players then may sell their coffee, making more for coffees in higher demand. Selling coffee reduces demand for that coffee in their region.&#10;&#10;Because there is a set amount of cubes in the bag, players must balance supply and demand to stay on top.&#10;&#10;Fair Trade: A Game of Competitive Coffee Cartels is the first in a line of &quot;Green&quot; games by I-55 Games (a non-profit publisher aimed to provide workplace re-entry training in St. Louis).

When two adjacent starting railroads have fully developed their routes, the second stage of railroads opens up and dividends are issued to the first and second majority owners matching that company color.

A die is rolled to determine the length of the word that will score points in that round. (Ex. If a 4 is rolled, only 4-letter words score points that round.) Roll a bull&rsquo;s-eye, and the roller gets to determine that round&rsquo;s word length.&#10;&#10;Each letter card has a value attached to it. Some special letter cards have a range of values (Ex. 0 - 2) where a player gets to choose the value (0, 1 or 2) if that card can be used in a word. Playing at the same time, using their own cards, players have one minute to make a word of the determined length for that round.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players advance their tokens by the number of points in the word they made, starting with the player who rolled the die. Choose carefully. Your highest-scoring word isn&rsquo;t always your best choice. There are consequence targets on the board (red - always beneficial; black - take a chance) that can help you get to the final goal fastest.  Land on a target - take the consequence.  Making the best use of these targets is the key to winning.&#10;&#10;",

The four Aces are excluded from this and are called Muettes (the French word for Mute). Each player can bid which is really a search for a trump sequence. An example of bidding could be 'All the red cards' or '7s to 9s'. The only restriction in the bidding is that a legal bid must be at least 2 cards and no more than 24 cards. Once established, the hand is played. Note that there is no following suit, you can play any card in your hand to a trick and that the partnership, that won the bid, can nominate that each trick will be played High or Low (all tricks will be won by the highest ranked card or that each trick will be won by the lowest ranked card).&#10;I understand that one year after the release of the game, the author published a revised set of rules which customers could collect at their Parisian game's shop.&#10;&#10;",

They may choose from a pool of over 300 questions and over 100 challenges presented on the cards. The game also allows some space for inventing your own questions.&#10; Extra rules and an option of a reward for the winner makes the game dynamic and exciting! Additional tasks and duels make the game even more fun. Another thing is the special cards which you can shuffle into the main deck. They give you the possiblity of changing the questions, or even asking players about the details of their previous answers, or force everyone in a current round to take a challenge!&#10;&#10;",

Each card featured a picture of a boy aged 12&ndash;22, his first name, set of statistics about him (height, date of birth, color of eyes), and a list of his likes and dislikes. Cards includes boys from across the United States, from different ethnic backgrounds and hair and eye colors, including disabled boys.&#10;&#10;Game is basically a very simple matchmaking game. Minimum requirements for game are at least 9 cards, and each player should have pencil and paper. Play begins when players decide who gets to go first. Using the Boy Crazy cards (9 cards or more), first player secretly writes down which boy she likes best and why. Then the first player lays out the cards so everyone can see them. The other players try to make a match by writing who they think is the best boy for the first player and why. Then, each of the other players take turns revealing who they chose as her match. After the first player reveals her response, scores are tabulated for that round. Each player who correctly matches the first player's response scores a point. Play continues until every girl has a chance for her friends to guess her match. To start a new round players should discard starting set of 9 cards and draw a new set of 9 cards. The player or players who makes the most correct guesses wins.&#10;&#10;The game was so popular that Decipher launched a companion &quot;Boy Crazy&quot; magazine in September 2001.&#10;&#10;",

Features 'boasting' - a push-your-luck mechanic.&#10;&#10;Each round, an auction is held for the right to be 'big fish', who will have a better hand and should win more tricks than any little fish. Unlike other card games, you bid points of your score - being a big fish carries a greater element of risk, since you need to regain at least the points you just lost in the auction.&#10;&#10;A game lasts around 4-6 rounds, decided in advance. For 2 players, 4 rounds are recommended.&#10;&#10;summary of a round:&#10;- DEAL 6 cards to each player.

Express is a free Print &amp; Play game that is inspired by older, more traditional dice-rolling games, but distills the rules down into only the most critical and exciting elements. This allows for a quicker and easier game, while still retaining all of the edge-of-the-seat dice-rolling thrills that players love.&#10;&#10;In turn, players roll five dice and may choose to keep their results, or re-roll any number of dice up to two additional times, while trying to make the highest point-scoring combination of die results. At the end of their turn, players record their score on the custom score pad, and play proceeds to the next player. Play continues in this manner until all players have filled their score sheet, or until one player has scored 50 points. The first player to 50 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This version of the ruleset also includes bonus rules for Ja, See? Express Express, the fastest and most exciting way to play Ja, See? Express yet devised.&#10;&#10;A PDF file containing the rules and components is now available in the Files section.&#10;&#10;",

The playing pieces are familiar New Zealand icons which players use to move around the game board.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a booklet that highlights each of the organizations depicted on the board.&#10;&#10;Each denomination of the money used in Gumption profiles an invention that has started a New Zealand business.&#10;&#10;There are three different kinds of cards in the game:&#10;&#10;Risk Cards&#10;Players take a Risk card and follow its instructions.

The resource cards can be traded with anyone except the bank.&#10;&#10;Future Technology Cards&#10;Players can invest in research and development and buy Future Technology, which will increase their income. This is done once players own all the resources of one organisation. There are Risk Cards that allow players to buy Future Technology without first owning all three resources.&#10;&#10;",

You might, for example, climb Number One (Aiguille du Belv&eacute;d&egrave;re) successfully, and then try Number Four (Aiguille Purtscheller), and so on.&#10;&#10;Each climb is illustrated for the player, with various points along the route when equipment (Alea) cards might be asked for, the more equipment you have, the better for you. And the Descent (Rappel) might cause you problems.&#10;&#10;The board is very attractive, showing the mountain ranges. There is a curious box in the right hand corner, on which you place two tiny green frogs. These frogs move during the game and when they reach certain points on the track, the weather changes (Meteo). This weather change can be catastrophic. You might not to be able to get down a mountain you have climbed and a helicopter might be needed to get you off the mountain.&#10;&#10;The game looks great with all the Climbs being illustrated in some detail. The playing pieces look good but are completely impractible. They are plastic Picks, in 6 colours. And they fall over far too easily. And not to forget, the two green frogs.&#10;&#10;In my game there was a card asking me to buy their next game, which would be about skiing. However, I got no reply and I never did see a second game.&#10;&#10;",
