Each player represents one shipping and delivery company, and pawn is considered as a truck (TIR). After finishing a lap, player gets money for transported goods. When starting a new lap player may declare &quot;taking special cargo&quot; - which gives bonus money after full lap, but can be easly lost, when doubles are rolled. During the game player may buy the roads he/she passes. When the route is complete (player bought all roads of the one color - for example: H1, H2 and H3) each road separately may be upgraded (3rd class road, 2nd class road, 1st class road superclasshighway). Player collects money fees for passing his/hers roads from another player. Unlike in Monopoly Tranzyt's board is elliptic. There are also shortcuts, and special areas (AutoService, Bridge, Tunnel, Ferry, Parking, Fuel Station). When moving player throws three dice (two regular, and one special with only one dot) - when dot is rolled, some random events happen. Evens are listed in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;",

These card are placed left and right besides the gold seeker card with the backside up.&#10;&#10;In the middle of the table you can find the river, where to search the gold. This is shown by river cards, which are laid-out in 2 rows with 5 cards each. You can see the river, but not the gold printed on the other side of the card.&#10;&#10;If it is your turn, you have to turn a around a river card. If it shows gold nuggets you have to find the tools printed on the card. For that you turn around the cards which are next to the gold seekers. If you turn around the right tools you get the river card with the nuggets. If you do wrong your turn ends. After that a new river card is placed in the middle. If you turn around a river card showing gold teeth you don't have to find tools, but whiskey bottles.&#10;&#10;The game is getting harder, because every time a player shows a wrong tool, all players with a open tool card change this card with another player, so that the tools are now located somewhere else.&#10;&#10;If all river cards with gold are used the game ends and the player with the most gold nuggets and gold teeth win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A war game of a hypothetical 21st century US civil war, very topical with a dark twist on current events, a great conversation piece whether you are Conservative or Liberal. A mere four pages of rules means it&rsquo;s easy to play. Components also include a playing map, popularity track and three sheets of cardstock playing pieces. Two or three players ages 12 to adult.&#10;&#10;From the game background:&#10;&#10;After recent elections the Ruling Party gained control of the Presidency and a majority in both houses of Congress. They immediately set about to &ldquo;restore the promise of America&rdquo; through wide sweeping reforms. The rich were taxed. The poor received free health care, education, and housing. Big Business was regulated. The environment was saved. The civil rights of pornographers, illegal immigrants and underage children were preserved. The victory of Labor over their capitalist exploiters was assured for the first time since FDR.&#10;&#10;But these reforms provoked equally widespread opposition from right-wing extremists. It became obvious that after the next election the minions of rich Wall Street capitalists would overturn many of the reforms and renew their attacks on the environment. The Christian Right stood ready to poison the minds of school children with creationist dogma. Only quick action by right-thinking patriots could save the Republic&hellip;&#10;&#10;Play the crusading Big Government do-gooders or their gun-toting Conservative opposition. Each turn players can choose from various political actions as they attempt to &ldquo;save the Republic&rdquo; in their own way. Eventually martial law will be declared and the game takes on more of a military nature, as bullets instead of ballots determine the destiny of America. The game features overseas garrisons, militia recruitment, terrorist attacks, packing the Supreme Court, the National Guard, defecting government troops, air strikes, UN intervention, mass arrests and more as each side tries to &ldquo;restore the promise of America.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The rules are written from a darkly humorous perspective and the game is fun to play, a real conversation starter. Explore various scenarios. Are freedom and the liberal agenda incompatible? Can we avoid civil war yet preserve our liberty? Find out with The Second American Revolution!&#10;&#10;",

His mission is to demonstrate his superior prowess by garnering more mission points than the other players.&#10;&#10;Mission tiles represent the various missions that can be completed, including abducting, brainwashing or impregnating humans, making crop circles, mutilating cattle and being sighted in famous locations after dark, in bad light, by unreliable witnesses.&#10;&#10;The Vril counters represent special abilities and equipment that can help accomplish missions or hinder the other players. (And yes, Virginia, there are anal probes.)&#10;&#10;Players can choose to play as any of five of the more well-known types of aliens including Greys, Reptilians, Nordics, Nephilim and Elderbarians, with each type receiving a bonus for accomplishing certain types of missions.&#10;&#10;Alien Abduction is a hilarious game, that&rsquo;s also educational and fun to play. The victims to be abducted have famous names and any occult or UFO enthusiast will recognize the locations mentioned on the mission tiles and the concepts presented by the Vril chits. It&rsquo;s almost like a UFO trivia game, as well as a fast moving action game.&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly and is full of dark humor. I convinced my brother-in-law to play. He doesn&rsquo;t generally care for games and is not a UFO enthusiast, yet before long he was laughing and really enjoying himself. He actually won!&#10;&#10;The components include four sheets of colored cardstock mission tiles, one of cardstock Vril chits, a cardstock chit explanation card and a two-page rules pamphlet. Some assembly required. Dice, poster board, and some glue are needed to play.&#10;&#10;As an added bonus the game includes the pamphlet, Self-Defense Against Alien Abduction that explains how one might successfully defend against abduction by aliens through the use of various techniques.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trimok is a new board game for two, developed from the old Japanese game jan-ken-pon (scissors paper rock).&#10;The idea of the game&#10;&#10;Two players (White and Black) play against each others and they try to capture all opponent's pieces with their own pieces. There are three kinds of pieces: scissors, paper and rock. The capture-rules for White are as follows: white scissors take black paper, white paper take black rock and white rock take black scissors. Correspondingly the capture-rules for Black: black scissors take white paper, black paper take white rock and black rock take white scissors.&#10;&#10;In the beginning of the game each player has four pieces of each kind, i.e. 12 pieces in all. The board is divided into 6 by 6 squares and the pieces are set according to figure 1. The game is over, when other player wins the game or the players agree on a draw. The player wins the game, when he/she captures the other player's last piece or when the other player cannot move any piece.&#10;&#10;The moves&#10;Each player, in turns, moves one piece. The White player starts the game. Every piece can be moved in the same way: one square at a time in any direction on the board, i.e. forwards, backwards, to the sides and also diagonally forwards and backwards. If a piece does not capture another piece within a move, it can be moved only to an empty square.&#10;&#10;In the game is one special move, called return-move: When a piece has made it to the opponent's side to the last row, it can be moved back on some of the next turns, to its own side's first row, to the same column's or adjacent column's empty square. (There is at most three possible squares for a return-move.) When making a return-move, the piece can be exchanged for a piece that is not currently on the board. Making the return-move the piece can not capture other pieces. Examples of possible moves and return-moves are presented in figure 2.&#10;&#10;",

As such, it is sell-suited for all phases and all fronts except the trench warfare phases of the Western and Italian fronts.  The fundamental maneuver unit is the battalion, individual stands represent companies, and the game is designed to support division and corps level gaming.&#10;&#10;The rules include mechanics appropriate for that level of simulation including intelligence, engineering, logistics, night attacks, and morale and cohesion.  They also include elements that would be appropriate for running campaigns.&#10;&#10;The mechanics appear to be loosely similar to the Fire and Fury gaming system.  The game comes with detailed order of battle information for all the major armies and also includes information on combatants such as Bulgaria, Serbia and the Arab Revolt.&#10;&#10;Battles with Brusilov is published as a binder-bound set of loose leaf sheets.  It is available from Miniature Figurines, USA as well as from several miniature wargame supply distributors.&#10;&#10;",

They do this by declaring secession (consistently misspelled &quot;succession&quot; in the rules) and defending its breakaway move. Combat is conducted by matching cards and either &quot;battle&quot; or &quot;guerrilla&quot; tactics, which leads to gain or loss of support points. Play is varied by events (e.g. Sino-Soviet War), foreign support (from America, China, Iran or Western Europe), and betrayals. The Soviet players wins by playing all five reform cards (e.g. &quot;release political prisoners&quot;, &quot;purge hard-liners&quot;)and having no independent republics. The Minorities win by having at least three independent republics in play.&#10;&#10;",

Each Limit Card contains two numbers.  The top number indicates the number of scoring groups that score positive points, and the bottom number indicates the maximum number of cards in a scoring group.  So, for example, a Limit Card with the numbers 5 and 3 mean that players are optimally trying to collect five scoring groups with three cards each.&#10;&#10;It was released as a promo on BoardGameGeek in March of 2012 in an edition that matches the card quality of the base Coloretto game.
