If you&rsquo;re curious about summer camps, or have already been to one, you&rsquo;ll love this game!&#10;&#10;CampAntics is primarily for children from 7 to 14 years of age. The summer camp theme is also very attractive to older children, parents, and grandparents. Each trip around the board is one, very realistic day at camp. Campers decide how many days to play, and enjoy a social experience like no other. During a camper&rsquo;s stay at CampAntics, points are won and lost with the ups and downs of daily life at a great summer camp. Each space on the board relates to an activity that you would do at camp.  Some spaces will reward you for an activity and others will penalize you for let&rsquo;s say... throwing a water balloon.  You roll dice to move and each trip around the board is a day at camp.  You choose the number of days based on level of play. The winner is the camper with the most points (acorns) at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

While the new areas are dangerous, they offer rich rewards to those brave enough, or foolhardy enough, to venture into them.&#10;&#10;When you use the new board sections it is assumed that the builder of the dungeon has decided to protect his lair (i.e. the objective room) with an additional ante-chamber protected by some of his fiercest warriors. He has also built in a short-cut to the objective room, concealed by secret doors, which leads to another part of the dungeon closer to the exit. Obviously only a great, powerful and, above all, rich individual could afford such safe-guards, so the rewards you expect to find at the end of the dungeon are somewhat greater than they would normally be.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Legend tells of a square island where ancient tribes built 9 temples to 3 gods named Tiki, Taki and Troika. Every summer solstice the neighboring island clans send their finest warriors to the island to compete in a tournament. The first warrior to control three temples in a row will receive the Crown of Three. And his people will rule all of the island clans for the following year.&#10;&#10;In Troika (aka Tiki, Taki, Troika) warriors secretly choose Temple cards and Challenge cards in an attempt to control temples on the legendary square island. Temple cards are simultaneously revealed and if there is a conflict at that location, Challenge cards are revealed and resolved. Since Challenge cards do not move back to a warrior's hand until all four have been played, it would be wise to remember what the other warriors have played in previous rounds.&#10;&#10;Troika includes three versions of the game. &#10;Tiki - A simple and fast version of the game where the winner is the first player to get three in a row.&#10;Taki - Introduces Bonus Row cards that are randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. Plus the game continues until all nine temples are controlled.&#10;Troika - Introduces Temple Bonus cards. During the game players have the opportunity to take Temple Bonus cards that can increase, or possibly decrease their score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Across this land, the people of the world bow before their kings in the name of power and glory. What they do not understand is that power and glory need not rest in the same hands. Let the kings have their glory, if that's what they call it. Let their names be written down and passed from father to son for years to come. We care not for such things... for now.&#10;&#10;We are happy to stand above the stage in quiet darkness, pulling the strings and shaping the world as we see fit. We are the rulers of kings, and this is our land and in the end, we'll see where the true glory lies.&#10;&#10;Of Power &amp; Glory is played in several rounds. Each player has several pawns that represent nobles in a Western Europe that is ruled by eight Kings. Each Nobel may take one action per round. These actions may place the Nobles in the court of one of the Kings to garner the favor of that King, in a particular territory to postpone war in the area or perhaps hidden in the shadows to bring sabotage upon a King.&#10;&#10;After all player actions have been taken, the territories represented by the three leftmost, uncovered territory cards are battled over by the kings in order. Immediately after each battle, the winning King will hand out favors to the nobles that are in his court. Nobles my choose the form of their favors. They may choice, among other options, Power to aid them in the future or Glory to advance them into the lead. Once all Battles have been fought and the end of round actions are completed, the next round begins with players taking actions again.&#10;&#10;In Of Power &amp; Glory, each player represents a noble family in Western Europe during a period of war. The war is being fought among Eight Kings in the area. Players will need to aid the Kings in order to gain power and then use this power to help themselves, perhaps at the cost of the very Kings that gave them power in the first place.&#10;&#10;Of Power &amp; Glory is a Machiavellian strategy game that rewards foresight, deceptive sleight of hand, and investing your influence strategically to better your position amongst the other noble families.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The beautifully handcrafted, handfinished 17&quot; wood board is laser-engraved on both sides, with handpainted accents. The larger grid accommodates 8 pieces each, numbered 1 through 8, for the two-player game and comes with 4 octahedral dice that let you roll up to the number 8.&#10;&#10;On the other side of the board there is a 3-player version accommodating a simultaneous 3 player game with the original 6 pieces.&#10;&#10;MANOOVER PLUS FOR THREE PLAYERS:&#10;&#10;To play the three-player game, use the side of the Manoover Plus board that has three goals. The players are known as &ldquo;Red,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Green,&rdquo; and each has six pieces of his color.&#10;&#10;To start a game, each player throws one die, and the one throwing the highest number goes first. If two or more players tie with the same high number, then those who tie throw again. After the first player takes his turn, the turn proceeds clockwise around the board.&#10;&#10;The three-player game is generally the same as the game for two players. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of a control phase where one player rolls the dice that corresponds to the numbers on each of their pieces. For each number rolled they are allowed to move the piece in the direction it is facing or turn the piece one to the right or left. If a piece has been pushed/moved off the board or has already been scored the player gets one chance to re-roll that die. This is then followed by an automatic phase where all of the player's pieces move once in the direction it is facing regardless of consequence. Each player tries to get pieces (of any color) to enter his hexagonal goal near the center of the board.&#10;&#10;MANOOVER PLUS FOR TWO PLAYERS:&#10;&#10;This is the game Kate Jones created on the suggestion of a customer who liked the standard version but wanted something more complex. Each player has eight pieces instead of six, and the players throw four 8-sided dice to determine which four pieces to move.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The War Stories expansion contains 6 modules that are completely independent from each other. They can be added individually or as a whole to the base game. They consist of:&#10;&#10;War Stories: little scenarios that are written on a card, randomly drawn or chosen at the beginning of the game. These scenarios use tokens to add various effects to the game, like artillery fire, or to set specific objectives for the players, like trying to find dead officers on the beach. Some even simulate the rising tide or give the player added bonuses if they perform certain actions.&#10;&#10;Legendary Units: Now, every player plays a historical unit that fought in the Normandy landings. Legendary Units come with their respective Legendary Specialists and Legendary Items, which are always available, but only to their respective Legendary Unit. Also, each Unit comes with its own set of RWB bonuses, adding a lot of replay value and variety to the game.&#10;&#10;Poland: A 5th player color (black), with a full set of Specialists and dice (and its own set of RWB bonuses). This will give players either a new color to choose from, or the option to add a 5th player to the fray.&#10;&#10;Servicemen: The Servicemen cards represent individual infantrymen that join your Unit for a while. Each comes with resources: on every Serviceman card, 2 or 3 dice results are shown. You can discard the Serviceman whenever you want to add his results to your Final Tally (this might help you obtain some RWB bonuses).&#10;&#10;Last Man Standing: This module introduces a new way to play the game. Think of it as &ldquo;reverse D-Day Dice&rdquo;. You will be given a full Unit of soldiers at the start of the game, and then you will roll each turn to see how many you lose. Will there be enough men standing in the end to storm the Bunker? Includes a new Specialist (the Crackshot) and player aids with new RWB tables.&#10;&#10;Campaign Mode: This giant scenario allows for massive games taking place on 6 Battle Maps with up to 8 players (each copy of the base game allows for 4 players, so you'll need 2 base games for 8). The 2 teams race to the top with various obstacles, objectives and special rules in this fun and chaotic competitive/cooperative version of the game, where players try to hinder the other team while having to help it at the same time.&#10;&#10;The box also includes 6 Battle Maps centered around airborne operations (along with the Paratrooper Specialist, which now comes in a different version for every color, and the Pathfinder).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In addition to its 6 Battle Maps, including old favorites like Juno Beach and Utah Beach, this box contains 4 &ldquo;mini-expansions&rdquo; that are completely independent from each other. Players can add 1, or 2, or all of them to their game:&#10;&#10;Way to Hell: This expansion introduces the Sea Battle Map to the game. Now, instead of starting your game on the beach, you actually play the terrible boat ride to get there! Players take the role of coxswains (the landing craft commanders) who must dodge German artillery, sea mines and beach obstacles to safely deliver their passengers on the beach. Once they have accomplished their mission, the game continues normally on land, with the players taking the role of the Units.&#10;&#10;When playing Way to Hell, players don&rsquo;t roll every turn to see what they gain (like the regular D-Day Dice game), they roll every turn to see what they LOSE. All the Landing Craft start with a full complement, and must reach the beach before they lose everyone!&#10;&#10;Gold Dice: These are played like any Red, White or Blue dice, but take the color of your choice, determined during the Final Tally. The box includes many ways to introduce Gold Dice to your game, and optional rules to make the most of them.&#10;&#10;Special Missions: A simple expansion that adds a new layer to the game: Special Missions, which the players must accomplish in order to win. This must be done in addition to the normal objectives of the game (storm the bunker and survive for 1 turn). 1 Special Mission card is drawn at random at the beginning of the game, and the players will have to fulfill its requirements before reaching the bunker. Some will ask for specific Items to be found, or Specialists to be recruited (and sacrificed). Others will ask for specific RWB bonuses or even Awards.&#10;&#10;War Heroes: 25 Specialist cards with a twist... each represents a real-life war hero of WWII! They work as replacement Specialists with slightly better abilities, so instead of rallying a Scout, for example, you can now rally &quot;Scout Tommy Prince&quot;. The rules include a small bio for each of these exceptional individuals, hailing from the various countries who fought for the Allied cause, like Canada, USA, UK, France, Scotland, New Zealand or Australia, and from the many cultures inside these countries, like African Americans, Japanese Americans, Muslim Pakistanis, Jewish French, Maori, Irish, etc.&#10;&#10;",

Throwing dice, card games and beautiful components combine in this hilarious package, which is enough fun for the whole bunch! The game needed a stimulant substances are not included in the package.&#10;The game comes with a lot of cards, including regular deck (two) and special card decks. Game has 7 different adult games from drinking games (2) to actual serious adult fun with scoring and also a trivia game for couples.&#10;&#10;Trivia game:&#10;Game comes with a special trivia cards and dice. Players play in couples and roll a dice. Dice shows the category from which the roller needs to answer. The weird thing is that couple needs to choose another couple from which to give the answer for. For each correct answer you keep the cards. First couple that knows other couples best and collect 6 cards are the winner couple.&#10;&#10;Card game:&#10;Uses 2 classic game decks. Can be played with 2 or with 4 couples. Each couple gets a deck of cards or 2 suits in one color. Hearts and spades in this game act as trumps.&#10;Hearts are a life together and spades are the separation. Game is played in one full circle. With 2 couples the idea is to get rid of all the spades and collect all the hearts. Problem is that they both act as trumps, so getting rid of spades is hard, but there are special rules for Jacks and Queens in other suits that help to make that easier. When all cards are played, couples read their hearts and spades. Each heart is 2 points, each spade is -2 points, each Jack and Queen is extra 2 points (whatever suit) and each Ace is a free drink card (still a party game). Winner is the couple with the most points.&#10;In 4 couple game, game is played the same, but the winning conditions are different. Couples now only score how many cards they have - each red 2 points, each black -2 points. Rest is the same with the exception that 0 is the worst result. That means the further you are from the 0 the higher your score is.&#10;&#10;Couples game:&#10;Uses the special trivia game cards. This is played in circles, couples sitting against each other. When the times comes to a player, he/she pulls a cards and ask one question from his partner about herself/himself. Partner then writes down an answer along side with the question asker. When the answer are more or less the same, they score one point (a kiss or a hug). Game lasts 10 rounds. Couple with more points (kisses) wins the game.&#10;&#10;Other 4 are drinking games (one seems to be a sex game) where there is no actual winners or scoring of any kind. Like they say in the rules - all players are winners with these games.&#10;&#10;",

Something dark and terrible that has been hidden for eons in forgotten cr&egrave;ches locked in a stasis of bloody dreams of conquest.&#10;&#10;The Overlords are awakening from their deep slumber and returning to the planet&rsquo;s surface once again! The Gray servants of the Skvani are gathering their Tripod War Machines! The future of Mars bears dark days of war!&#10;&#10;WTNW is more than just a Victorian Science Fiction Game. It is a springboard for imagination and a high-level game of tactics and battles set amongst a 'what if' world inspired by the classic authors of Victorian Science Fiction and Retro Science Fiction.  In WTNW, players take the reins and command massive armies of men, fantastic beasts and steam-driven vehicles of leviathan proportions.  In the end, the thunder that cascades across the battlefield to settle in the souls of the fighting men will only be assuaged with the assistance of the landship.&#10;&#10;This Conflict on Mars supplement is not a stand-alone game. You will require the full version of When the Navy Walked, Second Edition, to play the game.

The goal is to inspire these young people for the economy, to lead them in mind as representing diverse economic decisions for entrepreneurs can be. It is primarily for school lessons in the region of North Rhine Westphalia thought. Thus it can not be ordered or purchased outside of this region.&#10;&#10;Players assume the role of owners of printing companies. They are advertising for their business, acquire orders that regulate the number of employees, advertise for public orders. They always have to make sure that the orders are fulfilled on time.&#10;A particularly interesting element is that, the pupils, beyond the basic rules, can arrange their own ways of dealing with the taks: by making arrangements, joint ventures and transmission of orders. The game length is variable. The game ends immediately when a company becomes insolvent.&#10;&#10;",

The winning player has the most points at the conclusion of the racing season (agreed upon number of rounds).&#10;&#10;Card draws determine racing team designation and order of play.  The player begins a turn by rolling a custom die to determine how many &quot;race&quot; cards to draw. The player must immediately use or discard all cards drawn.  There are rules that determine hierarchy among the cards. There are no choices to make, simply follow the card text and hierarchy rules.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Black Flag&quot; card causes a player to miss two turns.    The &quot;Go Behind the Wall&quot; card causes a player to immediately discard all cards until a &quot;Return from Behind the Wall&quot; card is drawn. It is a fact that in car racing the &quot;Black Flag&quot; causes a car to withdraw from the race for any number of reasons.  And a car goes behind the wall when it requires more repair than is allowed in a pit stop.  It is rare for a car to return to the race and some leagues do not allow a car to return to the race.&#10;&#10;The game comes in an appropriately sized box that is sturdy with attractive graphics.  There is a box insert for the components, the finger holds allow 1/3 of the cards to be removed. The cards are made from 90 Lb paper and have neither linen content nor plastic coating. The 1 inch custom die has images that are printed on the surface. The instruction booklet is in the list format without reference numbers and the order of the rules is not in relation to game play.&#10;&#10;",

Show everyone this sheet so they can read the rules.&#10;&#10;2. The Munchkin Zombies Water Bottle contains three swallows of Zombie Juice. Each swallow gives +1 in combat. You must actually drink one swallow for each +1 you want. You may drink it all for one combat, to get +3, or spread it out between combats. If you use the Munchkin Zombies Water Bottle in a game of Munchkin Zombies, you may drink all three swallows at once for a +4 bonus in any combat (individual swallows still only count for +1 each). You may give swallows of your Zombie Juice to other players, but be careful not to share Munchkin germs, or you might lose a level.&#10;&#10;3. After each swallow, mark off one of the three boxes below. When all three boxes are marked off, the bottle is empty for game purposes, though you should still finish all the Zombie Juice, because staying hydrated is good for you.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Manufacturer:&#10;&#10;Played like the classic Shut The Box Dice Game but with Letters. Say the category is &quot;Boys Names&quot;, You say &quot;Mike&quot; before the 10 second timer runs out, and flip the letter &quot;M&quot; down so it cannot be used again (by either player or team). Your opponent says &quot;Brian&quot; and flips the &quot;B&quot; down. Teams or players race back and forth in 10 second increments as they eliminate the available Letters until someone can't answer. It's high energy, fast-flippin' fun. The all new outrageous party game from endless games. Category name game for whole family. Recommended for ages 10 and up and for 2 or more players. Fast paced board game that anyone can play. Letter flipping elimination game.&#10;&#10;",

To set up the game, place the twelve treasures on their designated spaces on the game board, place the dragon's egg upright in its nest, place a pawn for each player on the start of the track, and place one dragon egg card &quot;sleeping side&quot; up next to the game board for each player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player first rolls the die. If she rolls a number, she advances that many spaces down the path. She can choose to go straight down the path or enter any detour path she wishes; if she reaches a treasure on one of these detour paths, she ends her movement and collects the treasure token. (If she had picked up a token previously, she returns it to its original location on the game board.)&#10;&#10;If a player rolls a dragon egg on the die, she flips one of the dragon egg cards to its wakeful side. If all the dragon eggs have been flipped, the player then flicks the dragon egg on the game board. Any pawn knocked over by the egg, including the active player's, is moved back to the location where it last picked up a treasure. If a player has picked up no treasure tokens, it returns to start. The dragon egg cards are then flipped to their sleeping side again; the egg remains on the game board or is returned to the nest, depending on where it landed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player reaches the dragon's treasure chest at the end of the path. This player wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Pyjamaparty players are little vampires who are flitting from bed to bed at night instead of sleeping. Yes, you might think that vampires should be roaming the halls late at night, but junior vampires need their sleep as much as non-vampiric youngsters.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, each player places her bed tile next to the rug on the game board of the same color, then places her pawn on a rug that is not her own color. Someone shuffles the six garlic cards and places them face-down on the game board, then players mix the spider and orange juice drink tokens face-down, place them on the game board, then draw one at random and place them on their bed.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls the die. If she rolls a number, she moves that many spaces clockwise or counter-clockwise on the rugs on the edge of the game board. If she lands on an empty space, her turn ends. If one or more players are already on that rug, she chooses one of them, then draws a face-down token and places it before her without looking at it. The chosen player draws and reveals another token. Each player then makes what they think is the appropriate noise for these two items hitting one another: &quot;clink&quot; if two glasses, &quot;oomph&quot; if two spiders, and &quot;splash&quot; if one of each. The active player reveals the hidden token: If both players were correct, they each claim one token and place it on their bed; if only one player was correct, she claims both tokens; and if no one was right, the tokens are placed face-down on the board again.&#10;&#10;If the player rolls a garlic bulb, everyone screams &quot;Garlic!&quot; then tries to get in bed because their screaming probably roused Dad, who will be annoyed to find them out of bed. Here's how this works: The active player reveals the top garlic card. If it shows a closed trap door, then each player moves one rug toward their bed (or onto their bed if they are already on their rug). If all vampires are in bed, stop turning over cards; if not, turn another card. If Dad shows up on one of the cards, every vampire out of bed loses an item while vampires in bed may take an item as a reward.&#10;&#10;When a player has eight items on bed, players hold a garlic round. If this player reaches bed before Dad arrives, she wins; if not, she loses an item and the game continues. Note that one or more players can receive their eighth item as a bonus at the end of a garlic round. In this case, these players immediately win as they're already in bed!&#10;&#10;",
