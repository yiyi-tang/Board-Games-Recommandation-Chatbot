To take a turn, you play one card from your hand, perform its actions, then put it in your discard pile. Some cards let you try to win the game by guessing your opponent's secret name, i.e., the card on the bottom of their deck). Your opponent may use a reaction, but then must tell you if you guessed right or wrong. If you guessed correctly, you win! If the card you guessed is not on the bottom of your opponent's deck, play continues.&#10;&#10;",

The prices offered by the ports change with each delivery, so you try to arrive when the price is high.  There is a lot of scope for blocking other ships and for bumping them back to their last port.&#10;So where does the Bermuda Triangle bit come in?  There is a &lsquo;mysterious cloud&rsquo; - a plastic construction raised from the board on a central column - which moves about the board and twists around above the ships. There are magnets on the underside of the cloud and on top of the ships, so ships can be picked up and moved or destroyed when the cloud passes over.  Each turn, a player moves a ship and the cloud - usually trying to protect their own ships and attack those of other players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sly Dice is a dice game in which you want to get as many points as possible by scoring various dice combinations. However, you can also bluff about having those combinations and hope that others will not call on you. At the end the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has three dice, a shield and tokens for marking. There are several combination cards in the middle of the table as well as three common dice that will be used by all players. In each round the starting player rolls the middle dice and then all players also have up to three rolls for their own dice, which are rolled behind player's shield. However, if you want to make a roll after your first one, you have to set one die aside, visible to other players. However, if you roll three times your last roll must remain behind the shield - thus each player will have at least one die that is not visible to others.&#10;&#10;When everyone is done with rolling, all players claim, which of the visible combinations they have. The trick is - you can also lie and try to claim a combination, which you don't have. When a player has claimed a combination then all other players in clockwise order have a chance to either accuse him of lying or pass.&#10;&#10;1) If everyone passes then the player scores this combination and receives the points it provides. If he lied and didn't have this combination he can now reveal this fact to others - he still scores the combination as if he had it and he also receives one Successful Liar's card, which gives extra points.&#10;&#10;2) If anyone accuses the player of lying, then he has to reveal his dice, which creates two possibilities:&#10;&#10;If he was not lying then he scores the combination, but the player who accused him takes a False Accusation card, which gives minus points. However, if he was lying then he was accused correctly and doesn't get to score the combination, effectively losing his turn. The accuser doesn't get anything apart from the good feeling that he didn't let the lie slip through.&#10;&#10;Thus each player in a round claims one combination. At the end of the round you add a new combination card from the draw pile and begin a new round. After certain number of rounds you tally up the score and the winner is the player with most points.&#10;&#10;",

The deeper the player dives, the more treasure the player can scavenge, but the more perilous the expedition. As each player descends into the dark murky waters, they will have to watch out for nasty sharks, earthquakes and worst of all, the other Divers!&#10;&#10;D3 puts a new twist on push-your-luck games, because like a co-op game, your planning and actions determine each others' success, but unlike a co-op game, all players scheme to get more treasure than the rest. This coupled with the very interactive Event Cards will create an engaging playing atmosphere that will keep everyone on their toes. It has shown to be a good game for families, girlfriends and wives.&#10;&#10;As the dive unfolds and the oxygen drains away with every gasping breath, will you remain as just another Lara Croft wannabe, or will you return with rich sunken treasures and maybe even the fabled Lost Jewel of Zakarra?

You have an entire school day (seven class periods) to make sure that your choice has the most Love for Hiroshi by date time. If you do, you gain Ki, and whoever has the most Ki by date time is ready for the date and wins the game. Along the way, you will control Hiroshi during the Hero Phase, and all five girls during the Girl Phase. You get to decide which order to take these phases each period, in order to make your story turn out the way you want it to. Gain Plot Points by fulfilling certain situations to boost your Ki and ensure victory.&#10;&#10;Watch out though, as other players will also be trying to manipulate the students to create their own favorite pair. Other players won't be the only obstacles to your success, as other students and staff members come along to meddle in the action and stir up the plot. Can you emerge the strongest and be ready for the date with your One True Match?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players visit locations in disguise to gain resources, perform arcane rituals, and hypnotize the citizenry...but most importantly, to turn hapless victims into fresh, bloodthirsty vampires under their command!&#10;&#10;To build your new order, you must manage a continuously evolving hand of vampire cards at your command, sending them throughout the city to visit locations, perform arcane rituals, bewitch victims, and recruit new vampires, all over the course of nine rounds (days).

It is significant for a number of reasons; it was the first time that the French army used a large-scale attack with tanks supported by a surprise (i.e. not pre-registered) artillery bombardment, similar to the British attack the previous year at Cambrai, and it was the first time that full-size US divisions went on the offensive incorporated in the French army. But most importantly, it was the opening of the Second Battle of the Marne. It  was not known at the time, although suspected by many, that this battle was the death-knell of the German army.&#10;&#10;French 10 Army, reinforced by US troops, had been assembled to strike the over-stretched German forces on one side of the Soissons &ndash; Ch&acirc;teau Thierry &ndash; Reims salient. The French had sixteen infantry divisions, including two US corps-sized divisions, as well as over three hundred tanks. The Germans facing them consisted of ten divisions, the quality of which varied widely although all had taken a battering during the Spring Offensive fighting. The German positions had been reached a few weeks previously during the final thrust of the offensives and therefore there had been no time to extensively fortify it; thus the battle was far more mobile than most of those previously on the Western Front. In addition, German artillery was sparse at the start of the battle because all of the heavy &amp; super-heavy artillery in the area had been sent north for the planned Hagen Offensive in Flanders, giving the French a roughly 2.5:1 advantage in artillery. Although the battle continued beyond when the game ends, it was largely over by the 23 July, progress after that day being very slow, which is why the simulation terminates on that day. The German defence at Soissons was skilfully executed, particularly as the attack had been a complete surprise.&#10;&#10;Decisive Victory 1918 is a series of three games that when combined will cover the entire Allied offensive in July of 1918 know as the Second Battle of the Marne.&#10;&#10;This simulation illustrates the main features of late WWI combat. If the campaigns of 1918 were a far cry from the static trench warfare which had characterized the previous years, defense still retained absolute tactical advantage over the offense. Even with the element of complete surprise and greater numbers of troops and equipment facing a tired enemy, the French army was unable to maintain the pace of the advance attained on the first two days. This was not through any lack of competent commanders: not only could the defender always bring in reinforcements in men and equipment faster than the attacker, but the attacker&rsquo;s speed, maneuverability, and ability to operate autonomously were still limited. It was very difficult, after the enemy's frontline was breached, to maintain any prolonged advance once the troops had progressed beyond friendly artillery cover and outpaced their logistical services. In addition, a few resolute defenders huddled around a handful of machine guns could inflict grievous casualties and delay vastly superior numbers. To adequately reflect these key aspects of late WWI warfare, the design incorporates elements and mechanisms that depart from the more standard hex &amp; counter systems.&#10;&#10;The game features mandatory attacks into multiple hexes, very rigid ZOC, and severe restrictions on disengagement and advance after combat. &ldquo;Threat zones&rdquo; extend beyond the standard 1-hex ZOCs and represent limited knowledge of the enemy&rsquo;s positions, thus preventing unrealistic infiltration through narrow gaps in the frontline.&#10;&#10;The Combat system is highly attritional, in terms of casualties and cohesion disruption. Reorganization is a slow process, conducted under the cover of the night. Attacking units rapidly deplete their offensive power. Defending units, on the other hand, are never completely eliminated, and retain (as &ldquo;remnants&rdquo;) indefinite residual defensive power. Defensive initiative superiority also translates into special &ldquo;fall back&rdquo; movement, which allows defenders to extricate themselves from dangerously outflanked positions and avoid encirclement.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the system emphasizes the need for proper coordination and preparation in order to launch a successful assault: Artillery support, effective command control, and a fundamental factor, most neglected in the vast majority of wargames, time, to draw battle plans, register artillery coordinates, conduct adequate reconnaissance and rest and resupply the troops. Accordingly, the system requires assaults to be prepared one turn in advance. Improvised, &ldquo;on the move&rdquo;, attacks are also possible, but are likely to be ineffectual unless facing negligible resistance.&#10;&#10;The Entente player will have to make the best out of his initial breakthrough, and be careful not to exhaust its offensive power too soon in order to retain some impetus for when German reinforcements move in to consolidate the frontline. Judicious use of his unwieldy and short-lived, but powerful armored assets is critical to the success of the offensive. The German player will have to conduct a methodical retreat, knowing when and where to give ground to preserve his forces and when and where to make a dogged stand.&#10;&#10;The game, playable in one sitting, has a low counter density and is highly suitable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Volume One: Soissons -  is a stand alone game that covers the French 10th army sector.&#10;&#10;Volume Two: Chateau Thierry-  is a stand alone game that covers the French 6th army sector.&#10;&#10;Volume Three: TBD - is an add-on game (with the previous two) that covers the Eastern half of the offensive.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Shiloh is a tactical level simulation of the largest single battle in US military history up to that date.  Before the two-day battle was ended, elements of of three complete armies totalling 100,000 men had participated, as well as elements of the US Navy.  At the end of the second day, over 23,000 men were casualties.  The battle ws launched by the South, hoping that the newly-created Army of the Mississippi could decisively defeat the Union Army of the Tennessee before it could link up with the Army of the Ohio.  Tactically, the battle was a Marginal victory for Union forces, although its strategic implications wee much more far-reaching.  Had the South succeeded in its attpempt, the state of Tennessee would have been recaptured by the Confederacy, and Union offensive power broken in the Western Theatre for at least a year.  A Confederate thrust into the North would have been by no means improbable.  The Union victory at Shiloh, more than any other battle, sealed the Confederacy's fate in the West.&quot; (from the Shiloh rules folder.)&#10;&#10;Shiloh is one of four games included in the Blue &amp; Gray Quadrigame set.  The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder.  A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.&#10;&#10;Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn.  Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control.  Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.&#10;&#10;A new concept, &quot;Attack Effectiveness&quot; is introduced in this set of games.  Essentially, attacking units that receive an &quot;Attacker Retreat&quot; result in combat are rendered &quot;ineffective&quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day.  This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs.  This makes &quot;what the heck&quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &quot;ineffective&quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Shiloh: Grant Surprised&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For centuries, the citizens of the Cupcake Kingdom have lived peacefully in a delicious dessert utopia. They've done so side-by-side with fantastical fauna, creatures with a cavernous craving for the choicest of cupcakes. Using sweet treats with the perfect blend of sugar, spice, and everything nice for each species, monster trainers befriend and tame these wild beasts. Feed them too many cupcakes at once, though, and they won't get the sugar rush they crave...but a terrible tummyache instead!&#10;&#10;In Creatures and Cupcakes, monster trainers compete to tame two magical creatures to show off to the Cupcake King and Cupcake Queen. The trainer who does this first wins.&#10;&#10;In this press-your-luck game, players pull cupcakes out of a bag. Every cupcake you draw advances you a space on each creature's affection track. However, if you draw two of the same in a row, your turn ends immediately. Even going bust has its sweet rewards as that player will get either a special power card with a one-time effect or a medicine card to help keep that monster from overeating next time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Jackal &amp; High, each player has three eight-sided dice, and with these he attempts to match the values of &quot;pack cards laid out in the middle of the table. Each round the players roll their dice and distribute them on the different cards. They can hold back dice for the next round, rolling them again then. The sum on a player's dice placed on a card must always be lower or the same as the card's value.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, all dice must be placed. Dice which cannot be placed go to &quot;Vulture Valley&quot;, where at the end of each round you can win an additional card &ndash; or lose one of the cards you already collected. The pack cards are then resolved as follows: Each pack card is given to the player whose dice match the card's value or who has the highest total on this card. If players are tied on a pack card, they compete in &quot;dice combat&quot; using only the dice on this card, with the highest total winning the card. Thus, dice combat might take place between one die and three dice, both matching the card's value.&#10;&#10;Special cards allow a player to collect more than one card at once, e.g., all cards which could not be won by matching dice in the previous round.&#10;&#10;Aside from a numerical value, each pack card shows a number of paws, and these are the real victory points. The player who holds the most paws at the end of the game is declared leader of the savanna.&#10;&#10;",

When pedestrians put coins into these machines, surprises await them as they open the packages.&#10;&#10;Strange Vending Machine is a fast-paced and light family game. Players choose which vending machines to buy food from in order to score points. If a player has no cash in hand, they can shake money out from a vending machine, so watch carefully and observe which vending machines have the most money! Strange Vending Machine comes with two rule sets: &quot;Muscle Man's Purchase Challenge&quot; and &quot;Ingredients and Recipes of the Mysterious Wizard&quot;. The two games have independent rule sets and cannot be combined in play.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Muscle Mans Purchase Challenge&quot;, each player has a vending machine full of food cards. During the player's turn, every one choose one of following actions to perform simultaneously: Buy a food card, stock a food card and take coins, take one coin from the supply. If the end condition is satisfied, the game ends. Score food cards in front of the players, and the total coins owned. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Ingredients and Recipes of the Mysterious Wizard', there are six vending machines placing on the game box. During a player's turn, the active player either buys a food card from one of the vending machines, or takes all the coins from one of the machines. Each food card is contained of an ingredient and a recipe. The recipes provide victory points in the end of the game, as the required ingredients are satisfied. Once a player purchases their fifth food card, all other players take one more action, and a Final Coin Shake occurs. Score the recipe points at the bottom of the food cards. Each ingredient may be scored multiple times. Each fake coin is worth negative 1 point. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Silk scarves. Leather helmets. The sound of the wind in the wires as you cruise over No Man's Land searching for enemy aircraft. Suddenly you see one, and put your plane into a dive from out of the sun...&#10;&#10;Eagles in the Sky is a 2-player card-based game on plane to plane warfare during the last year and a half of the First World War. Players each command a &quot;flight&quot; of 1 to 6 aircraft during any of several types of missions, including patrols, photo recon and even balloon busting.&#10;&#10;The game includes all of the major types of aircraft active on the Western Front in that period, including the Fokker triplane, Sopwith Camel, SPAD XIII and Fokker DVII.&#10;&#10;Eagles in the Sky may be played in one of two ways: individual engagements or campaigns, in which the players control &quot;squadrons&quot; and complete 5 days of missions, taking into account losses, pilot fatigue and the requirements of higher headquarters.&#10;&#10;Each engagement is 8 turns long, and each turn except for the first begins with a random event. These can add or subtract aircraft from the engagement, cause flak fire or other effects. The players then determine who has the initiative and draw a hand of cards based on the number of scouts (fighters) in their flight and the ratings of the flight leader. They then (beginning with the player with initiative) alternate playing cards to activate their aircraft. Activations can be Targeted against another plane or ground target or Untargeted (things like clearing gun jams). When targeting another aircraft the target can play a card in response. Depending on the planes' ratings and the cards played one aircraft may gain Position over another, which allows it to attack. Attacks are resolved by drawing a card and checking the combat portion of that card to see if the attack succeeds and how much damage it does.&#10;&#10;In a campaign each day begins with one player drawing cards to see which particular missions will occur that day. Players then resolve each mission in turn, starting by assigning aircraft and pilots to it. A given pilot can fly as many times per day as the player wishes, but each flight incurs fatigue, which will eventually exhaust that pilot.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved as engagements (using the base rules) or encounters, where each side's aircraft meet a non-player opposing force. At the end of each day, players reduce fatigue of their pilots, repair damaged aircraft and attempt to get replacements for any planes or pilots that have been lost.&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly; a one on one dogfight can take as little as 15 minutes, and even a campaign can be completed in a long evening. Components include a play mat, 140 1&quot; square aircraft counters, 176 5/8&rdquo; square markers, 110 cards and numerous play aids and record sheets.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Would you enjoy a relaxing ride on calm waters, or are you more into fast-flowing, turbulent waters? The player who enjoys their trip the most, wins! Unless you are not happy with your trip at all... Then you can try to flip the raft and win with this cheeky move.&#10;&#10;How do you play?&#10;In Roaring River you will move to a new River card every round, until you reach the end of the river or the Raft flips. Every round consists of three steps:&#10;1. Play Paddle cards&#10;All players simultaneously select and reveal one Paddle card from their hand.&#10;&#10;2. Raft direction and Danger level&#10;You determine the direction of the Raft by counting the total value of the revealed cards pointing to the right and the cards pointing to the left. Move into the direction of the hightest total. When the difference between left and right is equal or higher than stated on the raft card, you increase the Danger lever. When you have to increase the level at Danger lever !!!, the Raft flips and the game is immediately over&#10;&#10;3. Move the Raft&#10;Move the Raft according to the Raft directions determined in the previous step. If the number is equal, the Raft skips a row to go straight ahead. Remove the cards the Raft can't reach and place new cards in front of it. When the players don't have enought cards left to refill the rows in front of the Raft, the game immediately ends.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points according to their Motivation card, wins the game. But if the Raft flips, the player with the least points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each shift, one player is the manager and decides who has to do what. Together they try to satisfy some of the four customers that come to the restaurant. Employees are allowed to work only one minute because of very strong unions. Also due to the low budget, there aren't always wages for everyone, so not all of the staff wants to cooperate.&#10;&#10;In the end you count up your acquired little crabs &mdash; the only currency usable at McJohny's &mdash; and trade them in at the restaurant gift shop.

The game is played with a standard 52-card deck (or with multiple standard decks shuffled together with large numbers of players).&#10;&#10;Each player takes an even share of the deck as their face-down pile. Players take turns laying a single card from the top of their pile. If a face card is played, the player after the player who laid the card has a number of chances to play another face card (J=1, Q=2, K=3, A=4). If they succeed play continues as usual; If they fail, the player who played the last face card claims the entire pile. If, at any time, certain &quot;sets&quot; appear in the pile (usually pairs and sandwiches, but not limited to triples, runs, etc) ANY player may SLAP the pile and claim all the cards.  Even a bystander may do this and jump into the game. The game ends when one player has all the cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From session report:&#10;A card game. The deck consists of five  different colored sets of cards, each set numbered 1 - 8. There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.&#10;&#10;The cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.&#10;&#10;When collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.&#10;&#10;The basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.&#10;&#10;",

These companies may use all railway tracks in the Netherlands. Their only goal is to transport as many passengers as possible to their intended destinations. For these passengers the journey from Rotterdam to Amsterdam may well go via Eindhoven.&#10;&#10;Sometimes there is a sudden change of direction when the train has picked up more passengers, and a majority of those want to go to another part of the country. At other times trains may well skip stations when no passengers need to be there. And when a train does call at a station the passengers enter quickly hoping that they will arrive at their destination today. Is your train the one to be in? How many times they must change trains in order to arrive at their destination? Or will they not make it at all, because of those annoying obstructions?&#10;&#10;Introduction to the game&#10;In Koplopers en Dwarsliggers every player may construct up to three trains and each of those trains can transport up to 500 passengers. During the game you pick up passengers at stations and put their tokens at your train organizer card in the corresponding box. And then you try to transport your passengers to their destinations, after which you collect their tokens in your tray. Each turn you may spend five action points that you can use for constructing or scrapping trains, but you may also combine trains, split them up again, or reverse them. You can pick up passengers, transport them or have them change trains, and finally you can play obstruction cards or perform an emergency repair. The player who has brought the highest number of passengers to their destination wins the game.&#10;&#10;Some interesting facts&#10;&#10;        Koploper is a Dutch train type (see game box), but it also means &lsquo;front runner&rsquo;. The railway meaning of dwarsligger is sleeper, but it also is Dutch for an obstructive person;&#10;        The game board is based on the actual railway lay-out in the Netherlands;&#10;        The abbreviations used to denote stations are the official abbreviations used by the Dutch railway companies;&#10;        The designer of the game works for Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the main passenger railway company in the Netherlands.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The International Space Station (ISS) is a joint project in which sixteen countries are currently involved. The ISS is a symbol of what people can achieve by working together. Boundaries that seem so important on Earth take a back seat on the space station; what matters is a perfectly coordinated collaboration between the astronauts.&#10;&#10;Mission ISS begins in 1998 when the first module of the ISS was built. From your control center, you give instructions to the astronauts in space. At first only a few crew members are on the station, but over time you bring more astronauts to the station to add new modules, carry out various research assignments, or just drift in weightlessness. As on the real space station, the co-operation between the players and the co-ordination of the astronauts determine the success of the ISS mission. Only together will you be able to master the challenge of space.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the mechanism at the heart of the game requires deep co-operative play. To give instructions to astronauts, you combine two command cards: one of yours and one of your teammates. After you have performed the command effects, you place both cards on your own discard pile, which means that your turns always have an impact on the options of the other players. When you run out of cards, you take all cards from your discard pile to re-fill your display &mdash; but doing so brings the end of the game closer.&#10;&#10;Up to six astronauts can be on the ISS. Each astronaut stands on a base with adjustable values for three types of abilities: drift to move, carry out researches, and add new modules. Train the astronauts to improve their abilities so that they can manage all of the challenges on the ISS.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game detailing the Persian Gulf War fought in the early 1990's. Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.&#10;&#10;Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!&#10;&#10;Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.&#10;&#10;Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.&#10;&#10;All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.&#10;&#10;A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1914 is a traditional hex and counter wargame that attempts to simulate the opening phases of WW I on the Western Front.  This was James Dunnigan&rsquo;s second game for Avalon Hill. Like many wargames combat is resolved through the use of dice and a Combat results table (CRT).&#10;&#10;The players accumulate victory points by occupying 24 key areas at the game end as well as points for enemy units destroyed.  The Eastern Front with Russia is abstracted and the German player may receive victory points for deploying part of his initial forces there, and will lose points for invading Belgium, Luxembourg or Holland.  The player who most effectively wears down his opponent and holds geographical objectives will win the game.&#10;&#10;This game is particularly complex in comparison to other Avalon Hill games at the time.  Not only does it have a 34 page rulebook, use unit facing, supply line limitations, and a CRT,  there are also multiple options for fog of war (counters turned upside down or dummy counters), and step losses for units.   There is a short and long version of the game as well as cards for several variants.  Several options such as simultaneous movement and delayed commands require a third player as a referee.  The long version of the game may take multiple sittings to accomplish.&#10;&#10;While not an easy 'game' to play, 1914 is a rewarding simulation both innovative for its day and enjoyable to play. While this game is very different from other games from the period and has a couple of faintly tedious mechanics it is worth the effort and can be quite exciting to play. By today's standards we would like to see forced march and some command hurtles for the over extended Germans but one could say something similar about most old games.  This game does not allow players to ramp up a decided combat advantage from a god's eye point of view. No individual combat is decisive and one can only manage this not overcome it. The game needs to be played with all its bells and whistles (minus those requiring a referee) and when one bothers to do this they find an intriguing game of deception where planning pays off.&#10;&#10;For those who do not have the revision kit:&#10;&#10;Forced March:&#10;Each unit rolls on a D6 (as I recall this is limited to infantry and cavalry units)&#10;1,2 Cannot move at all.&#10;3-6 Gain 1 mp.&#10;&#10;The Plan 17 rule requires the French to make 6 attacks on turns 1-3.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1. 390 Die Cut Counters in two sheet (note: 37 of the 390 are blank counters.)&#10;2. Color mounted map - 27&quot; x 22&quot; sections.&#10;3. One Basic Game instruction manual (4 pages).&#10;4. One Battle Manual (36 pages).&#10;5.

Players serve tables by placing their time markers on them and ultimately the player who spends the most time on a table wins the table's tip. Players can also spend their time markers on the restaurant staff who allow them to use additional abilities to gain additional money or shift the odds in their favor on a table.  Of course, being super heroes, each player also has two (nominally useful) powers that allows them to bend certain strategies in their favor.

Capture  butterflies and deliver them to protected butterfly gardens in local zoos, botanical gardens, and museums.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. Players start each round by playing a card from their hands to determine the round's turn order. Cards are numbered from 0 to 59, and lower numbered cards go first. On a turn, a player captures butterflies from the field and adds them to the jar. When possible, players &quot;deliver butterflies&quot; from their jars to the different butterfly gardens to score victory points (VPs). Which butterflies can be delivered is indicated on the face-up &quot;delivery cards&quot; and players are often in a race to deliver butterflies to take the cards and score points. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;During the game, players must carefully decide which butterfly cards to play. By playing lowered numbered cards, players not only get a better pick of butterflies in the field, but they also get first chance at delivering butterflies. However, lower numbered butterfly cards usually have fewer butterflies on them, so players cannot add as many to their jars. Also, butterfly cards with special powers usually have high numbers, so you often must sacrifice turn order in order to use one of these special powers.&#10;&#10;In this second edition, the artwork and components have been upgraded. A major rule change is a new set-collection aspect of the delivery cards. There are now 4 types of delivery cards and players score a bonus for having a variety. Also, there are some minor rule changes with scoring butterflies in one's hand and jar at game end. Another small change is in the special powers on some of the cards.&#10;  &#10;The maximum number of players in the second edition was lowered to 5 from 6.&#10;&#10;",

In order to win, the player must reach the base TANGO 2 with at least two of their Leopard tanks, while trying to comply with the restrictive Rules of Engagement. Meanwhile, the opposition will use machine guns, rockets and tanks to stop the UN forces while its artillery tries to surrender TANGO 2. Any player casualty will be considered a failure of the mission.&#10;&#10;The game mechanism is based on a system of orders that all vehicles will follow until achieved or changed. All orders will issue from the commanding APC and they have to be relayed to each individual vehicle, which can be difficult once vehicles start to receive damage. The player will have to balance movement, defense and offense as the UN mandate has complex Rules of Engagement and the Danish government will not tolerate having casualties in a foreign war.&#10;&#10;The victory conditions are based on both completing the mission and the way the mission is completed, which depends on the player's choices, and is evaluated at four levels: operational (if the mission is completed), tactical (defeating the opposition forces), strategical (respecting the UN mandate) and political (respecting the player's government orders).&#10;&#10;The splendid art from artist Nils Johansson and SNAFU Design Team recreates the games rules as a magazine from the 1990's and gives the map and player aids the look and feel of the military computer interfaces present at that time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One player will function as Mister X, with the other players being detectives searching for him throughout Switzerland.&#10;&#10;The starting station cards are shuffled and everyone draws one to determine where they will start the game. Every move is either by bus, train, or airplane. Mister X moves first and writes his move in his travel log, indicating what method of transportation he used but not where he moved. Then, each detective makes their move, cooperating with the other detectives in an effort to close in on Mister X. Mister X only reveals where he is at certain points in the game, and the chase continues until one of the detectives moves to the place where Mister X is. In this case, the team of detectives has won the game. But, if Mister X makes 24 moves without being caught, he himself wins!&#10;&#10;Thanks to some added features and a new map, this localized version modernizes Ravensburger's classic game Scotland Yard and transfers the manhunt from London to Switzerland.&#10;Ski areas and boat routes help Mister X to escape...&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Scotland Yard&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players assume the roles of the detectives who are helping Commissioner Victor look for the thief by using tiles with suspects' faces. The player who matches the most features of the perpetrator wins. It will not be easy though, as each player tries to prove that their suspect is guilty and will disrupt other players as much as possible. Deduction and logic needed!&#10;&#10;",

To do so, they may first move and then play a card that determines what &quot;bundle&quot; they are buying.&#10;&#10;With each purchase, players will acquire seeds they are not looking for, so players are required to keep an eye out for open orders to make sure they make the best out of each turn.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, players may choose to tend their marginal land (not so fertile), in which case they won't be able to buy new seeds, but instead will be able to trigger a bonus action. In doing so however, players will end up with withered flowers, which will generate negative points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;At the end of their turn, players check the open orders and if they are able to fulfill any of them, they not only earn bonus points, but also get rid of potential negative points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s a place where we constantly look beyond our own physical boundaries to see what else is out there and dream of helping humanity get there one day. Each and every one of you make this place a veritable wonderland of dreams.&#10;&#10;My dream was to build such a place, but it was only an empty building before each and every one of you made it what it is today.
