And even crazy investors know that the way to make money is to identify a problem and solve it. The good news is that you have been hearing a lot lately about a problem that needs solving. The bad news is that you have no idea how to solve it. That is why you have gathered a think tank of innovators together (yes, these are the other players).&#10;&#10;Choose one card from each pile to reveal the problem. Now that everyone knows what the problem is, it is up to the innovators to figure out why it exists and how to fix it.&#10;&#10;In two minutes or less, each Innovator must draw a prototype for a new, creative product to solve the problem &ndash; without using words. When time is up, they will give you the prototypes to review.&#10;&#10;Choose two that you would like to learn more about. The Innovators that drew them get a chance to &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; their product to you.  After hearing the pitches, choose one product to invest in. The Innovator who came up with the product wins the round. Hooray! Give them in investment chip so they can keep track of how many rounds they win &ndash; because it matters.&#10;&#10;Now, it is the player to your left&rsquo;s turn to the be the Investor and you are the Innovator. And so on. The person who wins has the most investment tokens when you&rsquo;re tired of playing is the Innovator of the Year. Yes, they should totally put that on their resume!&#10;&#10;",

Recent events and new information has convinced the government that it is time to bring it down for study. Safely tucked away at Edwards Air Force Base (more commonly known as Area 51), they try to unlock its secrets - but there are some problems ...&#10;&#10;BEFORE YOU PRINT (a note from the designer):&#10;&#10;This is a long scenario, 208 cards. I tried a smaller size to save ink and paper, but it didn't work with a couple different scenes.&#10;&#10;After several conversations with other players, I would like to emphasize this point: There are several extremely difficult codes and puzzles. The puzzles are not technically needed to win, but solving them will help immensely. You will also miss part of the story if they aren't solved. If you are intent on solving them then plan on spending just as much time on the codes/puzzles as actually playing the game. Also, I have not offered any hints or clues on the forums. This scenario was created to be hard.&#10;&#10;You will need a device with a QR reader.&#10;&#10;There is no time loop--it's do or die.&#10;&#10;There is no combat. Challenges, yes; combat, no.&#10;&#10;It is playable with 2, 3, or 4 players (it will even work solo, except for one card that is not totally necessary).&#10;&#10;It is hard, but family-friendly in all other ways.&#10;&#10;It is long, and there is no good stopping point. Be prepared to use the save option in the box, finish in one long session, or have a table where it can be left out.&#10;&#10;Some duplex printers work better than others. You may want to try hand feeding paper for better alignment. A tedious job, but it often helps.&#10;&#10;Please be sure your printer is set to 100% not &quot;scale to fit.&quot; If the cards appear too small this is likely the problem.&#10;&#10;",

These represent the characters within the play.  Each character card has a special ability which are generally activated by die rolls.&#10;-     Death Deck.  These represents the methods by which characters die within the play.  Each death card has a rating of 1 to 6.&#10;&#10;To start roll 1D6 +3. This will give a random number between 4 and 9.  This is the number of characters who will die before the play is over.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 5 random character cards. These are kept face up on the table in front of the player.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn having 3 acts:&#10;&#10;1.   First Act: &#10;-    Draw 2 death cards. You max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;2.   Second Act: &#10;-    Place 1 death card on an opponent&rsquo;s character card. A character may have any number of death cards stacked on him.&#10;&#10;3.   Third Act: &#10;-    Roll 1D6. This is the Death Die. If the rolled number matches the number on any death card on an opposing character, then the character is killed. If there are multiple characters that can be killed, pick just one. A killed character and any death cards on it are discarded. &#10;-    The death roll will often activate the special abilities of one or more characters. The attacked player may respond first with the reaction of one of his characters. Play of reactions of other characters proceeds in a clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the pre-determined number of deaths is reached. The winner is the player having the most living characters left at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The deck has 9 suits of 9 cards each: Title, Attribute, Ability, Animal, Ally, Locale, Object, Action, and Foe.  Players are dealt 5 cards each at the start of the game with the remaining cards being spread out face down in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;In a sing-song fashion the leader says the first line of the Tarzantra.  The first player to his left gets to play a Title card from his hand if he has one.  If he does, then he keeps the card face up in front of him in his personal victory pile and he draws a face down card and puts it into his hand.  (He must also say the name of the card to complete the line of the poem)&#10;&#10;If he does not have a Title card, he must look at one face down card on the table. He may keep it, or leave it and put a different face down card into his hand.  If he had to draw a card, the next player to his left gets a chance to play a Title card to complete the line. This continues until someone plays a Title card.&#10;&#10;Once someone does, the leader speaks the second line of the Tarzantra. The player who played the Title card gets the first chance to finish the second line with an Attribute card. This continues line by line, until the full Tarzantra is completed.&#10;&#10;When the Tarzantra is complete, the player to the leader&rsquo;s right becomes the new leader and starts a new Tarzantra.&#10;&#10;The game ends when 5 Tarzantras have been completed (or 3 for a short game, or 7 for a long game).  The player with the most cards in their victory pile at game end wins.&#10;&#10;",

Thieves gamble their reputation with every expedition into the dangerous tombs that litter the land of Al-Shirkuh, but this gamble is worth the risk as great riches can be found. However, every thief must be wary as every tomb has a guardian to protect its riches; either a dangerous creature, or a fiendish trap to snare the unwary!&#10;&#10;How do you win?&#10;The game ends when one player has managed to collect 10 Treasure tokens from plundering tombs. If all tombs have been plundered the game ends and the player with the most Treasure tokens wins. If there is a tie for Treasure tokens then the player with the most Treasure and Reputation wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

These stats can go up and sometimes down with each player keeping track of the development of his civilization on a record sheet.&#10;&#10;There are 13 common tracks, one of which (the Pre-History track) is used in the pre-game, the other 12 during the main game. Most tracks are 13 spaces long, including the start space, and circular in nature so that players can move their markers round them in a continuous loop. The 13 tracks are:&#10;Pre-History Track (for pre-game only)&#10;Knowledge Track&#10;Military Track&#10;Cultural Track&#10;Agriculture Track&#10;Industry Track&#10;Building Track&#10;Wonder Track&#10;Religion Track&#10;Government Track&#10;Leader Track&#10;Trade Track&#10;Naval Track&#10;There are also several charts which are referenced from various points on the tracks.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with 5 points in Population, Territory, Food, Stability, Zeal, Military, and Culture. They also receive additional starting stats through the pre-game phase.&#10;&#10;During the pre-game phase players place one pawn each on the start space of the Pre-History track which has 23 spaces (including the start).  Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawns forward along the track. When a player lands on a space they get the indicated boosts to their stats. They also put a marker on the space. If a player lands on a space that already has a marker they move to any space of their choice. When every space on the Pre-History Track has been marked the pre-game ends.&#10;&#10;During the main game turns are conducted over a series of 16 phases, with players taking turns within each phase.  During most phases each player will roll one die and move along the indicated track (i.e. during the leader phase, players move on the leader track). Players gets the stat bonuses as described in the space they land on. Certain phases allow players to increase population size in exchange for resources, trade with other players, or declare war on other players in an attempt to steal territory from them.&#10;&#10;The game ends when anyone reaches 20 or more territories. If a player ever goes to zero territory or population he automatically loses.  At the end of the game, the player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2 players based on the Highlander Movies and TV shows. The game depicts two Immortals engaging in a duel.&#10;&#10;Each player picks a pre-made Immortal (from a choice of three) or makes their own by rolling dice for stats. Each Immortal has 12 basic stats: Wits, Will, Courage, Strength, Skill, Reflexes, Agility, Endurance, Initiative, Experience, Judgement and Size.  The average Immortal will have a score in each between 4 and 9. Each Immortal starts with a number of Life Points = 15 + Endurance.&#10;&#10;Immortals are armed with swords, and players can select from a choice of 9 different types.  Each sword has 5 stats: Sharpness, Impact, Speed, Guard and Length. These also have scores between 4 and 9.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck formed from 5 different cards types: Attack, Defence, Both (can be used for either Attack or Defence), State, Early Event Card and Late Event Card.  Combat cards (Attack, Defence or Both) generate the indicated amount of Force - this will usually be a number between 2 and 9. Some combat cards list their Force as a Stat (Immortal or Sword). In this case use your Immortal&rsquo;s or sword&rsquo;s stat value as that of the combat card.&#10;&#10;Before combat players must chose a location (from a choice of 8). They can agree on one or choose randomly. Most locations will have special rules that modify the combat.&#10;&#10;Each turn has 7 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Draw Phase&#10;-    Each player fills their hand to 5 cards.  If one Immortal has more Experience than his opponent, he fills his hand to 6 cards.&#10;&#10;2.   Initiative Phase&#10;-    Players roll one die each and add their Initiative Stat. The higher total wins the Initiative. If tied, roll again.&#10;&#10;3.   Early Event Phase&#10;-    Players take turns playing Early Event cards and State cards.  The initiative winner chooses whether to go first or last.&#10;&#10;4.   First Combat Phase&#10;-    The Initiative winner may play an Attack card (or use a Both card as an attack card).  The other player may play a Defence (or Both) card. If the Force of the Attack card is higher the defender takes damage equal to the difference.&#10;&#10;5.   Last Combat Phase&#10;-    The Initiative loser may play an Attack card (or use a Both card as an attack card). The other player may play a Defence (or Both) card. If the Force of the Attack card is higher the defender takes damage equal to the difference.&#10;&#10;6.   Late Event Phase&#10;-    Players take turns playing Late Event cards. The initiative winner chooses whether to go first or last.&#10;&#10;7.   End Phase&#10;-    Players may discard down to 2 cards.  The player with the higher Judgement score may discard down to 1 card.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player that kills his opponent&rsquo;s Immortal.  To do this you must first reduce his Life points to zero. Next, you must do extra damage to him with a decapitation card.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Furioso is a set of wargames rules that covers European warfare in the sixteenth century. The rules allow players to fight large scale land battles with a simple to use and enjoyable gaming system.&#10;&#10;Already the nature of pike &amp; shot warfare that would dominate the seventeenth century was already beginning to take shape by the end of this period. Furioso is designed to re-create large scale battles such as those fought at Fornovo, Cerignola, Bicocca, Dreux, Moncontour, Clontibret, Yellow Ford, Ivry.&#10;&#10;Players will find themselves commanding (or at least trying to command) the armies of the period. Players will quickly realise that some of their forces have minds of their own. Gendarmes are likely to charge off at the earliest opportunity - even if this means an entirely unsuitable enemy in terrain not exactly suited to the fully armoured knight.&#10;&#10;Players may wish to try and soften up an enemy before unleashing their Swiss pike squares but they will rarely get the opportunity. Impatient Swiss units are likely to have closed with the enemy before a cannon shot is fired - even if that means charging across terrain that is likely to disorder their densely packed ranks. More defensive minded players can protect their armies with extensive earthworks that will disrupt the enemies attack and provide valuable cover from enemy fire. However, players may find that the enemy are not happy to wait for these constructions to be completed and will launch surprise attacks before such works are finished. And of course, in a time when increasing numbers of mercenaries where employed, players will need to make sure that sufficient care is taken to avoid last minute pay disputes, strikes, mutiny&rsquo;s and all of the other trials that would complicate the lives of sixteenth century commanders.&#10;&#10;Furioso can be fought using any scale figures from 6mm to 28mm. The rules themselves have a very simple system at their heart. If you want to do anything you need to roll a d6, a score of five or more will achieve success, a score of four or lower means failure. Modifiers are applied but this is to the number of dice rolled to achieve success and not the score required. Success will therefore be measured by the number of successful scores achieved. At the start of a turn, players will roll one Initiative die for each unit, better quality and motivated units will receive a bonus to this score, poor quality unit&rsquo;s a deduction. Units will be activated in sequence with the highest scoring unit going first followed buy lower scoring units - and units that score zero or less won&rsquo;t be doing anything! This means that play will pass from unit to unit rather than one side activating all of their units and then the opposing side activating all of theirs. The result of this kind of mechanic means that players will have less control over their overall force and may find it difficult to execute a strategic plan - but in a period when many commanders would be personally leading their troops in to battle and fighting sword in hand in the front rank - that seems like an entirely realistic ambition for the period.&#10;&#10;Also included in the rules is a series of random events of Hazards that cover such situations as Swiss troops striking over pay, raiding cavalry stealing an armies baggage and a whole host of other misfortunes that commonly befell armies of the period. To the rear of the rules are a number of army lists for all of the major armies of the period. Also included are unit cards for all of these units which you can copy for use. These will be used during the deployment phase of the battle so that opposing armies will have only a limited idea of their opponents composition and dispositions. And finally, we hope you enjoy playing these rules. Our intention with this game is to provide a fun and entertaining way to explore the tactical changes and challenges of the period with a healthy dose of &lsquo;period-feel&rsquo; thrown in for good measure.&#10;&#10;",

Once the collected path cards add up to a value equal to or greater than the target number found on the entrance card, the job is complete and the player is allowed to take the top loot card from the community loot pile.&#10;&#10;However, not all path cards are positive ones. Your opponents will play negative path cards, along with a myriad of different trick cards, in order to make sure that they are the ones finishing their own jobs and grabbing the best loot before you can.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the designer:&#10;&#10;The time is October 1962.  The players, representing Kennedy , Khrushchev, and Castro, must try to survive each of the 5 Rounds of the Cuban Missile Crisis while gaining more prestige than your opponents. The game consists of three phases in each of the five Rounds:  Decision Phase, Conflict Phase, and Resolution Phase.  The US and Soviet players will use &ldquo;brinkmanship&rdquo; as they commit resources during the Decision Phase, in which they try to gain an advantage without resulting in a confrontation (referred to in the rules as a Deadlock or Stalemate). During the Conflict Phase, there is a danger that DEFCON 1 might be reached which means imminent nuclear war in which all sides will lose prestige (victory points).  Only if the contestants can work their way successfully through the Conflict phase, without triggering a nuclear war, will they score victory points (prestige) in the Round.&#10;&#10;During each Round, each player is required to make one major decision. Then, through the use of tactical cards, the Kennedy and Khrushchev players may make a few further crucial decisions to best implement their chosen strategy for the Round.  ANY of these Decisions have the capacity to trigger the disaster of Nuclear War, which results in the loss of prestige or victory points (not to mention human life).  Be careful!  Who is willing to push the envelope to the brink of disaster in an effort to emerge from the crisis as the world&rsquo;s dominant power? &#10;Decision Phase: &#10;&#10;     Each player secretly decides what their &ldquo;bid&rdquo; will be by choosing any number of their cubes.&#10;     When the bids are revealed, the player with the most bid cubes, in this pool, is declared the &ldquo;initial bid winner&quot;, which will increase his chances of ultimate victory in the Round, but also increase the chances of nuclear war if his bid is greatly higher than his opponent.  So each side must push the envelope, but must be restrained as well, so as not to trigger global nuclear war.&#10;     If the bids are the same amount, the Round immediately ends    with neither side gaining any prestige. &#10;&#10;&#10;Conflict Phase:&#10;&#10;     If the players survive the Decision phase they will enter the Conflict phase, where their bids will be resolved to see how much each side earns in prestige (victory points) During this phase Tactic cards can be played in order to better position themselves in determining the outcome of the conflict. It is also during this phase that there is a greater chance of pushing your opponent into a &quot;DEFCON 1&quot; mode which will automatically result in the loss of most of the accumulated victory points from the previous Rounds, and may end the game in full nuclear war, where everyone loses!&#10;&#10;&#10;The tactics cards represent actual historical events of the period. This micro-game is designed to accurately reflect a brief history of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The entire game can be played within 15 to 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

Heroes start on the player&rsquo;s back row of the board. Team IRON goes first&#10;&#10;A regular 52 card playing deck is used as an action deck.  Each Hero has his own action table which describes 10 numbered actions that Hero can take &ndash; these correspond to the 1 (ace) &ndash; 10 cards in the deck.  Action are of 4 types: Attack, Defence, Movement or Special.  A King card can be used to have a friendly Hero attack an adjacent enemy Hero. A Queen card can be used to move a friendly Hero 1 or 2 spaces. Black Jack cards can be used for Witty Repartee: A Friendly Hero and an enemy Hero within 2 spaces of each other may neither move nor attack the rest of this turn. Red Jack cards can be used to Taunt:  A Friendly Hero causes an enemy Hero within 2 spaces to want to attack him or her. That Hero can attack no other Heroes the rest of this or next turn.&#10;&#10;First, each player fills their hand to 6 cards. Players then take turns playing 1 card at a time to cause their heroes to: Move, Attack, and Defend. Attack values indicate the range of the attack emanating from that Hero. Movement values indicate how far the Hero will move. A Defence Action will negate an attack just made by an enemy Hero against this hero. Played cards are discarded. &#10;If a player has no cards left, or nothing he wants to do, he may pass. A player who passes may play no other cards this turn except Defence cards. When both players have passed the turn ends. &#10;Heroes may not end their turns in the same space as another hero however, they may move or attack through (past) other Heroes.  &#10; Each hero has 5 Hit Points (HP). Every time a hero gets attacked and does not defend, it loses 1 HP. If a Hero is reduced to zero HP that Hero is knocked out and removed from play&#10;&#10;At the end of turn 12 if both Cap and Bucky are still in play, team CAP wins, otherwise team IRON Wins.&#10;&#10;",

This produces a result that that depends on the type of card you discard (i.e. if you discard an Alice card you may draw 3 cards and keep 1, discarding an Ally card allows you to draw 2 cards &#10;     Meld Phase: To make a meld, a player needs to have 1 card of each of the 10 types. Melds are played face up and score points equal to the total point value of all the cards in the meld.  If the total of the friend cards is greater than the total of the foe cards an extra 5 meld points are scored. All meld cards are discarded after scoring. &#10;     End Phase: Max hand size is 10 cards.  Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The winner is the player to be the first to score 70 meld points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A quest style game using track, cards, and dice for one or more players, based on the Resident Evil franchise. Each player is a team of Operatives, Mercs, and/or Survivors that have infiltrated a Top Secret Underground Umbrella Corporation Research Facility with the intent to destroy it. The teams will fight zombies, mutants, Umbrella employees, and facility defences. They will be aided by cards representing weapons, Alice, and new recruits. &#10; There are 4 common decks: &#10;Agent Deck - Contains agents you can recruit for your team. &#10;Aid Deck - Helpful events and things you find along the way.  &#10;Encounter Deck - Foes and unfavourable events. &#10;Boss Deck - Big Monsters&#10;Agents and Foes have stats for Life, Evade, Attacks Initiative, Aim and Strength.&#10;&#10;The facility is represented by a track that is 40 spaces long.  The first space is the entrance. The end space is the final encounter.&#10;&#10;Each player draws 7 cards from the Agent deck and discards one. Players start with 3 Aid cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 6 phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Aid Phase&#10;-    Draw 1 Aid card and add it to your hand.&#10;&#10;2.   Recruit Phase&#10;-    Some Action Aid cards are played in this phase.&#10;&#10;3.   Move Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D6 and move your marker forward that many spaces. If you land on another player&rsquo;s pawn immediately move forward 1 space.&#10;&#10;4.   Encounter Phase&#10;-    Draw 1 card from the Encounter deck. This will be something you have to fight this turn. If you reached the final space draw a card from the Boss deck instead of the Encounter deck.&#10;&#10;5.   Fight Phase&#10;-    Units make attacks in order of Initiative. &#10;-    When making an attack roll 1D10: if this is equal to or less than the Aim score then the attack hits. &#10;-    The defending unit then rolls 1D10: if this equal to or less than the Evade score of the Unit then the attack is negated. &#10;-    Attacks that hit and are not evaded do damage. A Unit that has more damage than life is killed. &#10;-    During a fight phase turn all Units get to attack (usually just once)&#10;-    Repeat the Fight Phase sequence until one side is completely killed off or an Aid card allows you to escape.&#10;&#10;6.   End Phase&#10;-    Make contamination checks if the Agent has been damaged but not killed to determine if they will turn into a zombie. &#10;-    Max hand size is 6 cards. Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to make it to the end of the track and destroy the Boss Monster encountered there.&#10;&#10;",

We suggest something non-edible)&#10;     The 2-Player Starter Deck Pack&#10;     A printer&#10;     Adobe Acrobat or another PDF viewer installed on your computer.&#10;&#10;&#10;Instructions for printing&#10;&#10;     Download the 2-Player Playing Card Pack.&#10;     Print onto cardstock (preferred) or regular paper.&#10;         The card game pack is set up for double-sided printing, if your printer has that feature. Choose &ldquo;Flip on long edge&rdquo; to print both sides simultaneously.&#10;         If your printer does not have double-sided printing, in order to get cards that are printed on both sides, you can choose to print only the odd pages first, reverse-order the pages, then place them back into the printer and print the even pages.&#10;         If your paper is lightweight, I suggest you print single-sided only and glue two pages together before cutting.&#10;         Color printing is highly recommended.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;(As all printer setups differ, I cannot provide much troubleshooting with this step. If you're having issues, contact someone you know who you think can resolve it locally)&#10;&#10;     Once printed, cut out all your cards. Try to give them a uniform appearance.&#10;     You're ready to play!&#10;&#10;&#10;Welcome to Lanterns: Alpha Demo Decks&#10;The Lanterns: Alpha Demo Decks features characters mostly from the 2016 DC Rebirth Event comics up to now. Alpha Demo Decks is the first series of cards and features 28 different cards. It was released in July 2017 on the Lanterns: The War of the Lights Facebook page and features Green Lantern Corps vs. Sinestro Corps displayed as a Print N'Play 62 Cards Two-Player Starter Set.&#10;&#10;",
